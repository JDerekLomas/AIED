To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question asks students to compare \(\frac{5}{9}\) and \(\frac{7}{12}\) and determine the correct sign to make the statement true. This involves converting the fractions to a comparable form, either by finding a common denominator or by converting them to decimals.

## Step 1: Understanding the Fractions
\(\frac{5}{9}\) and \(\frac{7}{12}\) can be compared by converting them to decimals or finding a common denominator. The common denominator would be 36.

## 2: Converting to Decimals or Common Denominator
- \(\frac{5}{9} = 0.555...\)
- \(\frac{7}{12} = 0.583...\)
Alternatively, with a common denominator:
- \(\frac{5}{9} = \frac{5 \times 4}{9 \times 4} = \frac{20}{36}\)
- \(\frac{7}{12} = \frac{7 \times 3}{12 \times 3} = \frac{21}{36}\)

## 3: Comparison
From the decimals, it's clear that \(\frac{5}{9} < \frac{7}{12}\) because \(0.555... < 0.583...\). With the common denominator, \(\frac{20}{36} < \frac{21}{36}\), confirming the inequality.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with fraction comparisons and decimal conversions. They might incorrectly compare the fractions or not understand how to convert them. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, with \(B = < \) being the correct answer but potentially a significant percentage choosing \(C = \) or \(D = \approx \) due to misunderstandings. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 40\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in conversion or comparison. They are more likely to get it right than the below basic group but might still opt for \(C = \) or \(A = \) due to miscalculations. \(A = 30\%\), \(B = 60\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with fractions and decimals. They should accurately compare the fractions and choose \(B = < \). Errors might come from calculation mistakes. \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 85\%\), \(C = 3\%\), \(D = 2\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their mathematical abilities and should easily and accurately determine that \(\frac{5}{9} < \frac{7}{12}\). The chance of error is minimal. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 90\%\), \(C = 4\%\), \(D = 1\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=4% D=1%
