To approach this question, let's analyze the algebraic process involved and the common misconceptions students might have.

The expression given is \(-(1-2p)\). To expand this, we apply the distributive property (or FOIL method for binomials, but here it's more about distributing the negative sign):

\[
-(1-2p) = -1 + 2p
\]

This means the correct answer is A: \(-1 + 2p\).

## Step 1: Identifying Common Misconceptions
A common misconception when dealing with negatives and distributing is forgetting to change the signs of all terms inside the parentheses when multiplying by a negative number. So, students might incorrectly distribute the negative sign or forget to apply it to both terms inside the parentheses.

## 2: Analyzing the Options with Misconceptions in Mind
- Option A: \(-1 + 2p\) is the correct expansion.
- Option B: \(-1 - 2p\) suggests that the negative sign was not distributed correctly to the \(2p\) term.
- Option C: \(1 + 2p\) suggests that the negative sign was ignored for the constant term and not distributed.
- Option D: \(1 - 2p\) suggests a similar misunderstanding, ignoring the effect of the negative sign on both terms.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and may not fully understand the effect of distributing a negative sign. They might choose options based on superficial understanding or guesswork. Expect a higher percentage to choose B, C, or D due to lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes or not fully apply rules consistently. They might still be prone to choosing B, C, or D, but perhaps to a lesser extent than below-basic students.
- **Proficient:** These students understand algebraic rules and are likely to apply them correctly. They should predominantly choose A, with fewer choosing B due to oversight, and very few choosing C or D.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the rules but are also adept at applying them in various contexts. They are likely to choose A with near certainty.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (they might get it by chance or have a glimmer of understanding), B=40% (common mistake), C=15% (another common mistake), D=15% (least likely but still a guess).
- **Basic:** A=60% (most get it right with some effort), B=25% (common error), C=10% (possible mistake), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Proficient:** A=90% (strong understanding), B=8% (rare mistake), C=1% (very unlikely), D=1% (very unlikely).
- **Advanced:** A=98% (virtually all get it right), B=1% (extremely rare mistake), C=0.5% (very rare), D=0.5% (very rare).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=8% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
