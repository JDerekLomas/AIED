To approach this question, let's analyze each option in terms of the mathematical concepts involved and the potential for students to recognize or fall into common misconceptions.

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( t^{2} - 27 = 0 \). This equation can be solved by adding 27 to both sides, resulting in \( t^{2} = 27 \). Taking the square root of both sides gives \( t = \pm\sqrt{27} \), which simplifies to \( t = \pm3\sqrt{3} \). This equation has real solutions.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( t^{2} = -27 \). Since the square of any real number cannot be negative, this equation has no real solutions. It only has complex solutions, \( t = \pm\sqrt{-27} = \pm3i\sqrt{3} \).

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( t^{3} = -27 \). This equation can be solved by taking the cubic root of both sides. Since \( -3^{3} = -27 \), \( t = -3 \) is a real solution. This equation has one real solution.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \( t - 27 = -27 \). Adding 27 to both sides gives \( t = 0 \). This equation has one real solution.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and understanding of squares, cubes, and negative numbers. They might incorrectly think all equations have solutions or might not fully understand the implications of negative numbers under roots. They could mistakenly choose A, C, or D because they seem to have straightforward solutions, or they might not identify B correctly due to lack of understanding of real and complex numbers. 
  - A: 30% (think it's solvable)
  - B: 20% (don't understand no real solutions)
  - C: 30% (seen as solvable)
  - D: 20% (simple addition/subtraction)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still fall into common traps. They should recognize A, C, and D have real solutions but might be less confident about B.
  - A: 80% (correctly see it as solvable)
  - B: 10% (recognize it as no real solutions)
  - C: 80% (see it as solvable)
  - D: 80% (see it as solvable)

- **Proficient**: These students understand quadratic and cubic equations and their solution sets. They should easily eliminate A, C, and D.
  - A: 90% (correct)
  - B: 90% (correctly identify no real solutions)
  - C: 90% (correct)
  - D: 90% (correct)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also reason about the nature of solutions to equations. They would quickly identify B as the equation with no real solutions.
  - A: 95% 
  - B: 95% 
  - C: 95% 
  - D: 95% 

Given the format required for the response and adjusting for the typical performance expectations:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=80% D=80%
proficient: A=90% B=90% C=90% D=90%
advanced: A=95% B=95% C=95% D=95%
