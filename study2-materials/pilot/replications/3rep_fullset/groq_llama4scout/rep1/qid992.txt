To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and the specific challenges that students at different ability levels might face when converting a percentage to a decimal.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to convert \(2\%\) into a decimal. The correct conversion involves dividing by 100, since \(\%\) means "out of 100". So, \(2\% = \frac{2}{100} = 0.02\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception is to confuse the conversion with other operations, such as multiplying by 10 or 100 to move the decimal point, or not moving it at all. Specifically, students might think \(2\% = 2\) (which would be \(200\%\)), or they might incorrectly move the decimal point.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
### Below Basic
Students at this level often struggle with basic concepts and might not fully understand the concept of percentages and decimals. 
- **A = 40%**: Incorrectly thinking \(2\% = 0.2\), possibly due to a miscalculation or misunderstanding of percentage to decimal conversion.
- **B = 20%**: Believing \(2\% = 2.0\), possibly due to a lack of understanding that \(2\%\) is less than 1.
- **C = 20%**: Correctly converting \(2\%\) to \(0.02\), showing some understanding.
- **D = 20%**: Writing \(200\), indicating a significant misunderstanding of percentage conversion.

### Basic
Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still make errors.
- **A = 20%**: Still some confusion with \(0.2\), maybe due to overconfidence in a mislearned rule.
- **B = 10%**: Less likely to think \(2.0\), as they understand \(2\%\) is not \(2\).
- **C = 60%**: Correct conversion to \(0.02\), demonstrating a grasp of the concept.
- **D = 10%**: Seeing \(200\) as an option, but recognizing it's incorrect.

### Proficient
Students here have a solid grasp of the concepts.
- **A = 5%**: Few would mistakenly choose \(0.2\).
- **B = 5%**: Unlikely to choose \(2.0\), understanding the scale.
- **C = 90%**: Majority correctly convert \(2\%\) to \(0.02\).
- **D = 0%**: Rarely, if ever, would a proficient student choose \(200\).

### Advanced
Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts accurately.
- **A = 0%**: It's unlikely any advanced students would choose \(0.2\).
- **B = 0%**: Similarly, \(2.0\) would not be chosen.
- **C = 100%**: All would correctly identify \(0.02\) as \(2\%\).
- **D = 0%**: No advanced student would choose \(200\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
