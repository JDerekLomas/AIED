To approach this question, let's first analyze the pie chart and the question being asked. The pie chart shows the distribution of hat colors owned by Tom: blue (90 degrees), yellow (approximately 195 degrees), red (approximately 40 degrees), and green (approximately 35 degrees). The total degrees in a circle is 360 degrees.

## Step 1: Calculate the total degrees of non-blue hats
To find the fraction of Tom's hats that are not blue, we first need to calculate the total degrees of non-blue hats. The degrees for non-blue hats = 195 (yellow) + 40 (red) + 35 (green) = 270 degrees.

## 2: Calculate the fraction of hats that are not blue
The fraction of hats that are not blue = (degrees of non-blue hats) / (total degrees) = 270 / 360. This can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 90. So, 270 / 90 = 3 and 360 / 90 = 4. Thus, the fraction = 3/4.

## 3: Evaluate the answer choices
- A: \( \frac{1}{4} \) - This would imply that 90 degrees represent \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the circle, which is incorrect because \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 360 degrees is 90 degrees, and indeed blue hats are 90 degrees, but we are looking for the fraction of non-blue hats.
- B: \( 75 \) - This option seems to represent a percentage or a whole number, but it's not clear what it directly refers to without context. If considering it as a fraction or percentage, \( 75 = \frac{75}{100} = \frac{3}{4} \), which matches our calculation.
- C: \( \frac{3}{4} \) - This directly matches our calculated fraction of hats that are not blue.
- D: Impossible to say - Given that we can calculate the fraction of non-blue hats directly from the information provided, this option does not apply.

## 4: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with fractions, percentages, and interpreting charts. They might find it hard to calculate or understand the question. Option D (Impossible to say) might appeal to those who don't understand how to interpret the chart or calculate fractions. Option B could be confusing or seem like a plausible numerical answer without calculation.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand basic fractions and chart interpretation. They could calculate the fraction or understand that blue is \( \frac{90}{360} = \frac{1}{4} \), implying non-blue is \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \). Thus, they might correctly choose C.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to easily calculate the fraction of non-blue hats and choose C. They might quickly see that blue hats are \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total, making non-blue hats \( \frac{3}{4} \).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students would likely have a straightforward approach to solving this, quickly identifying the fraction of non-blue hats as \( \frac{3}{4} \) and choosing C without hesitation.

## 5: Predict student responses
Given the above, let's predict the responses:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (misinterpretation), B=30% (random or misunderstood), C=20% (correct but by chance or simple insight), D=30% (lack of understanding).
- **Basic**: A=10% (simple mistake), B=5% (misinterpretation), C=80% (correct calculation or insight), D=5% (overcautious).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (error), B=0% (unlikely to misinterpret in this way), C=95% (correct), D=0% (clear calculation possible).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no error expected), B=0%, C=100% (straightforward correct answer), D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
