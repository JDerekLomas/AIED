## Step 1: Understanding the Pictogram and Its Scale
The pictogram provided has a key that indicates 1 tree picture represents 20 trees. This means that to represent the number of trees, we divide the number of trees by 20 to find out how many tree symbols are needed.

## 2: Identifying the Task
The task is to determine how many tree symbols are needed to represent 50 oak trees, given that 1 tree symbol equals 20 trees.

## 3: Calculating the Number of Tree Symbols Needed for 50 Oak Trees
To find out how many tree symbols are needed for 50 oak trees, we divide 50 by 20. This calculation is 50 / 20 = 2.5.

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors and Student Understanding
- **Misconception:** A common misconception might be to directly use the number of trees without considering the scale of the pictogram.
- **Easy Errors:** Students might incorrectly assume that the number of tree symbols directly corresponds to the number of trees without using the scale (leading to choosing A: 50), or they might misunderstand the scale entirely.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand the concept of the pictogram's scale or might not be able to perform the simple division. They are likely to choose A (50%) because they don't apply the scale, or they might randomly select an option.
- **Basic:** Students here might understand the need for the scale but could struggle with the division or misapply it. They might choose A (50%) for not using the scale or B (5%) if they mistakenly think of a different operation.
- **Proficient:** These students should understand the scale and be able to perform the division (50 / 20 = 2.5). Thus, they are likely to choose C (2.5%).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level will easily understand the scale and perform the calculation correctly, choosing C (2.5%). They are less likely to make errors.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Given the above analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=80% (not using the scale), B=10%, C=5% (correct but unlikely), D=5%.
- **Basic:** A=60% (common mistake), B=20%, C=15% (correct), D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=20%, B=5%, C=70% (correct), D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=5%, B=0%, C=90% (correct), D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=5% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%
