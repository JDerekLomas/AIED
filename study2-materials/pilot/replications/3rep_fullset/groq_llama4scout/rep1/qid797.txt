To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie regarding the function \(y = 3^x\).

1. **Tom's Statement**: Tom says there is no value of \(x\) that can make \(y\) negative. For the function \(y = 3^x\), since \(3^x > 0\) for all real values of \(x\), Tom's statement is correct. The function \(y = 3^x\) is an exponential function with a base greater than 1, and its range is all positive real numbers.

2. **Katie's Statement**: Katie says there is no value of \(x\) that can make \(y\) equal to \(0\). For \(y = 3^x\), there is no real value of \(x\) that can make \(y = 0\) because \(3^x > 0\) for all real \(x\). However, it's worth noting that as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(y\) approaches \(0\), but never actually reaches it. Thus, Katie's statement is also correct.

Given this analysis, both Tom and Katie are correct. The function \(y = 3^x\) never yields a negative value (supporting Tom) and never equals \(0\) (supporting Katie).

Now, let's consider the predicted percentages of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding exponential functions and their properties. They might not fully grasp why \(3^x > 0\) for all \(x\), potentially leading to confusion.
  - A=20% (some might incorrectly think only Tom is right due to misunderstanding)
  - B=20% (similarly, thinking only Katie is right)
  - C=40% (recognizing both are correct, but this requires understanding the function's behavior)
  - D=20% (thinking neither is correct, due to a lack of understanding)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to not fully grasping the implications of the function's properties.
  - A=10%
  - B=10%
  - C=70% (most understand both statements are correct)
  - D=10%

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid understanding of exponential functions and their graphs.
  - A=5%
  - B=5%
  - C=85% (most recognize both Tom and Katie are correct)
  - D=5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the functions but can also reason about their properties rigorously.
  - A=0% (unlikely to mistakenly think only Tom is correct)
  - B=0% (unlikely to think only Katie is correct)
  - C=95% (almost all understand both are correct)
  - D=5% (a small chance of overthinking or misinterpreting the question)

Thus, the response in the exact format requested:

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
