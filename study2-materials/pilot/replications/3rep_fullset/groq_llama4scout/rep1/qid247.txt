To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it may pose.

The question involves a simple transaction problem where we start with a certain amount of money in the till, add more money, and then subtract some money. The correct calculation to find out how much money was left is:

Start: \( £1,456 \)
Add: \( £7,347 \) (total = \( £1,456 + £7,347 = £8,803 \))
Subtract: \( £4,377 \) (total = \( £8,803 - £4,377 = £4,426 \))

So, the correct answer is \( £4,426 \), which corresponds to option B.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question seems straightforward, testing the student's ability to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) in the context of financial transactions.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrectly adding or subtracting the amounts given or misunderstanding the direction of the transactions (i.e., which amounts are being added to or subtracted from the initial amount).

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A (\( £13,180 \)) seems to be the result of adding all the numbers together: \( £1,456 + £7,347 + £4,377 = £13,180 \). This could appeal to students who misunderstand the nature of the transactions.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C (\( £2,970 \)) could result from a calculation error, such as \( £7,347 - £4,377 = £2,970 \) and then not adding the initial \( £1,456 \) or incorrectly calculating the final amount.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D (\( £10,268 \)) doesn't seem to directly result from a simple miscalculation based on the given numbers, suggesting it might be less likely to be chosen due to the specific arithmetic error.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic. They could mistakenly add all the numbers (Option A), incorrectly calculate the differences, or simply guess. So, A=30% (incorrectly adding), B=20% (correct but struggling), C=30% (another incorrect calculation), D=20% (guessing or another mistake).
- **Basic:** These students understand basic operations but might make careless errors. They are more likely to get it right but could be tempted by obvious incorrect options. So, A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level are confident with arithmetic operations. They are less likely to make simple mistakes. So, A=5%, B=80%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced:** These students are very confident and accurate. They would easily identify the correct answer and avoid misconceptions. So, A=0%, B=90%, C=5%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
