## Step 1: Understand the conjecture and the claim
The conjecture states that all numbers have an even number of factors because factors come in pairs. A counter-example to this conjecture would be a number that has an odd number of factors.

## 2: Recall the property of factors
A number has an odd number of factors if and only if it is a perfect square. This is because factors come in pairs, but for perfect squares, one of these "pairs" is actually the same number (the square root), resulting in an odd count.

## 3: Analyze Tom's claim
Tom says \(24\) is a counter-example. To verify, we check if \(24\) is a perfect square. Since \(24\) is not a perfect square (\( \sqrt{24} \approx 4.90 \)), it has an even number of factors, not an odd number. Thus, Tom is incorrect.

## 4: Analyze Katie's claim
Katie says \(16\) is a counter-example. Since \(16\) is a perfect square (\(4^2 = 16\)), it has an odd number of factors (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, which are 5 factors). Therefore, Katie is correct.

## 5: Determine the correct answer
Given that Tom is incorrect and Katie is correct, the right answer is B) Only Katie.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand the concept of factors and perfect squares. They might not correctly identify the number of factors for 24 and 16 or misunderstand the conjecture. A significant portion might choose A or D due to a lack of understanding. \( A=30\% B=20\% C=20\% D=30\% \)
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still make errors in identifying perfect squares or in counting factors. They might recognize 16 as a perfect square but struggle with the implications. \( A=20\% B=40\% C=15\% D=25\% \)
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of factors and perfect squares. They should recognize 16 as a perfect square and thus a counter-example but might be split on Tom's example. \( A=10\% B=60\% C=10\% D=20\% \)
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to understand the nuances of the question and the properties of numbers. They should easily identify Katie's example as correct and Tom's as incorrect. \( A=5\% B=80\% C=5\% D=10\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
