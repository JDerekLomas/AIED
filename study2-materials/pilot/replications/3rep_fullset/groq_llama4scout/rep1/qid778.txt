To approach this question, let's first analyze the equation and the proposed steps by Tom and Katie:

Given equation: \(4(m-1) = 20\)

Tom's step: \(4m = 21\)

Katie's step: \(m - 1 = 5\)

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Step
Tom's step involves distributing the 4 on the left side of the equation: \(4m - 4 = 20\). To isolate \(4m\), he adds 4 to both sides, which results in \(4m = 24\), not \(4m = 21\). So, Tom is incorrect.

## 2: Analyze Katie's Step
Katie's step involves dividing both sides of the original equation by 4: \(m - 1 = 5\). This is a valid first step because if \(4(m-1) = 20\), then dividing both sides by 4 gives \(m - 1 = 5\). So, Katie is correct.

## 3: Evaluate the Options
- A: Only Tom is incorrect, so this option is wrong.
- B: Only Katie is correct, which aligns with our analysis.
- C: Both Tom and Katie cannot be correct since Tom's step is incorrect.
- D: Neither is correct is wrong because Katie is correct.

## 4: Consider Student Understanding
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulation and may not recognize the correct first step. They might incorrectly choose Tom's option due to a lack of understanding of how to solve equations or might choose D because they see Tom is wrong but don't understand Katie's step. Expect a high chance of error, with potentially B being lower than D due to the lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and are more likely to see Katie's step as correct. They might still be tricked into thinking Tom could be right or not understand why Tom is wrong, leading to some selection of A or D.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand the algebraic steps well and recognize Katie's step as correct and Tom's as incorrect, making B a likely choice.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to not only understand but also to apply concepts accurately. They should easily identify Katie as correct and Tom as incorrect.

## 5: Predicting Student Choices
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (some understanding of simple algebra but might be misled), B=20% (recognize Katie but not fully understand implications), C=10% (unlikely to understand both correctly), D=40% (lack of understanding leads to dismissal of both).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=50%, C=10%, D=20%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=70%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
