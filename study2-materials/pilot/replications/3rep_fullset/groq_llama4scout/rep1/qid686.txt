## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The question provides a table of values for the equation \( y = x^2 - x + 3 \) and asks to find the value of \( y \) when \( x = -1 \), denoted by \( \bigstar \).

## 2: Identify the equation and the value of x for the missing y
The equation given is \( y = x^2 - x + 3 \), and we need to find \( y \) when \( x = -1 \).

## 3: Substitute \( x = -1 \) into the equation to find \( y \)
Substituting \( x = -1 \) into \( y = x^2 - x + 3 \) gives \( y = (-1)^2 - (-1) + 3 \).

## 4: Calculate the value of \( y \)
Calculating \( y = (-1)^2 - (-1) + 3 = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 \).

## 5: Consider the potential for student errors
This question tests the ability to substitute values into a quadratic equation. The potential error could be in the substitution process or in the calculation. However, given that the numbers are simple and the calculation straightforward, the main error would likely come from incorrect substitution or arithmetic mistakes.

## 6: Analyze the answer choices
The answer choices are \( A = -3 \), \( B = 5 \), \( C = 3 \), and \( D = 6 \). The correct answer, based on our calculation, is \( B = 5 \).

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substitution and calculation. They might incorrectly substitute \( x = -1 \) into the equation or make arithmetic mistakes. Given the simplicity of the calculation, some might guess or incorrectly calculate, potentially leading to \( A = -3 \) (if they forget to add the 3 or incorrectly handle the negative), \( C = 3 \) (if they only consider \( x^2 + 3 \) without the \( -x \) term), or \( D = 6 \) (if they add incorrectly). However, without strong algebraic skills, \( B = 5 \) might not be immediately obvious, so we could see a spread but potentially with \( B \) being less common.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to substitute and calculate but might make simple arithmetic errors. They are more likely to get it right but could be tempted by incorrect calculations leading to \( A \), \( C \), or \( D \).
- **Proficient**: These students should easily substitute \( x = -1 \) into the equation and calculate \( y = 5 \) correctly. They are less likely to make errors, so \( B = 5 \) should be a high percentage.
- **Advanced**: These students will almost certainly get it right, as they are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and calculations.

## 8: Estimate percentages for each ability level
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation:
- **Below Basic**: \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 30\% \) (guessing or simple errors)
- **Basic**: \( A = 10\% \), \( B = 70\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 10\% \) (most get it right but some make simple errors)
- **Proficient**: \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 90\% \), \( C = 3\% \), \( D = 2\% \) (mostly correct with few errors)
- **Advanced**: \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 98\% \), \( C = 1\% \), \( D = 1\% \) (almost all get it right)

The best answer is B.
