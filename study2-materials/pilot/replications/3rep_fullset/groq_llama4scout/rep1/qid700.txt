To approach this question, let's analyze the algebraic expression given: \( \frac{t^{2}-1}{t+1} \). This expression can be simplified using the difference of squares identity, which states that \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \). Applying this to the numerator, we get \( t^2 - 1 = (t - 1)(t + 1) \). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[ \frac{(t - 1)(t + 1)}{t + 1} \]

For \( t \neq -1 \), we can cancel out the \( (t + 1) \) terms, leaving us with:

\[ t - 1 \]

This means the correct answer is \( t - 1 \), which corresponds to option C.

Now, let's consider how students at different ability levels might respond:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand algebraic manipulation or might not recognize the difference of squares. They might also not see how to cancel terms. A significant portion might think the expression simplifies to \( t \) (A) or \( t + 1 \) (B) due to a lack of understanding of algebraic simplification. Some might not attempt to simplify. 
  - A: \( t \): 30%
  - B: \( t + 1 \): 25%
  - C: \( t - 1 \): 20%
  - D: Does not simplify: 25%

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and might recognize the difference of squares but could struggle with the cancellation step or might misunderstand it. 
  - A: \( t \): 15%
  - B: \( t + 1 \): 10%
  - C: \( t - 1 \): 60%
  - D: Does not simplify: 15%

- **Proficient:** These students are likely to understand the algebraic manipulation involved. They should recognize the difference of squares and be able to cancel terms correctly.
  - A: \( t \): 5%
  - B: \( t + 1 \): 2%
  - C: \( t - 1 \): 90%
  - D: Does not simplify: 3%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the algebra but also any nuances or conditions (like \( t \neq -1 \)). They should have a very high success rate with this type of question.
  - A: \( t \): 1%
  - B: \( t + 1 \): 1%
  - C: \( t - 1 \): 95%
  - D: Does not simplify: 3%

Given the analysis:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
