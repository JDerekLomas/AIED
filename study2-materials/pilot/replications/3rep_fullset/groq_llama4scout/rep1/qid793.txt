To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions or traps it may contain, especially considering the coordinates of the points given: \( (1,-6) \) and \( (-5,2) \).

The correct formula for calculating the distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in a coordinate plane is:
\[ \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]
This corresponds to option B.

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( \sqrt{(x_2 + x_1)^2 - (y_2 + y_1)^2} \). This formula does not correctly represent the distance between two points. It seems to confuse the concept with that of a difference of squares or possibly a misconception about how distances are calculated.

## 2: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right) \), gives the midpoint between two points, not the distance.

## 3: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \), represents the slope of the line passing through the two points, not the distance.

## 4: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not recognize the correct formula or might confuse it with other formulas. They might choose A because it looks similar to the distance formula but with a subtraction inside the square root, which could seem plausible to some. Option B is the correct answer, but these students might not identify it. C and D are clearly incorrect for distance but might appeal due to lack of understanding. 
  - A: 30% (misconception about formula)
  - B: 20% (recognize correct formula)
  - C: 20% (confuse with midpoint)
  - D: 30% (confuse with slope)

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might still make errors.
  - A: 15% (less likely to fall for incorrect formula)
  - B: 60% (recognize and choose correct formula)
  - C: 15% (might confuse with midpoint)
  - D: 10% (less likely to confuse with slope)

- **Proficient:** These students are familiar with the formulas.
  - A: 5% (unlikely to fall for incorrect formula)
  - B: 80% (correctly choose distance formula)
  - C: 5% (unlikely to confuse with midpoint)
  - D: 10% (might consider slope but unlikely to choose)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their understanding.
  - A: 0% (not likely to confuse)
  - B: 95% (confidently choose correct formula)
  - C: 0% (not confused with midpoint)
  - D: 5% (extremely unlikely to consider slope)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
