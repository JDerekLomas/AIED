To approach this question, let's consider what is being tested: the definition of a regular polygon. A regular polygon is a shape with at least three sides where all sides are of equal length, and all internal angles are equal.

1. **Understanding Regular Polygons**: 
   - A regular polygon has two key properties: all sides must be equal in length, and all angles must be equal.

2. **Analyzing Tom's Statement**:
   - Tom claims a rhombus is a regular polygon. A rhombus by definition has all sides of equal length, but not all rhombi have all angles equal (only opposite angles are equal). A square, which is a special type of rhombus, is a regular polygon because it meets both criteria (all sides are equal and all angles are right angles, thus equal). However, not all rhombi are squares.

3. **Analyzing Katie's Statement**:
   - Katie claims a rectangle is a regular polygon. For a rectangle, opposite sides are equal in length and all angles are right angles (thus equal). However, for a rectangle to be considered a regular polygon, it must also have all sides of equal length, which is not true for all rectangles (only for squares).

4. **Predicting Student Responses**:
   - **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the definitions. They might not fully understand what makes a polygon regular. There's a chance they could incorrectly agree with both or either based on superficial characteristics. 
     - A=30% (some might think rhombus is special), B=30% (similar reasoning for rectangle), C=20% (both are special cases), D=20% (completely unsure).
   - **Basic**: At this level, students have a better grasp of basic geometric shapes but might still confuse properties. They might recognize a square as a regular polygon but struggle with the nuances of rhombi and rectangles.
     - A=25% (rhombus can be seen as a special case), B=25% (rectangle can be seen as a special case), C=30% (some understand both can be regular under specific conditions), D=20% (still unsure about conditions).
   - **Proficient**: Students here understand the definitions well but might need a moment to apply them. They should recognize a square as a regular polygon and understand that not all rhombi or rectangles qualify unless they are squares.
     - A=10% (only if they mistakenly think all rhombi are regular), B=10% (similarly for rectangles), C=70% (most understand both can be correct if referring to a square), D=10% (if they see through both).
   - **Advanced**: These students are well-versed in geometric properties and should easily apply the definition to both shapes, recognizing that both can represent regular polygons under the condition that they are squares.
     - A=5% (error due to haste or misinterpretation), B=5% (similar), C=85% (clear understanding that both refer to specific cases that can be regular), D=5% (perhaps if they see a trick question).

Given these considerations, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
