To approach this question, let's first understand what's being tested. The question aims to assess students' understanding of calculating the mean (average) of a set of numbers. The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers in the set and then dividing by the count of numbers.

The set of numbers given is: \(0, 1, 3, 4, 7\).

The correct calculation for the mean is:
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5} \]

Let's analyze the options:

A: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) - This option ignores the 0, which is incorrect because 0 is a part of the dataset and should be included in the sum.

B: \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \) - This option suggests dividing 7 by 5 before adding the other numbers, which is incorrect due to the order of operations (division should not be performed before addition in this context).

C: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \) - This option not only ignores the 0 but also incorrectly uses 4 (the count of non-zero numbers) instead of 5 (the total count of numbers).

D: None of them - This would be correct if none of the provided calculations correctly compute the mean.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Calculation
The correct formula for the mean involves summing all numbers and then dividing by the count of numbers. So, the correct calculation is \( \frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5} \).

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \), omits the 0 from the sum, which is a common error. Students might mistakenly think that 0 does not contribute to the sum.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \), incorrectly applies the order of operations. It implies that 7 should be divided by 5 before adding the other numbers, which is not how mean calculation works.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \), both omits the 0 and uses the wrong divisor (4 instead of 5), compounding two errors.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D suggests that none of the provided calculations are correct. Given the errors in A, B, and C, if any of these were correct, D would be wrong. But if all are incorrect, D is correct.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding the concept of mean. They are likely to choose B (20-30%) because it seems to involve all numbers and operations, even though it's incorrect due to operation order. A might attract some (15-25%) because it at least uses the correct divisor. C could attract a few (10-20%) due to its simplicity, and D might be chosen by a small percentage (10-20%) who realize something is wrong but can't identify the correct calculation.

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a better grasp of basic arithmetic. They are more likely to recognize the importance of including 0 in the sum. A might attract (20-30%) because it uses the right divisor but omits 0. B could still confuse some (15-25%). C would likely decrease in popularity (5-15%) as students realize the error in counting. D might increase to (30-40%) as students see the flaws in A, B, and C.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the mean calculation well. They should quickly identify A as incorrect because it omits 0, B as incorrect due to operation order, and C as incorrect for both reasons. D should be the most popular choice (60-80%) because students recognize that none of the provided calculations perfectly match the correct mean calculation.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the calculation but are also less likely to fall for common misconceptions. They should overwhelmingly choose D (80-90%) because they see that A, B, and C are flawed in their own ways.

Given the analysis:

- **below_basic:** A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic:** A=25% B=20% C=10% D=45%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **advanced:** A=2% B=2% C=2% D=94%

So, in the required format:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
