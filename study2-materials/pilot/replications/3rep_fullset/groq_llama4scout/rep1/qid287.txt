To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions.

The question revolves around units of time. A common misconception among students is not understanding the difference between units of time and units of speed or other measurements. 

- Tom says "days" is a unit of time, which is correct. Days are indeed a unit used to measure time.
- Katie says "\( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \)" is a unit of time, which is incorrect. \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) is actually a unit of speed, representing kilometers per hour.

Given this, the correct answer is A) Only Tom, as Tom correctly identifies "days" as a unit of time, and Katie incorrectly identifies "\( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \)" as a unit of time.

Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with basic concepts, and there might be a higher tendency to confuse units. However, the concept that "days" is a unit of time is quite straightforward.
- A=60% (most would recognize "days" as a unit of time but might not fully understand or articulate why \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) is not)
- B=20% (some might incorrectly think \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) is a unit of time)
- C=10% (few would think both are correct)
- D=10% (few would understand that \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) is not a unit of time and days is, but not clearly articulate it)

### basic
At this level, students have a better grasp of basic units but might still make some errors due to lack of clarity or deeper understanding.
- A=70% (most recognize "days" as a unit of time and might start to see \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) as not)
- B=15% (some still might confuse \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) with a unit of time)
- C=5% (very few think both are correct)
- D=10% (a few understand neither is correct in the context provided)

### proficient
Students at this level have a solid understanding of various units and their applications.
- A=90% (most clearly understand "days" is a unit of time and \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) is not)
- B=5% (very few would still confuse \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) as a unit of time)
- C=2% (almost no one would think both are correct)
- D=3% (a small percentage might still misunderstand)

### advanced
At this level, students not only understand the concepts clearly but can also apply them accurately in various contexts.
- A=98% (almost all understand "days" is a unit of time and \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) is not)
- B=1% (very few would confuse \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) with a unit of time)
- C=0.5% (almost no one thinks both are correct)
- D=0.5% (very few might have a misunderstanding)

Therefore, the response in the exact format requested is:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
