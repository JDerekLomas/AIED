## Step 1: Understand the problem and the formula given
The problem provides a rectangle with an area of \(8 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\), where the base is labelled \(x\) and the height is \(x^2 + 9\). The area of a rectangle is given by base times height, so we have \(x(x^2 + 9) = 8\). However, instead of solving this equation directly for \(x\), Sally uses the iterative formula \(x_{n+1} = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{x_{n}^3}{9}\) to find \(x\), starting with \(x_0 = 0\).

## 2: Calculate \(x_1\) using the given iterative formula
To find \(x_1\), we substitute \(x_0 = 0\) into the formula:
\[x_1 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0^3}{9} = \frac{8}{9} - 0 = \frac{8}{9}\]

## 3: Analyze the question for potential misconceptions or traps
The question seems straightforward as it directly involves substituting into a given formula. However, the context of finding \(x_1\) from an iterative formula might confuse some students if they are not careful with the substitution process or if they misunderstand the formula.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting \(x_0 = 0\) into the formula or might not understand the iterative process. They could incorrectly calculate \(x_1\) or choose an option based on a miscalculation. Given the simplicity of the calculation, most might still get it right or choose an obviously incorrect option like C) \(0\).
- **Basic**: Basic level students should be able to follow the formula and calculate \(x_1\) correctly. They might be tempted by incorrect options if they misinterpret the formula or make a calculation error.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students should easily calculate \(x_1 = \frac{8}{9}\) and choose option A) \(\frac{8}{9}\) without issues.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will also calculate \(x_1\) correctly and choose option A) \(\frac{8}{9}\), but they might be less likely to consider incorrect options due to their strong understanding of mathematical concepts.

## 5: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the calculation \(x_1 = \frac{8}{9}\), and assuming most students can handle the simple substitution:
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (correct calculation), B=10%, C=20% (thinking \(x_1\) remains 0), D=10%
- **Basic**: A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%

The best answer is A.
