## Step 1: Understand the question and the task
The question requires finding a 3-digit number that, when added to 258, equals 1162, and then identifying the 3rd digit of this number. The task is to predict the percentage of students at different ability levels (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each given option.

## 2: Solve the equation to find the correct 3-digit number
To find the 3-digit number, subtract 258 from 1162.
\(1162 - 258 = 904\)

## 3: Identify the 3rd digit of the correct number
The 3rd digit of 904 is 4.

## 4: Analyze the potential for misconceptions or errors
The question is designed to test if students can correctly solve for a missing addend and then extract a specific digit from the solution. A common misconception might involve errors in subtraction or misunderstanding the place value of digits.

## 5: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the subtraction, potentially leading to incorrect answers. They might not accurately solve \(1162 - 258\) or might confuse the place values. Expect a higher chance of choosing incorrect options.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless errors or not fully understand the concept of place value and subtraction. They are more likely to get the subtraction right but could make mistakes in identifying the 3rd digit.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to solve the subtraction accurately and understand place value, making them likely to choose the correct option. Errors might still occur due to carelessness.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly likely to solve the problem correctly and understand the nuances of the question.

## 6: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the correct answer is D) 4:
- **Below_basic**: Might have a hard time with the calculation, potentially leading to A=20% (guessing), B=20%, C=30% (incorrect calculation), D=30%.
- **Basic**: Should be able to perform the calculation but might make small errors, so A=10%, B=10%, C=20%, D=60%.
- **Proficient**: Expected to perform well, with A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: Highly likely to get it right, with A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95%.

## 7: Format the response
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
