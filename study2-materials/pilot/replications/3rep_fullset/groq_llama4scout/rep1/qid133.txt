To approach this question, let's first understand the formulae and concepts involved in calculating the size of each interior angle in a regular polygon.

The sum of interior angles in any polygon can be found using the formula \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a regular polygon, since all angles are equal, the size of each interior angle can be found by dividing this sum by \(n\): \(\frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}\).

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's suggestion
Tom suggests \(\frac{18 \times 180}{20}\). This can be rearranged as \(\frac{(20-2) \times 180}{20}\), which matches the formula for the interior angle of a regular polygon: \(\frac{(n-2) \times 180}{n}\). So, Tom is correct.

## 2: Analyze Katie's suggestion
Katie suggests \(180 - \frac{360}{20}\). The exterior angle of a polygon is \(\frac{360}{n}\), and the interior angle can be found using the formula \(180 - \text{exterior angle}\). Thus, Katie's suggestion is \(180 - \frac{360}{20}\), which is also a valid method to find the interior angle of a regular polygon. So, Katie is correct.

## 3: Consider the difficulty level and potential misconceptions
Given that both Tom and Katie's methods are essentially correct and straightforward applications of polygon angle properties, the question does not heavily rely on complex calculations but rather on the understanding of the formulae. The potential for error lies in misunderstanding or misapplying these formulae. However, since both methods provided are directly derived from fundamental properties and are presented in a simple context, most students, even at lower ability levels, should be able to recognize their validity.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students might struggle with the basic formulae. However, the simplicity of the question and the direct derivation of both methods from basic principles might still lead to a significant portion recognizing both as correct. But, there might be a higher chance of error: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic geometric formulas. They should easily recognize both Tom's and Katie's methods as correct: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with geometric formulas and their applications. They should have no trouble understanding and validating both methods: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the formulas but can also derive and apply them in various contexts. They should confidently identify both methods as correct: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
