To approach this question, let's break down the information given and analyze the potential for student errors based on common misconceptions and the specifics of the question.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a scenario where Lethna pays different rates for electricity depending on the units used. For the first 100 units, she pays £0.25 per unit, and for any units beyond that, she pays £0.10 per unit. The task is to calculate the total cost for using 800 units of electricity.

## 2: Calculating the Cost
To find the total cost, we calculate the cost for the first 100 units and the cost for the remaining 700 units separately and then add them together.
- Cost for the first 100 units = 100 * £0.25 = £25
- Cost for the remaining 700 units = 700 * £0.10 = £70
- Total cost = £25 + £70 = £95

## 3: Analyzing Potential Student Errors
A common misconception might involve not changing the rate correctly after the first 100 units or miscalculating the costs. However, the graph provided in the question helps to visually reinforce the rate change, which might mitigate some errors.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic calculations or misunderstand the rate change. They might incorrectly apply the higher rate to all units or fail to add the costs correctly. Option C (£200) seems like a plausible mistake if a student incorrectly assumes a single rate of £0.25 for all 800 units (£200), or they might incorrectly calculate. 
  - A=10% (unlikely to choose the correct answer due to calculation difficulties)
  - B=20% (might guess or partially correct calculation)
  - C=60% ( incorrect assumption of a single rate or miscalculation)
  - D=10%

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic math operations but might still make errors in applying the rates or in calculation.
  - A=5% 
  - B=70% (correct calculation or intuition leading to correct answer)
  - C=15% (miscalculation or incorrect rate application)
  - D=10%

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept and can apply it correctly. Errors are less likely but could occur due to oversight or miscalculation.
  - A=5% 
  - B=85% (accurate calculation)
  - C=5% 
  - D=5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to understand the question and calculate accurately. 
  - A=0% 
  - B=95% (very accurate calculation)
  - C=0% 
  - D=5%

## 5: Conclusion
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation and the visual aid, most students, even at lower levels, should be able to grasp the concept and calculate correctly.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=70% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
