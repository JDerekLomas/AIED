## Step 1: Understand the question and the pictogram
The pictogram shows the number of people who came to watch a netball match across four games, with each smiley face representing 12 people. The distribution is as follows: Game 1 has 4 smiley faces, Game 2 has 2 smiley faces, Game 3 has 3 smiley faces, and Game 4 has 1 smiley face.

## 2: Calculate the total number of people
To find the mean number of people at each game, first, we need to calculate the total number of people across all games.
- Game 1: 4 smiley faces * 12 people = 48 people
- Game 2: 2 smiley faces * 12 people = 24 people
- Game 3: 3 smiley faces * 12 people = 36 people
- Game 4: 1 smiley face * 12 people = 12 people
Total people = 48 + 24 + 36 + 12 = 120 people

## 3: Calculate the mean number of people per game
There are 4 games in total. The mean number of people per game = Total people / Number of games = 120 / 4 = 30 people

## 4: Analyze the answer choices
Given the calculation, the correct answer is A: 30.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with reading the pictogram, calculating totals, or understanding what the mean represents. They might choose options based on simple arithmetic errors or misunderstanding the scale. Option D (120) might appeal as it represents the total, not the mean. A (30) seems correct but requires calculation. B (12) is the value of one smiley face. C (2.5) seems too low and doesn't relate directly to the smiley face value or total count easily.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to calculate the total and understand the concept of mean. However, they might still make errors in division or in interpreting the pictogram. They are likely to get it right but might be tempted by B (12) if they misunderstand the question.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily calculate the mean and understand the pictogram. They are likely to choose A (30) as they can accurately calculate the total and divide by the number of games.
- **Advanced**: These students will almost certainly choose A (30) as they not only understand the concept of mean but can also quickly and accurately perform the calculations.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each ability level
- **Below_basic**: A=40% (correct but through luck or simple calculation), B=20% (misunderstanding of the pictogram scale), C=10% (unlikely, as it requires a miscalculation), D=30% (total instead of mean).
- **Basic**: A=60% (correct calculation), B=25% (simple mistake), C=5% (miscalculation), D=10% (confusing total with mean).
- **Proficient**: A=85% (accurate calculation), B=10% (careless mistake), C=2% (unlikely error), D=3% (rare mistake).
- **Advanced**: A=95% ( confident in calculation), B=4% (very unlikely), C=0.5% (extremely unlikely), D=0.5% (extremely unlikely).

## 7: Convert estimates into the required format
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
- **basic**: A=60% B=25% C=5% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
