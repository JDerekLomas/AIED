To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the content it tests.

The question tests the understanding of properties of triangle numbers, square numbers, cube numbers, and Fibonacci numbers. Specifically, it targets a common misconception or a deeper understanding that might distinguish between students of different abilities.

**Understanding the Concepts:**

- **Triangle numbers** are numbers that can be represented as dots arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle. The nth triangle number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with n dots on a side, and it is given by the formula: \(T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).
- **Square numbers** are numbers that can be expressed as the square of an integer.
- **Cube numbers** are numbers that can be expressed as the cube of an integer.
- **Fibonacci numbers** are a series where a number is the addition of the last two numbers, usually starting with 0 and 1.

**The Property in Question:**
The sum of consecutive triangle numbers can be examined through their formulas. If we take two consecutive triangle numbers, \(T_n\) and \(T_{n+1}\), their sum can be expressed as:
\[T_n + T_{n+1} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} = \frac{n^2 + n + n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} = \frac{2n^2 + 4n + 2}{2} = n^2 + 2n + 1 = (n+1)^2\]

This result shows that the sum of consecutive triangle numbers is indeed a **square number**.

**Predicting Student Responses:**

- **below_basic:** Students at this level might not have a strong grasp of the formulas or the properties of these special numbers. They might guess or recall a wrong property. Given the difficulty, A=40% (guessing the most commonly associated property), B=20% (might recall triangle numbers but not the specific property), C=15% (less likely, as cube numbers aren't commonly associated with simple sums), D=25% (Fibonacci sequence might be confused with other sequences).

- **basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding but might struggle with proving or recalling specific properties. A=60% (likely to recall or deduce the correct property with some effort), B=25% (still a plausible wrong answer), C=5% (cube numbers are less likely), D=10%.

- **proficient:** Students here have a good grasp of the formulas and properties. A=80% (confidently recall the property), B=15% (some might get confused), C=2% (unlikely), D=3%.

- **advanced:** These students not only know the properties but can also derive them. A=95% (very confident), B=3% (rare confusion), C=1% (very unlikely), D=1%.

**Formatting the Response:**

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
