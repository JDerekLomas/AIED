To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it might pose.

The question involves adding two vectors:
\[ \left(\begin{array}{l}2 \\ 3\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}-1 \\ 0\end{array}\right) \]

To add vectors, we simply add their corresponding components. So, the correct calculation is:
\[ \left(\begin{array}{l}2 \\ 3\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}-1 \\ 0\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{l}2 + (-1) \\ 3 + 0\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \]

This corresponds to option A.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at different ability levels (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each of the given options.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve incorrect addition or misunderstanding of negative numbers. For example, some students might struggle with adding a negative number or might incorrectly add the components.

## 3: Analyzing Option A - Correct Answer
Option A, \( \left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \), is the correct answer. Students who understand vector addition and can handle basic arithmetic operations should choose this option.

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( \left(\begin{array}{c}-2 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \), suggests an incorrect operation, possibly indicating a struggle with negative numbers or incorrect subtraction instead of addition.

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \left(\begin{array}{c}-2 \\ 0\end{array}\right) \), implies a misunderstanding of both components' additions.

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( \left(\begin{array}{l}3 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \), suggests adding the numbers instead of adding their corresponding components.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle significantly with basic arithmetic and vector concepts. They may randomly select or make significant errors. Option A (correct) might be chosen by a small percentage (e.g., 20%), with the rest scattered across B, C, and D, possibly with a slight inclination towards D due to a simplistic addition approach.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundation but may still make arithmetic errors. They are more likely to choose A (correct) but might also consider B or C due to arithmetic mistakes. Let's assume A=60%, with B, C, and D making up the rest, possibly B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students should comfortably choose A (correct), with minimal errors. Let's assume A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should have no issues with the question. Virtually all should choose A. Let's assume A=98%, with the rest choosing other options due to careless mistakes or testing alternative operations (B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%).

## 8: Providing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced**: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
