## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question requires students to solve a system of linear equations graphically. The equations given are \(3x + 2y = 12\) and \(y = 3 - x\). Students need to find which of the provided diagrams correctly represents the graphical solution to these equations.

## 2: Solve the Equations
First, let's solve these equations algebraically to understand their point of intersection, which is crucial for evaluating the graphical representations.

### Equation 1: \(3x + 2y = 12\)
### Equation 2: \(y = 3 - x\)

Substitute \(y\) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:
\(3x + 2(3 - x) = 12\)

Simplify:
\(3x + 6 - 2x = 12\)
\(x + 6 = 12\)
\(x = 6\)

Then, substitute \(x = 6\) into Equation 2 to find \(y\):
\(y = 3 - 6 = -3\)

So, the point of intersection is \((6, -3)\).

## 3: Analyze the Diagrams
- **Diagram A**: The blue line goes through \((-10, -7)\) and \((10, 12)\), and the red line goes through \((0, -6)\) and \((10, 9)\). This doesn't seem to match our solution directly, but let's check the others.
- **Diagram B**: The blue line goes through \((-3, 0)\) and \((0, 3)\), and the red line goes through \((0, 6)\) and \((4, 0)\). The slopes and intercepts don't immediately align with our equations.
- **Diagram C**: Both lines slope downwards and go through \((0, 6)\) and \((6, 0)\) for one, and \((0, 6)\) and \((4, 0)\) for the other, which suggests they might be parallel or the same line, not intersecting at a single point that matches our solution.
- **Diagram D**: The blue line goes through \((0, 3)\) and \((3, 0)\), and the red line goes through \((2, 3)\) and \((4, 0)\). Let's check if either aligns with our equations.

## 4: Evaluate Each Equation Graphically
- The first equation, \(3x + 2y = 12\), can be graphed by finding two points. For \(x = 0\), \(y = 6\), and for \(y = 0\), \(x = 4\). This means the line passes through \((0, 6)\) and \((4, 0)\).
- The second equation, \(y = 3 - x\), passes through \((0, 3)\) and \((3, 0)\).

## 5: Match with Diagrams
- **Diagram B** matches our algebraic solution perfectly because one line passes through \((0,6)\) and \((4,0)\) and the other through \((0,3)\) and \((3,0)\), and they intersect at \((6, -3)\) if you look closely or calculate.

## 6: Prediction
Given the clarity of the solution and assuming students have basic graphing skills:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30% (Many might pick A or D due to visual appeal or incorrect slope/intercept assessment)
- **Basic**: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20% (Most would get it right or be misled by visually similar options)
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10% (Most would accurately identify B)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10% (Virtually all would choose B correctly)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
