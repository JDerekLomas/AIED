## Step 1: Analyze the sequence given
The sequence provided is 11, 15, 19, 23, ... . This sequence increases by 4 each time.

## 2: Determine the formula for the nth term
To find the position of the number 67 in the sequence, we first need to determine the formula for the nth term. The first term (a) is 11, and the common difference (d) is 4. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by: $a_n = a + (n-1)d$. Substituting the given values, we get $a_n = 11 + (n-1)4$.

## 3: Simplify the formula for the nth term
Simplifying the formula: $a_n = 11 + 4n - 4$ which gives $a_n = 7 + 4n$.

## 4: Solve for n when $a_n = 67$
Now, we set $a_n = 67$ and solve for $n$: $67 = 7 + 4n$. Subtracting 7 from both sides gives $60 = 4n$. Dividing both sides by 4 gives $n = 15$.

## 5: Evaluate the answer choices
- A: $16.75$ suggests a non-integer position, which could be a result of a miscalculation or incorrect application of the formula.
- B: $275$ seems too high and not related to the simple calculation we've done.
- C: $4n + 7$ is actually our formula for the nth term, not the position of 67 directly.
- D: $15$ matches our calculation for the position of 67 in the sequence.

## 6: Consider student misconceptions and errors
Students might struggle with:
- Identifying the sequence type and applying the correct formula.
- Solving for n correctly.
- Understanding that n must be a whole number.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students may not recognize the sequence or may incorrectly calculate the position. They might choose A because they see it as a possible decimal answer or B because it's a large number. C might be chosen if they confuse the formula with the answer. D is correct but might not be chosen due to lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students should be able to identify the sequence and calculate n. However, they might make arithmetic errors, leading to A or B. C could be chosen due to confusion. D should be recognizable as correct.
- **Proficient:** Students will likely calculate n correctly and choose D. They might be distracted by A if they make a calculation error or see C as a formula rather than an answer.
- **Advanced:** Students should easily calculate n and choose D without confusion.

## 8: Assign percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation and the sequence:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (miscalculation), B=20% (large number), C=20% (confusion with formula), D=30% (correct but requires understanding).
- **Basic:** A=15% (error), B=10% (large number mistake), C=10% (formula confusion), D=65% (correct calculation).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (minor error), B=5% (rare mistake), C=5% (recognize formula but not answer), D=85% (correct).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no errors expected), B=0% (no large number mistakes), C=0% (clear distinction), D=100% (correct).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=10% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
