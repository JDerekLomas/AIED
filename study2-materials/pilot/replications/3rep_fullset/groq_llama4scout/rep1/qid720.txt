To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required for each option.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks to identify which expression is always a multiple of 5 if \( n \) is a positive integer. This requires understanding what makes an expression a multiple of 5.

## 2: Analyzing Option A - \( n + 5 \)
For \( n + 5 \) to be a multiple of 5, \( n \) must be a multiple of 5. If \( n \) is not a multiple of 5, then \( n + 5 \) won't be a multiple of 5. This option might seem plausible but isn't always true for any positive integer \( n \).

## 3: Analyzing Option B - \( 2n + 3 \)
There's no direct indication that \( 2n + 3 \) would always be a multiple of 5 for any positive integer \( n \). The expression does not obviously factor into a form that guarantees it's a multiple of 5.

## 4: Analyzing Option C - \( 10n \)
\( 10n \) is always a multiple of 5 (and 10) for any integer \( n \) because 10 is a multiple of 5. This option seems straightforward and correct.

## 5: Analyzing Option D - \( 5n + 2 \)
For \( 5n + 2 \) to be a multiple of 5, \( 5n \) is a multiple of 5, but adding 2 means it's not a multiple of 5. This expression is not always a multiple of 5.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students might not fully understand what makes an expression a multiple of 5. They might choose options based on superficial similarities or misunderstandings. Option C seems obviously correct, but others might be chosen due to lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a basic understanding of multiples and simple algebraic expressions. They might recognize Option C as a multiple of 5 but could be confused by others.
- **Proficient**: These students should clearly understand what constitutes a multiple of 5 and be able to evaluate each option. They should predominantly choose Option C.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will not only understand the concept but also quickly evaluate each option. They should also predominantly choose Option C, with minimal errors.

## 7: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might think adding 5 makes it a multiple), B=15% (unlikely but could be chosen due to confusion), C=50% (recognize 10n as a multiple of 5), D=15% (think adding 2 doesn't affect being a multiple).
- **Basic**: A=10% (less likely to think n+5 is always a multiple), B=10%, C=70% (clear understanding of 10n), D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0-5%, B=0-5%, C=90-95%, D=0-5%.

The best answer is C.
