To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \bigstar \div 0.3=1.5 \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to solve for \( \bigstar \) in the equation \( \bigstar \div 0.3=1.5 \). This involves multiplying both sides of the equation by 0.3 to isolate \( \bigstar \), which yields \( \bigstar = 1.5 \times 0.3 \).

## 2: Solving the Equation
To find \( \bigstar \), we calculate \( 1.5 \times 0.3 = 0.45 \). This means the correct answer is B) \( 0.45 \).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Difficulties
- A common misconception or difficulty might arise from students not understanding how to handle division by a decimal or not correctly applying the inverse operation (multiplication) to solve for \( \bigstar \).
- Another potential issue could be students mistakenly using addition, subtraction, or incorrectly handling the decimal points.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic operations involving decimals, and there's a higher chance they might not understand how to solve for \( \bigstar \) correctly. They might choose an answer randomly or based on a common misconception. Let's assume A=20% (guessing), B=10% (actually solving it, surprisingly), C=30% (thinking multiplication makes the number bigger, but not calculating correctly), D=40% (another incorrect guess).

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of decimals and operations but might still make careless mistakes. They are more likely to attempt solving it but might struggle with decimal multiplication. Let's assume A=15%, B=60% (correct calculation), C=15%, D=10%.

- **Proficient:** Students at this level are comfortable with decimal operations and should solve the equation correctly most of the time. However, some might still make minor errors. Let's assume A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident and accurate with their calculations. They are likely to solve the equation correctly without any issues. Let's assume A=0%, B=95%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 5: Converting to Requested Format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
- basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
