To approach this question, let's consider the properties of rectangles and the common misconceptions students might have.

## Step 1: Understanding Rectangle Properties
A rectangle is a type of quadrilateral where all four angles are right angles (90 degrees), and opposite sides are equal in length and parallel. The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal in length. However, the diagonals of a rectangle do not necessarily intersect at right angles; this property is specific to squares, which are special rectangles where all sides are of equal length.

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
The misconception here could be that students think all rectangles have diagonals that intersect at right angles, due to confusing rectangles with squares. Alternatively, some might believe it's a property that only sometimes occurs, without realizing it's actually never true for rectangles with sides of different lengths.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: "always" suggests that all rectangles have diagonals intersecting at right angles, which is incorrect because this is only true for squares.
- Option B: "sometimes" implies there are cases where it happens and cases where it doesn't, which could reflect a misunderstanding since it's actually never true for rectangles with unequal side lengths.
- Option C: "never" indicates that rectangles with different length sides never have diagonals intersecting at right angles, which is correct.
- Option D: "I don't know" suggests uncertainty.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand geometric properties. They might incorrectly think that rectangles and squares share the same diagonal properties or not understand the question fully. So, they might choose A (20-30%), B (30-40%), C (10-20%), D (20-30%).
- **Basic:** Basic level students have a foundational understanding but might still hold misconceptions. They are more likely to recognize that not all rectangles have this property but might not articulate it precisely. So, A (10-20%), B (40-50%), C (20-30%), D (10-20%).
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the properties of rectangles and are less likely to confuse them with squares. They should know that diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other but do not intersect at right angles. So, A (5-10%), B (20-30%), C (50-60%), D (5-10%).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students have a deep understanding of geometry and are highly unlikely to confuse the properties of rectangles and squares. They should consistently choose the correct answer. So, A (0-5%), B (5-10%), C (80-90%), D (0-5%).

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Given the considerations above, here are the predictions in the required format:

below_basic: A=25% B=35% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=25% C=65% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
