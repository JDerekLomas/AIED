To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and the simplicity of the conversion involved.

The conversion factor between litres and cubic metres is that \(1 \, \text{cubic metre} = 1000 \, \text{litres}\). Therefore, to convert litres to cubic metres, one divides by 1000.

Given \(100 \, \text{litres}\), to find out how many cubic metres this is:
\[100 \, \text{litres} = \frac{100}{1000} \, \text{cubic metres} = 0.1 \, \text{cubic metres}\]

So, the correct answer is \(0.1\), which corresponds to option C.

Now, let's analyze the potential for errors based on student ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions or not understand the relationship between litres and cubic metres. They might incorrectly assume \(100 \, \text{litres} = 100 \, \text{cubic metres}\) (A) because they don't understand the conversion factor, or they might choose randomly.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic units but might not apply the conversion correctly. They might think \(100 \, \text{litres}\) is a large quantity and \(1 \, \text{cubic metre} = 1000 \, \text{litres}\), so \(100 \, \text{litres} = 0.1 \, \text{cubic metres}\), but could be insecure and choose incorrectly, such as B or D.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level are likely to understand the conversion and apply it correctly. They should recognize that \(100 \, \text{litres} = 0.1 \, \text{cubic metres}\), making C the correct choice.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the conversion but are also likely to have a strong conceptual understanding. They should easily and accurately convert \(100 \, \text{litres}\) to \(0.1 \, \text{cubic metres}\).

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic**: A=60% (common mistake of not converting), B=20% ( random or related mistake), C=10% (correct but challenging for this group), D=10% (another incorrect conversion).

- **Basic**: A=30% (still struggling with conversion), B=20% (might see 100 litres as 10% of 1000 litres and incorrectly apply), C=40% (correct conversion), D=10% (misapplication of conversion).

- **Proficient**: A=5% (minimal misunderstanding), B=5% (secure but careful), C=85% (correct and confident), D=5% (very rare mistake).

- **Advanced**: A=0% (very secure), B=0% (no chance of this mistake), C=95% (straightforward conversion), D=5% (an extremely rare error).

Therefore, considering typical student performance and potential for error:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
