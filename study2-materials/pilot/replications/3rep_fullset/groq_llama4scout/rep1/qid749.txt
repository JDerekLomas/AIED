## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to round the number \( 989.989 \) to the nearest ten. This requires understanding of rounding rules, specifically that if the digit immediately after the rounding place is 5 or greater, you round up, and if it's less than 5, you round down.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be rounding to the nearest hundred or not correctly applying the rounding rules. However, the specific numbers given might mitigate some common errors because \( 989.989 \) is close to \( 990 \), which could help guide students towards the correct answer.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 990 \)
- Option B: \( 1000 \)
- Option C: \( 989 \)
- Option D: \( 980 \)

## 4: Applying Rounding Rules
To round \( 989.989 \) to the nearest ten, look at the ones place, which is \( 9 \). Since \( 9 \) is greater than \( 5 \), we round the tens place up. Therefore, \( 989.989 \) rounded to the nearest ten is \( 990 \).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic rounding concepts. They might round to the nearest hundred or not understand the concept of rounding to the nearest ten properly. Option B (\( 1000 \)) might appeal to those who round to the nearest thousand or hundred incorrectly. Option D (\( 980 \)) could be chosen by those who mistakenly round down. A=40%, B=30%, C=15%, D=15%.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a grasp of basic rounding but might make simple errors. They are likely to choose A (\( 990 \)) but might be tempted by B (\( 1000 \)) or C (\( 989 \)) due to not fully understanding the rounding process. A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand rounding rules well and should easily identify \( 990 \) as the correct answer. A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very confident in their understanding and application of mathematical concepts, including rounding. They should almost universally choose A (\( 990 \)). A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
