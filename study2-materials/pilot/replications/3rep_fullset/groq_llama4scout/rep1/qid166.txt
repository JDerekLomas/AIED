## Step 1: Understand the question and the options provided
The question asks students to identify a correct second step to express a given division of fractions as a single fraction. The initial step provided is \( \frac{x-1}{6} \div \frac{x^{2}-1}{9} = \frac{x-1}{6} \times \frac{9}{x^{2}-1} \), which is correct as it applies the rule for dividing by a fraction.

## 2: Factor the denominator of the second fraction for clarity
The expression \( x^{2} - 1 \) can be factored into \( (x+1)(x-1) \) using the difference of squares formula. This gives us \( \frac{x-1}{6} \times \frac{9}{(x+1)(x-1)} \).

## 3: Analyze each option
- Option A: \( \frac{9 x-1}{6 x^{2}-1} \) seems incorrect because it doesn't properly simplify or factor the given expressions.
- Option B: \( \frac{-1}{6} \times \frac{9}{x-1} \) appears to introduce an error; there seems to be a misunderstanding in the factorization or simplification process.
- Option C: \( \frac{x-1}{6} \times \frac{9}{(x-1)(x-1)} \) suggests a mistake by using \( (x-1)(x-1) \) instead of \( (x+1)(x-1) \) for the denominator.
- Option D: \( \frac{x-1}{6} \times \frac{9}{(x+1)(x-1)} \) correctly applies the factorization of \( x^{2} - 1 \) into \( (x+1)(x-1) \) and seems to be a straightforward and correct step.

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and student errors
Students might struggle with factoring \( x^{2} - 1 \) correctly or might not cancel common factors properly. A common error could be not recognizing \( x^{2} - 1 \) as \( (x+1)(x-1) \) or incorrectly simplifying the expression.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand the division of fractions or factoring. They might choose A due to lack of understanding or B due to incorrect manipulation. C could be chosen due to partial understanding but incorrect application. D seems unlikely without proper understanding of factoring.
- **Basic:** Students here might start to understand fraction division but could struggle with factoring. They might lean towards A or C due to partial knowledge.
- **Proficient:** These students should understand both division of fractions and factoring. They are likely to choose D as it correctly represents the next step.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should easily identify D as the correct option without hesitation.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (random or incorrect operation), B=20% (misunderstanding of operations), C=20% (partial understanding), D=20% (correct but requires understanding).
- **Basic:** A=30% (still struggling with basics), B=15% (some misunderstanding), C=30% (partially correct but flawed), D=25% (starting to get it).
- **Proficient:** A=10% (error), B=5% (misconception), C=15% (careless mistake), D=70% (correct understanding).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (understand the concept), B=0% (no misconception), C=5% (unlikely but possible mistake), D=95% (confident in correct answer).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=30% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=15% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
