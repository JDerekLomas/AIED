To approach this question, let's analyze the function machines and the operations they represent, focusing on the order of operations and the distribution of the multiplication.

## Function Machine Analysis
- The correct application of operations in a function machine follows the order in which they are presented from left to right. 
- For the expression \(2p - 3\), the operations are: multiply \(p\) by 2, then subtract 3. This matches the first function machine in all options: \(p \rightarrow \times2 \rightarrow -3 \rightarrow 2p - 3\).
- For the expression \(2(p - 3)\), applying the operations: subtract 3 from \(p\), then multiply by 2. This translates to: \(p \rightarrow -3 \rightarrow \times2 \rightarrow 2(p - 3)\).

## Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: The first machine is correct (\(2p - 3\)), but the second machine incorrectly suggests \(2(p - 3)\) is achieved by \(\times2 \rightarrow -3\), which is incorrect.
- **Option B**: The first machine is correct (\(2p - 3\)), and the second machine correctly represents \(2(p - 3)\) with \(-3 \rightarrow \times2\).
- **Option C**: The first machine incorrectly suggests \(-3 \rightarrow \times2\) for \(2p - 3\), which is incorrect. The second machine correctly represents \(2(p - 3)\).
- **Option D**: Both machines are incorrect based on the previous analysis.

## Predicted Student Responses
### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with understanding function machines and the order of operations. They might be prone to selecting options based on superficial similarities rather than correctness.
- A: 30% (might seem correct due to matching numbers)
- B: 20% (seems plausible but requires understanding)
- C: 30% (similar operations but incorrectly ordered)
- D: 20% (less likely due to obvious errors)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make errors in applying the operations.
- A: 20%
- B: 40% (starting to understand the correct ordering)
- C: 25%
- D: 15%

### proficient
Proficient students understand function machines and the order of operations.
- A: 10%
- B: 60% (correct understanding of both)
- C: 20%
- D: 10%

### advanced
Advanced students have a strong grasp and can apply it accurately.
- A: 5%
- B: 80% (clearly understand the correct sequence)
- C: 10%
- D: 5%

Thus, the response in the required format:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
