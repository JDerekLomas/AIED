To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 1.5 \) hours \( = _______\) minutes, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to convert 1.5 hours into minutes. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 1.5 hours = \(1.5 \times 60 = 90\) minutes. This is a straightforward conversion problem.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions or Difficulties
A common misconception might involve incorrect conversion factors or misunderstandings of decimal numbers. For example, some students might think \(1.5\) hours is \(1\) hour and \(50\) minutes, which would be \(60 + 50 \times (60/100) = 60 + 30 = 90\) minutes, but more likely, they would simply miscalculate or not convert properly.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \(150\) minutes
- B: \(105\) minutes
- C: \(90\) minutes
- D: \(65\) minutes

The correct answer is C: \(90\) minutes.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions or have significant difficulties with decimals and time conversions. They might choose A (150) if they think 1.5 hours is 1 hour 50 minutes (which equals 110 minutes, but close to 150 if miscalculated), B (105) if they incorrectly calculate, D (65) if they significantly misunderstand the conversion, or C (90) if they somehow manage the conversion correctly despite their level.

- **Basic**: Students here should have a good grasp of basic conversions. However, they might still make errors due to miscalculations or incorrect applications of conversion factors. The correct answer, C (90), should be within their reach, but some might choose A (150) or B (105) due to calculation errors.

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a solid understanding of conversions, including time. They should easily convert 1.5 hours to 90 minutes, choosing C. Errors might still occur but should be minimal.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong foundation and should easily and accurately convert 1.5 hours to 90 minutes. They are less likely to make mistakes.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question and assuming most students have a basic understanding of time conversions:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (significant error, thinking 1.5 hours might equal 2.5 hours or similar), B=20% (miscalculation), C=40% (surprisingly correct), D=10% (large error).
- **Basic**: A=10% (occasional miscalculation to a high number), B=5% (less common miscalculation), C=80% (correct), D=5% (simple error).
- **Proficient**: A=2% (rare miscalculation), B=1% (unlikely error), C=96% (correct), D=1% (very rare error).
- **Advanced**: A=1% (unlikely), B=0.5% (very rare), C=98.5% (correct), D=0.5% (extremely rare).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=0.5% C=98.5% D=0.5%
