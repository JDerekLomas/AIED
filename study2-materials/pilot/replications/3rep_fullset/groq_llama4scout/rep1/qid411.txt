To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with adding numbers close to 100.

The question asks students to consider adding 97 to a number and then evaluate which of the given methods would yield the correct answer. Adding 97 can be thought of as adding 100 and then subtracting 3, which is a common mental math strategy.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Method
The correct method to add 97 to a number is to add 100 and then subtract 3. This is because \(97 = 100 - 3\), so if you add 100 and then subtract 3, you effectively add 97.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(+100\) then \(+3\). This would add 103, not 97.
- Option B: \(+100\) then \(-3\). This is the correct method for adding 97.
- Option C: \(-100\) then \(+3\). This would subtract 97, not add it.
- Option D: \(-100\) then \(-3\). This would subtract 103.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand the concept of adjusting numbers to make calculations easier. They might choose options that seem to add or subtract but don't necessarily understand the sequence. Option B is the correct answer, but due to a lack of understanding, they might opt for A or not recognize the correct strategy, leading to a spread across incorrect options. Prediction: A=40% (thinking adding more is correct but not adjusting), B=20% (some might get it through luck or basic understanding), C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and might recognize the strategy of adding 100 and then subtracting 3. However, they might also be tempted by straightforward addition/subtraction without adjusting. Prediction: A=30%, B=50% (as they start to grasp simple strategies), C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level are more likely to understand and apply the strategy correctly. They recognize adding 97 as adding 100 and then subtracting 3. Prediction: A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the strategy but can also reason through why it's correct. They are less likely to be swayed by incorrect options. Prediction: A=5%, B=90%, C=2.5%, D=2.5%.

## 4: Formatting the Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- basic: A=30% B=50% C=10% D=10%
- proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2.5% D=2.5%
