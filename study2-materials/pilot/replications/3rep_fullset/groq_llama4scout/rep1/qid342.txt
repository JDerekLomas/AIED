To approach this question, let's first define what an obtuse angle is. An obtuse angle is greater than \(90^{\circ}\) but less than \(180^{\circ}\). 

## Step 1: Analyzing the Options
We have four options: \(85^{\circ}\), \(270^{\circ}\), \(110^{\circ}\), and \(180^{\circ}\). 

## 2: Identifying Obtuse Angles
- \(85^{\circ}\) is less than \(90^{\circ}\), so it's acute.
- \(270^{\circ}\) is more than \(180^{\circ}\), so it's reflex.
- \(110^{\circ}\) is between \(90^{\circ}\) and \(180^{\circ}\), so it's obtuse.
- \(180^{\circ}\) is a straight line, not considered obtuse but a special case.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
The question is designed to test the understanding of angle types, specifically the definition of an obtuse angle.

## 4: Considering Misconceptions and Difficulty Levels
A common misconception might be confusing obtuse angles with reflex angles or not understanding the boundary conditions (\(90^{\circ}\) and \(180^{\circ}\)). However, this question is relatively straightforward because the angles provided are quite distinct in their categories.

## 5: Ability Levels and Predicted Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic definitions. They might confuse acute and obtuse or not understand the ranges. So, they might choose any option randomly or based on a very superficial understanding.
  - A: \(20\%\)
  - B: \(30\%\) (might think reflex angles are obtuse)
  - C: \(30\%\) (correct but might not recognize it)
  - D: \(20\%\) (might think it's obtuse since it's more than \(90^{\circ}\))

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make simple mistakes.
  - A: \(5\%\)
  - B: \(10\%\)
  - C: \(80\%\)
  - D: \(5\%\)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make mistakes.
  - A: \(0\%\)
  - B: \(0\%\)
  - C: \(95\%\)
  - D: \(5\%\)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately.
  - A: \(0\%\)
  - B: \(0\%\)
  - C: \(100\%\)
  - D: \(0\%\)

## 6: Formatting the Response
Given the analysis:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
