To approach this question, let's consider what makes a shape a prism. A prism is a polyhedron with two identical faces (the bases) that are parallel and oriented in the same direction. The other faces (the sides) are parallelograms. 

## Step 1: Identify the characteristics of Tom's shape
Tom's shape is described as a square-based pyramid. A pyramid has a polygonal base and triangular faces that meet at the apex. The base of Tom's shape is a square, but it does not have the characteristics of a prism because it does not have two identical parallel faces; instead, it tapers to a point.

## 2: Identify the characteristics of Katie's shape
Katie's shape is described as a cone. A cone has a circular base and tapers to a point (the apex). Like Tom's shape, it does not have two identical parallel faces and therefore does not qualify as a prism.

## 3: Analyze the misconception
The misconception here could be that students might confuse pyramids or cones with prisms due to their 3D nature. However, both shapes provided (a square-based pyramid and a cone) clearly do not meet the criteria for being prisms.

## 4: Consider student understanding at different levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the definitions of basic 3D shapes. They might confuse a pyramid with a prism or not recognize a cone as not being a prism. Expect significant errors.
- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding of shapes but might still struggle with nuanced definitions. They might recognize the pyramid and cone as not being prisms but could be uncertain.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the definitions well and should be able to accurately identify a prism's characteristics, easily recognizing that neither Tom's nor Katie's shape is a prism.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the definitions but can also apply them to complex scenarios. They would have no trouble identifying that neither shape is a prism.

## 5: Predict student responses
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (might think pyramid is a prism), B=30% (might think cone is a prism), C=10% (unlikely to think both are prisms), D=30% (recognize neither is a prism).
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=20%, C=5%, D=55% (more likely to understand neither is correct).
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85% (clear understanding that neither is a prism).
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (no confusion, clear understanding).

## 6: Quantify predictions
Given the understanding and potential for error:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=30% C=10% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=20% B=20% C=5% D=55%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=5% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
