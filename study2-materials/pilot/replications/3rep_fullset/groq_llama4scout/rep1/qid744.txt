To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions related to mathematical notation and geometry.

The notation ![Pair of parallel lines]() is intended to represent two parallel lines. The question tests the understanding of this notation and the definition of parallel lines.

- **Equal (A):** This option suggests that the lines are the same or identical, which is not what the notation indicates. Typically, students understand that equal lines would have the same equation or coincide, but the notation specifically indicates they do not coincide (since they are parallel, not the same line).

- **Parallel (B):** This is the correct answer. Parallel lines are lines that lie in the same plane and never intersect, which is exactly what the notation ![Pair of parallel lines]() signifies.

- **Perpendicular (C):** This option indicates lines that intersect at a right angle (90 degrees), which is a different relationship than what the notation shows.

- **Horizontal (D):** This option describes the orientation of lines relative to the horizon but does not relate to the relationship between lines as indicated by the notation.

Given these definitions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might not fully understand geometric terminology. They might confuse concepts or not understand the notation. 
  - A (Equal): 20% (some might think it means the lines are the same)
  - B (Parallel): 40% (some basic understanding but might not be secure)
  - C (Perpendicular): 20% (confusing with another relationship)
  - D (Horizontal): 20% (focusing on appearance rather than relationship)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to lack of practice or misunderstanding of terms.
  - A (Equal): 10% (starting to understand lines can be different)
  - B (Parallel): 60% (majority but still some confusion)
  - C (Perpendicular): 20% (some still confuse with right angles)
  - D (Horizontal): 10% (less focus on just orientation)

- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of geometric concepts and notation.
  - A (Equal): 5% (understand lines are not the same)
  - B (Parallel): 80% (strong understanding of the notation and concept)
  - C (Perpendicular): 10% (some residual confusion)
  - D (Horizontal): 5% (rarely focus on orientation alone)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of geometric concepts and can apply them accurately.
  - A (Equal): 0% (clearly understand lines are not equal)
  - B (Parallel): 95% (very secure understanding)
  - C (Perpendicular): 3% (rare confusion)
  - D (Horizontal): 2% (unlikely to be confused by orientation)

Based on these considerations:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
