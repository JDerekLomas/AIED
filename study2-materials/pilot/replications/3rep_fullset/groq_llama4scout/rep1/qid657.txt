To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question involves comparing integers, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics. The potential misconception here could be in comparing numbers based on their digits without considering their place value properly.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
Tom says \( 5000 \) is greater than \( 4987 \), and Katie says \( 3050 \) is greater than \( 3500 \). We need to assess the correctness of each statement.

## 2: Evaluating Tom's Statement
\( 5000 \) is indeed greater than \( 4987 \) because when comparing numbers of the same number of digits, we compare them digit by digit from left to right. Here, \( 5000 \) has a \( 5 \) in the thousands place, and \( 4987 \) has a \( 4 \) in the thousands place, making \( 5000 \) greater.

## 3: Evaluating Katie's Statement
\( 3050 \) is less than \( 3500 \) because the \( 3 \) in both numbers is in the thousands place, but \( 050 \) is less than \( 500 \), making Katie's statement incorrect.

## 4: Assessing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be comparing numbers based on the number of digits or without properly aligning them. However, in this case, both numbers for Tom and Katie are of the same number of digits, making the comparison straightforward.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic comparison skills or might not understand the concept of place value well. They might incorrectly compare numbers or make errors in basic arithmetic. Given the straightforward nature of the comparisons, some might still get it wrong due to lack of understanding. 
  - Tom is correct, Katie is incorrect: A = 60%, B = 20%, C = 5%, D = 15%
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic comparisons and place value. They are likely to get Tom's statement correct but might make mistakes on Katie's due to a lack of attention to detail or misunderstanding.
  - A = 80%, B = 10%, C = 5%, D = 5%
- **Proficient**: Students here have a good grasp of number comparisons and are less likely to make errors on simple comparisons like these.
  - A = 90%, B = 5%, C = 3%, D = 2%
- **Advanced**: These students have a strong understanding and are highly unlikely to make mistakes on such straightforward questions.
  - A = 95%, B = 2%, C = 2%, D = 1%

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
- **basic**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%

The best answer is A.
