## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question asks students to round the number $34590.8549$ to the nearest $100$. This requires understanding the rules for rounding numbers, specifically that if the digit immediately after the rounding place is $5$ or greater, the number in the rounding place is increased by $1$, and if it's less than $5$, the number in the rounding place stays the same.

## 2: Identify Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be rounding to the nearest $10$ or $1000$ instead of $100$, or not correctly applying the rounding rule. However, the specific number given, $34590.8549$, is designed to test the application of rounding to the nearest $100$. The decimal part $.8549$ is greater than $.5$, which suggests that the number should be rounded up.

## 3: Analyze the Options
- Option A: $34590$
- Option B: $34600$
- Option C: $34500$
- Option D: $35000$

## 4: Apply Rounding Rules
To round $34590.8549$ to the nearest $100$, look at the last two digits ($90$) and the decimal part ($.8549$). Since $.8549$ is greater than $.5$, we round up the $90$ to $00$ and increase the $5$ in $34590$ to a $6$, but since we're rounding to the nearest $100$, we actually look at the hundreds place and see that $590$ is closer to $600$ than to $500$. Therefore, $34590.8549$ rounded to the nearest $100$ is $34600$.

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic rounding concepts. They might round to the nearest $10$ or $1000$ incorrectly. Option A ($34590$) could be chosen by students who don't round at all or misunderstand the concept. Option C ($34500$) might be chosen by those who incorrectly round down. Option D ($35000$) could be selected by those who overestimate. Option B ($34600$) is the correct answer but might not be chosen by many due to a lack of understanding. Prediction: below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic rounding but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to choose the correct option but could be tempted by A or C due to simple errors. Prediction: basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of rounding concepts and are less likely to make simple mistakes. They should predominantly choose B. Prediction: proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concept but also apply it accurately with confidence. They are likely to choose B without hesitation. Prediction: advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%$.

## 6: Format the Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%
- proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
