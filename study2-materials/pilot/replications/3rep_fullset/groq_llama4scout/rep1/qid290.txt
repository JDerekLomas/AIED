To approach this question, let's break it down and understand what's being asked. Katie's theory is that \(2n^{2} - 1\) is always positive. A counter-example to disprove this theory would be any value of \(n\) for which \(2n^{2} - 1\) is not positive (i.e., either zero or negative).

## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to find which of the given options could serve as a counter-example to Katie's theory. This means we are looking for an option where \(2n^{2} - 1 \leq 0\).

## 2: Analyze option A
Option A is \(2\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2} - 1\). Let's calculate it: \(2\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2} - 1 = 2\left(\frac{9}{16}\right) - 1 = \frac{9}{8} - 1 = \frac{9}{8} - \frac{8}{8} = \frac{1}{8}\). Since \(\frac{1}{8}\) is positive, option A does not serve as a counter-example.

## 3: Analyze option B
Option B is \(2(0.5)^{2} - 1\). Let's calculate it: \(2(0.5)^{2} - 1 = 2(0.25) - 1 = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5\). Since \(-0.5\) is negative, option B serves as a counter-example.

## 4: Analyze option C
Option C is \(2(-2)^{2} - 1\). Let's calculate it: \(2(-2)^{2} - 1 = 2(4) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\). Since \(7\) is positive, option C does not serve as a counter-example.

## 5: Analyze option D
Option D is \(2(-1)^{2} - 1\). Let's calculate it: \(2(-1)^{2} - 1 = 2(1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\). Since \(1\) is positive, option D does not serve as a counter-example.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting values into the equation and calculating the results. They might not fully understand the concept of a counter-example. Option B is the only one that clearly provides a counter-example. Given the simplicity of calculations needed, most might get it wrong by not calculating properly or misunderstanding the task. However, those who do calculate might pick B if they find it results in a negative number. \(A=20\%\) \(B=40\%\) \(C=20\%\) \(D=20\%\)
- **Basic**: At this level, students understand basic algebraic manipulations but might still make errors in calculations or in identifying what constitutes a counter-example. They are more likely to calculate correctly and understand the requirement for a counter-example. \(A=10\%\) \(B=60\%\) \(C=10\%\) \(D=20\%\)
- **Proficient**: Students here are expected to handle algebraic expressions confidently and understand the concept of counter-examples. They should easily identify option B as a counter-example. \(A=5\%\) \(B=80\%\) \(C=5\%\) \(D=10\%\)
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand algebra well but also can think critically about mathematical statements and their counter-examples. They would quickly identify B as a counter-example without needing extensive calculation. \(A=0\%\) \(B=90\%\) \(C=0\%\) \(D=10\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
