## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question provides a table of values for the equation \(y = 2x + c\) and asks to find the value that should replace the star (\(\bigstar\)) in the table. The table is:
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l}
\( x \) & \( \) & \( 0 \) & \( 3 \) \\
\hline\( y \) & \( -7 \) & \( -5 \) & \( \bigstar \) \\
\end{tabular}
We need to determine \(c\) and then find \(y\) when \(x = 3\).

## 2: Finding \(c\)
To find \(c\), we can use any pair of \(x\) and \(y\) values from the table. Using \(x = 0\) and \(y = -5\):
\(-5 = 2(0) + c\)
\(-5 = c\)
So, \(c = -5\).

## 3: Verifying \(c\) with another point
Let's verify \(c\) using \(x = \) and \(y = -7\):
\(-7 = 2() + (-5)\)
This step actually requires the missing \(x\) value to verify \(c\), but we can still solve for \(\bigstar\) directly.

## 4: Calculating \(\bigstar\)
Now, substitute \(x = 3\) and \(c = -5\) into the equation \(y = 2x + c\):
\(y = 2(3) - 5\)
\(y = 6 - 5\)
\(y = 1\)

## 5: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting values into the equation or understanding the table. They might not correctly identify \(c\) or substitute \(x = 3\) correctly. Given the simplicity of the numbers, let's assume:
- A (6) could be a result of \(2*3 = 6\), ignoring \(c\): 40%
- B (-3) seems arbitrary without calculation: 20%
- C (1) is the correct answer: 20%
- D (-5) might be a guess or using \(y\) value for \(x=0\): 20%

- **Basic**: Students here should be able to follow a simple substitution but might make calculation errors:
- A (6): 20%
- B (-3): 15%
- C (1): 60%
- D (-5): 5%

- **Proficient**: Students should easily solve this:
- A (6): 5%
- B (-3): 5%
- C (1): 85%
- D (-5): 5%

- **Advanced**: These students should not only solve it correctly but also verify their answers:
- A (6): 2%
- B (-3): 2%
- C (1): 95%
- D (-5): 1%

## 6: Formatting the answer
Given the analysis:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
