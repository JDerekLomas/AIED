## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential misconception
The question asks to find \( 60 \mathrm{~m} \) as a percentage of \( 2 \mathrm{~km} \). A common misconception could involve not converting the units to the same type before calculating the percentage, or incorrectly applying the percentage formula.

## 2: Convert the measurements to the same unit
To solve the question correctly, first convert \( 2 \mathrm{~km} \) to meters: \( 2 \mathrm{~km} = 2000 \mathrm{~m} \).

## 3: Calculate the percentage
The formula to find a part as a percentage of a whole is \( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \times 100 \). Applying this: \( \frac{60}{2000} \times 100 = 3\% \).

## 4: Analyze the potential for errors
- A common error might be to calculate \( \frac{60}{2} \times 100 = 3000\% \) or mistakenly think of it as \( 60 \mathrm{~m} \) being a direct fraction of \( 2 \mathrm{~km} \) without proper conversion, leading to incorrect percentages.
- Another error could be confusing the conversion or the formula, leading to options like \( 30\% \) or \( 333\% \).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not even convert units correctly or apply the percentage formula. They might choose \( A = 333\% \) (incorrectly thinking \( 60 \mathrm{~m} \) is \( 333\% \) of \( 2 \mathrm{~km} \) due to a miscalculation or misunderstanding of scale), \( B = 30\% \) (a random guess or incorrect calculation), \( C = 3\% \) (correct, but this is a lower bound), or \( D = 60\% \) (also an incorrect guess).
- **Basic**: At this level, students might understand the concept but struggle with unit conversions or the calculation. They could incorrectly choose \( A \) or \( D \), with a higher chance of \( B = 30\% \) due to a rough estimation error.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students should understand both unit conversion and percentage calculations. They are likely to get it right, choosing \( C = 3\% \), but a small percentage might still make careless errors, choosing \( B \) or \( D \).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to handle such questions with ease, converting units and calculating percentages accurately. They should predominantly choose \( C = 3\% \), with very few errors.

## 6: Assign percentages
Given the nature of the question and assuming a typical distribution of understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (significant misconception), B=40% (common incorrect guess), C=10% (some get it right by chance), D=30% (another incorrect guess).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=30%, C=40%, D=20%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=1%, B=2%, C=96%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%
