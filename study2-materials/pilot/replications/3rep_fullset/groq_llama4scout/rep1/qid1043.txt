To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions.

The question requires students to compare the fractions $\frac{1}{5}$, $\frac{1}{6}$, and $\frac{1}{3}$. A common misconception when comparing fractions is not converting them to equivalent fractions with a common denominator or not understanding the relationship between the numerator and denominator.

## Step 1: Understanding the Fractions
To compare these fractions, let's convert them into equivalent decimals or find a common denominator. The fractions are $\frac{1}{5}$, $\frac{1}{6}$, and $\frac{1}{3}$. 

## 2: Converting to Decimals for Ease of Comparison
- $\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$
- $\frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667$
- $\frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333$

## 3: Comparing the Fractions
From the decimal conversions, it's clear that $\frac{1}{6} < \frac{1}{5} < \frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the correct comparison is $<$ between $\frac{1}{6}$ and $\frac{1}{5}$, and $<$ between $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$.

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A potential misconception could be that students might not correctly order these fractions, especially if they rely on the numerators or denominators in isolation without proper comparison.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic fraction comparisons. They might incorrectly assume that the fraction with the larger numerator is larger (which would be incorrect here since the denominators differ) or might not understand how to compare fractions at all. They are likely to choose an option randomly or based on a very superficial understanding. $A=20\%$, $B=40\%$, $C=20\%$, $D=20\%$
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of fractions and might be able to compare them with some effort. However, they might still fall into the trap of comparing numerators or denominators without converting. They are more likely to understand that $\frac{1}{6}$ is smaller than $\frac{1}{5}$ but might struggle with the relationship between $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$. $A=10\%$, $B=60\%$, $C=10\%$, $D=20\%$
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should be able to accurately compare fractions by converting to equivalent fractions or decimals. They understand that $\frac{1}{6} < \frac{1}{5} < \frac{1}{3}$, making $B$ the correct answer. $A=5\%$, $B=80\%$, $C=5\%$, $D=10\%$
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand how to compare fractions but can also do so efficiently. They would quickly identify the correct relationship without needing to convert to decimals. $A=0\%$, $B=90\%$, $C=0\%$, $D=10\%$

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
