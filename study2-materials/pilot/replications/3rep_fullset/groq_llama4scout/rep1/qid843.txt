To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions it targets.

The question focuses on the concept of congruent shapes, which means two shapes are congruent if one can be transformed into the other through rotation, reflection, or translation, and they have the same size. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept of Congruence
Congruent shapes must have the same size and shape. This implies that corresponding angles are equal and corresponding sides are of equal length.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom says two shapes are congruent if they are the same shape and size but have different orientations. This is a correct understanding of congruence because different orientations (through rotation or reflection) do not change the fact that two shapes are congruent if their sizes and shapes are the same.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie claims two shapes of different sizes are congruent. This is incorrect because for two shapes to be congruent, they must not only be of the same shape but also of the same size.

## 4: Evaluating the Difficulty of the Question
The question seems straightforward, testing the understanding of congruence. However, the subtlety lies in whether students recognize that orientation does not affect congruence (supporting Tom) and that size does (contradicting Katie).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the concept of congruence and could be easily misled by visual differences or misunderstand the criteria for congruence. They might incorrectly choose B (Only Katie) or C (Both Tom and Katie) because they don't fully grasp the definition.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and are less likely to be misled by obvious differences in size but might still struggle with the nuances of orientation and size. They might lean towards A (Only Tom) but could make errors.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept of congruence well and should easily identify Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect, leading them to choose A (Only Tom).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand congruence but are also adept at identifying incorrect statements. They would confidently choose A (Only Tom).

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (some understand Tom but not fully), B=30% (misunderstand congruence), C=20% (think both are right due to misunderstanding), D=10% (recognize both are incorrect).
- **Basic:** A=60% (understand Tom's correctness), B=20% (still some misconceptions), C=10% (some confusion), D=10% (few understand both are incorrect).
- **Proficient:** A=80% (clearly understand Tom is correct), B=10% (some residual misconception), C=5% (very few think both are correct), D=5% (a few recognize Katie's error but might not articulate Tom's correctness fully).
- **Advanced:** A=90% (clear understanding of congruence), B=5% (rarely, a misconception), C=3% (extremely few), D=2% (almost none).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
