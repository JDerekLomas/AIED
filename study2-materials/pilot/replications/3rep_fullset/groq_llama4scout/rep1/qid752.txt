To approach this question, let's analyze what it's testing and the potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question presents a pictogram with various flavors of crisps and their corresponding sales represented by smiley faces, with one smiley face equaling 12 people. The task is to identify what is missing from this pictogram.

## Step 1: Understanding the Pictogram
The pictogram shows different flavors of crisps and their sales: Salt and vinegar with 2 faces (24 people), Ready salted with 1 face (12 people), Prawn cocktail with 3.5 faces (42 people), and Other with 2 faces (24 people).

## 2: Identifying Potential Issues
A common misconception or error could involve misunderstanding what information is necessary for a pictogram to be complete, such as a key (which is provided in a sense by stating one smiley face = 12 people) or details about the question asked.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: What question was asked. Typically, a pictogram or graph doesn't need to explicitly state the question asked to understand the data presented.
- B: Nothing. This would imply the pictogram is complete as it stands.
- C: A key. The question does provide a key (1 face = 12 people), so this might not be seen as missing by many students.
- D: Other needs to say what flavor it is. This seems like a plausible omission since "Other" could encompass a wide range of flavors.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding what information is typically required for a graph or pictogram. They might not recognize the importance of knowing what "Other" refers to. 
  - A=40% (not knowing what typically should be included), B=20% (might think it's complete), C=10% (less likely to think about keys), D=30% (recognize "Other" is vague).

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple errors.
  - A=30%, B=25%, C=5%, D=40%.

- **Proficient:** These students understand the basics and are less likely to make careless mistakes. They might quickly identify that while a key is given, the specific question or a detailed description of "Other" could be considered missing.
  - A=20%, B=10%, C=5%, D=65%.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to critically evaluate the pictogram and its components. They might argue that while a lot of information is provided, the lack of specificity about the question or "Other" could be issues, but given the context, "Other" seems the most directly missing piece for clarity.
  - A=10%, B=5%, C=0%, D=85%.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
- **basic:** A=30% B=25% C=5% D=40%
- **proficient:** A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
- **advanced:** A=10% B=5% C=0% D=85%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=10% B=5% C=0% D=85%
