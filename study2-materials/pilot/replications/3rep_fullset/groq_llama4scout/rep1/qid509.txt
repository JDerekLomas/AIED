## Step 1: Understand the question
The question presents a quadratic equation in its factored form: \((h-8)(h+3)=0\), and one of the solutions is already given as \(h = -3\). The task is to find the other solution.

## 2: Solve the equation
To solve the equation \((h-8)(h+3)=0\), we apply the zero-product property, which states that if \(ab = 0\), then \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\). Therefore, \(h - 8 = 0\) or \(h + 3 = 0\), leading to \(h = 8\) or \(h = -3\).

## 3: Identify the correct answer
From the solutions obtained, \(h = 8\) or \(h = -3\), it's clear that the value that should replace the star is \(8\).

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions and student errors
- A common misconception could be that students might not fully understand the zero-product property or might make a mistake in solving for \(h\).
- However, given that one solution is provided (\(h = -3\)), and the equation is already factored, the question seems straightforward.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations or understanding the zero-product property. They might incorrectly solve for \(h\) or choose an answer based on misunderstanding the equation. Given the simplicity of the solutions (\(h=8\) or \(h=-3\)), and that \(h=-3\) is provided, there's a chance they might pick \(8\) if they understand the property but make calculation mistakes. However, confusion with the provided answer or not understanding how to derive the other root could lead to errors. So, \(A = 40\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 10\%\).

- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a better grasp of algebra but might still make careless mistakes. They are likely to understand the zero-product property and solve for \(h = 8\) correctly, given \(h = -3\) is shown. Thus, \(A = 80\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to solve the equation correctly without issues. The question seems straightforward to them, and they should easily identify \(h = 8\) as the other solution. So, \(A = 95\%\), \(B = 3\%\), \(C = 1\%\), \(D = 1\%\).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong understanding of algebra and should not make mistakes on such a straightforward question. They will easily solve for \(h = 8\). Hence, \(A = 99\%\), \(B = 0.5\%\), \(C = 0.3\%\), \(D = 0.2\%\).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.3% D=0.2%
