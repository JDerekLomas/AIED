To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The formula for the area of a triangle is given by \( A = \frac{1}{2}(b \times h) \), and the task is to rearrange this formula to solve for \( h \), the height of the triangle. This involves algebraic manipulation.

## Step 1: Understand the algebraic manipulation required
To make \( h \) the subject, we start with \( A = \frac{1}{2}(b \times h) \). Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: \( 2A = b \times h \). Then, divide both sides by \( b \) to isolate \( h \): \( h = \frac{2A}{b} \). This corresponds to option B.

## 2: Consider common misconceptions and errors
A common error might involve mishandling the algebra, such as forgetting to multiply or divide by 2 when rearranging the formula. For instance, not multiplying by 2 or incorrectly placing it, leading to \( h = \frac{1}{2}(b \times A) \) (option A) or \( h = \frac{A}{2b} \) (option C).

## 3: Analyze option A
Option A, \( h = \frac{1}{2}(b \times A) \), suggests a misunderstanding of the original formula and its rearrangement. It incorrectly keeps the \( \frac{1}{2} \) on the same side as \( b \) and \( A \) without properly isolating \( h \).

## 4: Analyze option C
Option C, \( h = \frac{A}{2b} \), indicates another algebraic error where the factor of 2 is incorrectly applied or omitted during the rearrangement process.

## 5: Consider the performance at different ability levels
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They could choose any option based on a lack of understanding of how to rearrange formulas. Expect a higher chance of selecting incorrect options due to fundamental algebraic errors.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebra but might still make careless mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the correct formula but could select incorrect options if they misunderstand the steps to isolate \( h \).

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid understanding of algebra and are likely to correctly rearrange the formula to find \( h = \frac{2A}{b} \). However, a small percentage might still make errors due to rushing or not checking their work.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have a very strong grasp of algebraic manipulations and are likely to almost universally choose the correct option, with very few errors.

## 6: Predict Percentages
Given the above analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (misinterpreting the formula), B=20% (correct but struggling), C=30% (another incorrect manipulation), D=20% (not understanding any option).
- **Basic:** A=15%, B=70%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** A=1%, B=98%, C=1%, D=0%.

The best answer is B.
