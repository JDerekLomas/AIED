## Step 1: Understanding the Sequence
The given sequence is 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ... which represents an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2.

## 2: Identifying the Pattern
To find the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, we use the formula \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\), where \(a_n\) is the nth term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(n\) is the term number, and \(d\) is the common difference. For this sequence, \(a_1 = 3\) and \(d = 2\).

## 3: Deriving the Formula for the nth Term
Substituting \(a_1 = 3\) and \(d = 2\) into the formula gives \(a_n = 3 + (n-1)2\). Simplifying this yields \(a_n = 3 + 2n - 2 = 2n + 1\).

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(2n\) would give 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ... which does not match the sequence.
- Option B: "Double, add 1" suggests \(2n + 1\), which matches our derived formula.
- Option C: \(2n + 1\) exactly matches the formula we derived.
- Option D: "Add 2 each time" describes the pattern but does not give a direct formula for the nth term.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to identify the pattern or formulate an expression. They might choose A or D because they seem simple or directly relate to observable changes in the sequence. Option C, being the correct formula, might be less likely chosen due to its algebraic nature. B might seem plausible but could be misunderstood. Guesses might be high here.
- **Basic**: Students here should recognize the sequence increases by 2 but might struggle with formulating \(2n + 1\). They might lean towards D as it describes the sequence's behavior but doesn't give a formula. A and B could be considered but might not be directly linked to the sequence's nth term formula.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily identify the sequence and derive or recognize \(2n + 1\). They are likely to choose C. Option B, while verbally describing \(2n + 1\), might also be considered. A and D are less likely as A doesn't fit and D doesn't provide a formula.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will quickly identify the sequence and its formula, \(2n + 1\), making C the most likely choice. They might also appreciate the verbal description in B but recognize C as the precise algebraic expression.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple but incorrect), B=20% (verbal cue), C=20% (correct but algebraic), D=30% (describes change but not formula).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=15%, C=60% (now more understandable), D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=5%, C=95%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
