To approach this question, let's first understand what a kite is in geometry. A kite is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal in length. This definition implies that a kite has one pair of opposite angles that are equal, and the diagonals intersect at right angles.

Now, let's consider the options given:

A) Square - A square has all sides of equal length and all angles are right angles. It fits the definition of a kite.

B) Rhombus - A rhombus has all sides of equal length, but not necessarily right angles. However, it does have pairs of adjacent sides that are equal, making it a kite.

C) Trapezium - A trapezium is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides but not necessarily equal adjacent sides. 

D) None of them are kites - This option requires that none of A, B, or C can be classified as a kite.

Given these definitions:

- A square (A) can definitely be classified as a kite because it meets the criteria (all sides are equal).
- A rhombus (B) can also be classified as a kite for the same reason.
- A trapezium (C) generally cannot be classified as a kite because it doesn't necessarily have two pairs of adjacent sides of equal length; it only guarantees one pair of parallel sides.

Let's predict the performance based on ability levels:

### below_basic
Students at this level may struggle with the definitions of the various quadrilaterals. They might confuse properties or not fully understand what makes a kite.
- A=40% (Some might recognize a square as a special case)
- B=30% (Might see rhombus as similar to square but not sure)
- C=20% (Could pick this thinking it's not a kite, but unsure)
- D=10% (Unlikely to understand the nuances)

### basic
Students at this level have a better grasp of basic geometric shapes but might still struggle with nuanced definitions.
- A=70% (Likely to know a square is a kite)
- B=60% (Likely to know a rhombus is a kite)
- C=10% (Understand trapezium isn't necessarily a kite)
- D=10% (Might think none are kites due to strict definitions)

### proficient
Students at this level understand the properties of geometric shapes well but need to apply them accurately.
- A=90% (Definitely a kite)
- B=85% (Definitely a kite)
- C=5% (Understand trapezium's general properties)
- D=0% (Understand that both square and rhombus can be kites)

### advanced
Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply properties with ease.
- A=100% (No doubt a square is a kite)
- B=100% (No doubt a rhombus is a kite)
- C=0% (Know trapezium isn't a kite by definition)
- D=0% (Know that both square and rhombus qualify)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=85% C=5% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=100% C=0% D=0%
