To solve this, let's first analyze the methods Tom and Katie use and determine their correctness.

Tom's method: He doubles \(59\) to get \(118\), and then doubles \(118\) to get \(236\). 
Mathematically, this can be represented as \(59 \times 2 \times 2 = 59 \times 4\), which is correct.

Katie's method: She calculates \(60 \times 4 = 240\) and then subtracts \(4\) to get \(236\).
Mathematically, this can be represented as \(60 \times 4 - 4 = (59 + 1) \times 4 - 4 = 59 \times 4 + 4 - 4 = 59 \times 4\), which is also correct.

Given that both methods are correct, the correct answer is \(C) Both Tom and Katie\).

Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication and have difficulties with mental math strategies. They might not fully understand the concepts or make errors in their calculations.
  - A: 20% (some might mistakenly think Tom's method is wrong)
  - B: 20% (similar reasoning for Katie)
  - C: 30% (a few might understand both methods are correct)
  - D: 30% (some might think neither is correct due to lack of understanding)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of math concepts but might still make simple errors.
  - A: 10% (less likely to think only Tom is correct)
  - B: 10% (similar for Katie)
  - C: 60% (most should understand both methods)
  - D: 20% (some might still be unsure)

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid understanding of math concepts and can apply them correctly.
  - A: 5% (very few would think only Tom is correct)
  - B: 5% (similar for Katie)
  - C: 85% (most understand both methods are correct)
  - D: 5% (unlikely to think neither is correct)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them in various contexts and explain their reasoning.
  - A: 0% (would not mistakenly limit it to Tom)
  - B: 0% (similar for Katie)
  - C: 95% (almost all understand both methods are correct)
  - D: 5% (very few, if any, would think neither is correct)

Therefore, the predictions are:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
