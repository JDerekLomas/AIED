To approach this question, let's analyze the potential difficulties and misconceptions related to counting backwards in steps of 4, starting from 24,993.

## Step 1: Understand the task
The task requires students to count backwards in steps of 4 from 24,993. The correct next number in the sequence would be 24,993 - 4 = 24,989.

## 2: Identify potential misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusion with the direction of counting (forwards vs. backwards) or errors in subtraction, particularly when dealing with large numbers or specific patterns. However, in this case, the operation is straightforward: subtracting 4.

## 3: Analyze the options
The options given are:
- A: 24,988
- B: 24,992
- C: 24,990
- D: 24,989

## 4: Evaluate the difficulty level
The question seems straightforward, but let's consider the levels of students:
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic subtraction or understanding the concept of counting backwards. They might choose A (24,988) because they subtract 5 instead of 4, or B (24,992) if they add 1 instead of subtracting 4.
- **Basic:** Students here should understand basic arithmetic operations. They might still make errors if they're not paying attention or if they miscalculate. Option C (24,990) could be a plausible mistake if a student thinks of subtracting 3 instead of 4.
- **Proficient:** These students should accurately perform the subtraction and choose D (24,989) as the correct answer. Mistakes at this level might be less common but could still occur due to carelessness.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to not only calculate correctly but also understand the pattern. They are less likely to make mistakes.

## 5: Predict student responses
Given the straightforward nature of the question:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (subtracting 5), B=20% (adding 1), C=20% (subtracting 3), D=30%
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=5%, C=15%, D=70%
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=2%, C=5%, D=88%
- **Advanced:** A=2%, B=1%, C=2%, D=95%

The best answer is D. 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=15% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=5% D=88%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95%
