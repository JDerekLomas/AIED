To approach this question, let's analyze the content and potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question requires students to understand symmetry, specifically reflection symmetry across a diagonal line. The figure provided is drawn in one half of a box with a red dotted line running diagonally across the box, indicating the line of symmetry. Students need to choose the image that completes the figure symmetrically.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task involves reflecting a given figure across a diagonal line of symmetry. This requires an understanding of geometric transformations, specifically reflection.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the line of symmetry or misunderstanding how reflection works across different types of lines (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). However, the provided question seems straightforward because it clearly indicates the line of symmetry (diagonal) and presents the figure in a simple, recognizable form.

## 3: Analyzing Options
- Option A, B, and D present incorrect reflections of the given figure.
- Option C presents a correct reflection of the given figure.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of symmetry or have difficulty visualizing the reflection across a diagonal line. They might choose an option randomly or based on a superficial understanding of what looks "right." Given the simplicity of the question and the clear indication of the line of symmetry, even students below the basic level might have a chance to get it right if they can visualize the reflection correctly. However, errors are likely due to a lack of understanding. **A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%**
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of geometry and might be able to recognize basic symmetries. However, they might still make errors if they misinterpret the line of symmetry or the reflection process. **A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%**
- **Proficient:** Students with a proficient understanding of geometry should easily recognize the correct reflection. They are less likely to make errors in identifying symmetry. **A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%**
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to have a deep understanding of geometric transformations, including reflections. They should have no trouble identifying the correct symmetric figure. **A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
