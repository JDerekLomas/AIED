## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question requires students to factorize the quadratic expression \(m^{2}+5m-14\) into the form \((m+a)(m+b)\) and then find the product of \(a\) and \(b\).

## 2: Identifying the factorization
To factorize \(m^{2}+5m-14\), we look for two numbers that add up to \(5\) and multiply to \(-14\). These numbers are \(7\) and \(-2\), because \(7 - 2 = 5\) and \(7 \times -2 = -14\). So, \(m^{2}+5m-14 = (m+7)(m-2)\).

## 3: Determining \(a\) and \(b\)
From the factorization \((m+7)(m-2)\), it's clear that \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

## 4: Calculating \(a \times b\)
The product of \(a\) and \(b\) is \(7 \times -2 = -14\).

## 5: Analyzing potential misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrectly factoring the quadratic or misinterpreting the relationship between the coefficients and the product of \(a\) and \(b\). However, the question directly asks for \(a \times b\), which is the constant term in the expanded form of \((m+a)(m+b) = m^2 + (a+b)m + ab\), implying \(ab = -14\).

## 6: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with factorization and understanding the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and the coefficients. They might incorrectly assume \(a \times b = 5\) (A) or \(a \times b = -5\) (B) due to confusion with the coefficient of \(m\), or they might choose \(C = 14\) (C) thinking the product is positive. \(D = -14\) (D) seems less likely as it requires understanding both the factorization and the correct product. Predicted percentages: A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a grasp of basic factorization. They might still make errors due to haste or misunderstanding, but \(D = -14\) should be the most appealing correct answer. Predicted percentages: A=10%, B=10%, C=20%, D=60%.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to factor the quadratic correctly and understand that \(a \times b\) equals the constant term in the expression, which is \(-14\). Predicted percentages: A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only factor correctly but also understand the implications of their factorization. They are likely to choose \(D = -14\) without issue. Predicted percentages: A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
