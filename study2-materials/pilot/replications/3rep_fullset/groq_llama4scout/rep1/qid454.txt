## Step 1: Understand the Function Machine
The function machine described takes an input, subtracts 1, then multiplies the result by 2, and the output of this process is 8.

## 2: Work Backwards to Find the Input
To find the input, we work backwards from the output. The output is 8, which is the result of multiplying the previous step's result by 2. So, before multiplying by 2, we had 8 / 2 = 4. Before getting 4, we had to subtract 1 from the input, meaning the input was 4 + 1 = 5.

## 3: Analyze the Question for Potential Misconceptions
The question tests the ability to work backwards through a function machine, which can sometimes catch students out if they are not careful with the order of operations. However, in this case, the operations are simple (subtract 1, then multiply by 2), and the numbers are easy to work with, reducing the likelihood of arithmetic errors.

## 4: Consider Student Errors
Students might make errors if they misunderstand the order of operations or if they incorrectly work backwards. For example, they might incorrectly calculate the step before multiplication as 8 - 2 = 6 (ignoring the multiplication by 2), and then add 1 to get 7, or directly try to solve it without properly reversing the operations.

## 5: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic arithmetic and reversing the operations. They might not correctly work backwards or might make simple arithmetic mistakes. Option A (15) seems too high to be a simple mistake, suggesting a calculation error. Option D (4.5) could result from incorrectly solving the equation (e.g., \(2(x-1) = 8\) leads to \(x - 1 = 4\), then \(x = 5\), but if they solve \(x - 1 = 8 / 2\) incorrectly or skip steps, they might get 4.5). Let's assume B (5) is the correct answer, so errors could be A=30% (guessing or large calculation mistake), B=40% (got it right), C=20% (another mistake), D=10% (smaller calculation mistake).

- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to handle simple equations and work backwards through the function machine with some accuracy. They might still make some arithmetic mistakes but should have a good grasp of the concepts. So, B=70%, A=15%, C=10%, D=5%.

- **Proficient:** These students should easily work through the problem with minimal errors, accurately reversing the operations. So, B=90%, A=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only get the correct answer easily but also understand the process thoroughly, minimizing errors. So, B=95%, A=2%, C=2%, D=1%.

## 6: Provide the Predictions in the Required Format
Given the steps above, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
