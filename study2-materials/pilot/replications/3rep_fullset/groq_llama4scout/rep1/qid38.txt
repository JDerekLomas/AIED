## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question asks students to add two fractions and simplify the result: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \). This requires finding a common denominator and then adding the fractions.

## 2: Identify the Common Misconception
A common misconception when adding fractions is failing to find a common denominator or incorrectly handling the signs and operations. However, in this case, the fractions can be easily made to have a common denominator by realizing that \( \frac{4}{x} \) can be written as \( \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{8}{2x} \).

## 3: Solve the Problem
To add \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \), convert \( \frac{4}{x} \) to have a denominator of \( 2x \): \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \).

## 4: Analyze the Options
- A: \( \frac{11}{2x} \) - This is the correct answer.
- B: \( \frac{7}{3x} \) - Incorrect, as the common denominator is \( 2x \), not \( 3x \), and the numerator is incorrect.
- C: \( \frac{11}{x} \) - Incorrect, as it suggests the common denominator is \( x \), not \( 2x \).
- D: \( \frac{7}{2x} \) - Incorrect, as the numerator is incorrect.

## 5: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with finding a common denominator or adding fractions. They might not even attempt to find a common denominator or might add the numerators and denominators separately. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, particularly those that don't properly account for the denominators or numerators. \( A = 10\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 40\% \), \( D = 20\% \).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic fraction operations but might still make simple mistakes. They are more likely to attempt finding a common denominator but might make calculation errors. \( A = 50\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 10\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students understand fraction operations well and are likely to get the correct answer but might occasionally make a slip. \( A = 80\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and fractions. They are very likely to get the question correct with minimal chance of error. \( A = 95\% \), \( B = 3\% \), \( C = 1\% \), \( D = 1\% \).
