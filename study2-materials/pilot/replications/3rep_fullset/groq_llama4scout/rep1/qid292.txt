To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \frac{1}{3} \times(-6)= \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question requires the multiplication of a fraction by a negative integer. A common misconception in multiplication involving negative numbers is forgetting to apply the rule for multiplying by a negative number (i.e., two negatives make a positive, a negative and a positive make a negative). For fractions, students also need to remember to multiply the numerators and denominators appropriately.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Answer
The correct calculation is \( \frac{1}{3} \times (-6) = \frac{1 \times (-6)}{3} = \frac{-6}{3} = -2 \). So, the correct answer is C) \( -2 \).

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
- A common error could be ignoring the negative sign, leading to \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \), but since the question involves a negative, this might not be the most prevalent mistake here.
- Another error could be misunderstanding the fraction multiplication, leading to \( \frac{1}{3} \times (-6) = \frac{1}{-18} = -\frac{1}{18} \) (option D), which would be a mistake in applying the multiplication rule for fractions.
- Option B, \( -\frac{6}{18} \), simplifies to \( -\frac{1}{3} \), which could result from a miscalculation or incorrect simplification.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication and the concept of negative numbers. They might incorrectly apply operations or forget to consider the negative sign, potentially leading to a higher chance of selecting incorrect options due to a lack of understanding. 
  - A: \( 20\% \) (guessing or incorrect calculation)
  - B: \( 15\% \) (misunderstanding of fractions)
  - C: \( 40\% \) (some understanding but might still make basic errors)
  - D: \( 25\% \) (confusion with fraction and negative number multiplication)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple errors, especially with negative numbers and fractions.
  - A: \( 10\% \) (basic arithmetic mistake)
  - B: \( 10\% \) (fraction simplification error)
  - C: \( 60\% \) (correct application of rules)
  - D: \( 20\% \) (fraction and negative multiplication confusion)

- **Proficient:** These students should have a solid grasp of fractions, negative numbers, and their multiplication.
  - A: \( 5\% \) (rare mistake, possibly due to rushing)
  - B: \( 5\% \) (uncommon error in simplification)
  - C: \( 80\% \) (correct application of mathematical rules)
  - D: \( 10\% \) (occasional lapse in understanding)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have a deep understanding and apply mathematical concepts accurately.
  - A: \( 2\% \) (very rare mistake)
  - B: \( 2\% \) (rare error, possibly due to distraction)
  - C: \( 90\% \) (confident and correct application)
  - D: \( 6\% \) (extremely rare confusion)
