To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "What is \( 5.5 \% \) of \( 400 \) ?", let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls or ease of calculation.

The question requires converting a percentage to a decimal and then multiplying by a number. \( 5.5 \% = 0.055 \), and \( 0.055 \times 400 = 22 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculation
The correct calculation is straightforward: \( 5.5 \% \) of \( 400 = 0.055 \times 400 = 22 \). This means the correct answer is A) \( 22 \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve incorrect conversion of the percentage to a decimal or misunderstanding the operation (e.g., adding or subtracting instead of multiplying). For instance, some might calculate \( 5.5 \times 400 \) (which equals \( 2200 \)) or mistakenly think \( 5.5 \% \) is \( 0.55 \), leading to \( 0.55 \times 400 = 220 \).

## 3: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \( 22 \) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \( 11 \) could result from a miscalculation, such as \( 0.0275 \times 400 \) (if mistakenly using \( 2.75 \% \) or another incorrect percentage).
- Option C: \( 5.5 \) might be chosen by those who misunderstand the concept of percentage or simply take \( 5.5 \) as is without calculation.
- Option D: \( 220 \) could result from using \( 0.55 \) instead of \( 0.055 \) (thinking \( 5.5 \% = 55 \% \) or similar mistake).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with percentage calculations and decimal conversions. They might choose C (\( 5.5 \)) because they don't understand the calculation, or D (\( 220 \)) if they incorrectly convert \( 5.5 \% \) to \( 55 \% \). A and B are less likely but could be considered if they've had some exposure to correct methods.
- **Basic**: Students here might still make errors in conversion or calculation. Option D (\( 220 \)) is a plausible mistake if they use \( 55 \% \) of \( 400 \) instead. Option B (\( 11 \)) could also be a guess without proper calculation.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to understand percentages and decimal conversions well. They should predominantly choose A (\( 22 \)), with a few possible errors, particularly with D (\( 220 \)) if they misread or miscalculate.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly likely to choose A (\( 22 \)) correctly, with very few errors.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (if they understand it's a calculation and not just \( 5.5 \)), B=10%, C=30% ( direct selection without calculation), D=40% (incorrect conversion).
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=15%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=5%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
