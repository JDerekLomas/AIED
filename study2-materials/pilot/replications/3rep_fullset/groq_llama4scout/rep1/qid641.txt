## Step 1: Understand the question
The question tests students' understanding of common factors in algebraic expressions. Tom claims that 4 is a common factor of \(6x\) and \(9y^2\), while Katie claims that \(y\) is a common factor of \(6x\) and \(9y^2\). We need to assess the validity of each claim.

## 2: Analyze Tom's claim
For Tom to be correct, 4 must be a factor of both \(6x\) and \(9y^2\). The factors of \(6x\) are \(1, 2, 3, 6, x, 2x, 3x, 6x\) and the factors of \(9y^2\) are \(1, 3, 9, y, y^2, 3y, 3y^2, 9y, 9y^2\). For 4 to be a common factor, both expressions must be divisible by 4. However, \(6x\) is not necessarily divisible by 4 unless \(x\) is an even number, and \(9y^2\) is not divisible by 4 regardless of \(y\)'s value because 9 is not divisible by 4. Thus, Tom's claim is not universally true.

## 3: Analyze Katie's claim
For Katie to be correct, \(y\) must be a common factor of \(6x\) and \(9y^2\). \(6x\) does not have \(y\) as a factor (unless \(x\) has \(y\) in it, which is not indicated), but \(9y^2\) clearly has \(y\) as a factor. Therefore, \(y\) cannot be a common factor of both expressions unless \(x\) also contains \(y\), which is not specified. Thus, Katie's claim is not universally true based on the information given.

## 4: Detailed analysis of Tom's claim
Given \(6x = 2 \times 3 \times x\) and \(9y^2 = 3^2 \times y^2\), for 4 (\(2^2\)) to be a factor, \(x\) must include at least \(2^2\) (or 4) as a factor for \(6x\), and there's no \(2^2\) inherently in \(9y^2\). So, Tom is incorrect without specific conditions on \(x\).

## 5: Detailed analysis of Katie's claim
\(6x\) does not inherently contain \(y\), and \(9y^2\) does contain \(y\). For \(y\) to be a common factor, both must have \(y\), which is not the case here since \(6x\) does not necessarily contain \(y\). So, Katie is incorrect based on the given expressions.

## 6: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic factor understanding. They might incorrectly assume Tom is right because 4 seems like it could be a factor if \(x\) or \(y\) has it, or they might not understand what a common factor means. Katie might seem right if they think \(y\) could be in \(x\). So, A=30% (thinking 4 could be a factor if \(x\) is right), B=20% (thinking \(y\) must be in \(x\)), C=10% (not understanding common factors well), D=40% (completely unsure or understanding it's not straightforward).
- **Basic**: At this level, students understand factors but might not apply it well to algebraic expressions. They might see Tom as incorrect because \(6x\) isn't obviously divisible by 4, and Katie as incorrect because \(y\) isn't in \(6x\). So, A=20%, B=20%, C=10%, D=50%.
- **Proficient**: Students here understand factors and can apply them to simple algebraic expressions. They'd see Tom's claim as potentially wrong without \(x\) being a multiple of 2, and Katie's as wrong because \(y\) isn't a factor of \(6x\). So, A=10%, B=10%, C=5%, D=75%.
- **Advanced**: These students can handle algebraic expressions confidently. They'll quickly see Tom and Katie are making claims based on assumptions about \(x\) and \(y\), and neither is universally correct. So, A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.

## 7: Finalizing predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
- **basic**: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
- **proficient**: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
- **advanced**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
