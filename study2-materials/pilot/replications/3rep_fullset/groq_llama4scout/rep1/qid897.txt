## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation provided is \(y = x^2\). The task is to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = -9\).

## 2: Calculate the correct value of \(y\)
To find \(y\), we substitute \(x = -9\) into the equation \(y = x^2\). Thus, \(y = (-9)^2 = 81\).

## 3: Analyze potential misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect handling of negative numbers in exponentiation, such as thinking \((-9)^2 = -81\) or \((-9)^2 = -9\).

## 4: Evaluate the difficulty of the question for different ability levels
- For students below the basic level, there might be confusion about how to handle the negative sign and the squaring operation, potentially leading to incorrect answers like \(-81\) or \(-18\).
- For basic-level students, the concept of squaring a number and the effect of a negative sign when squared should be somewhat familiar, but they might still make errors, especially if they misinterpret the operation.
- Proficient students should understand that squaring a negative number results in a positive number, thus \((-9)^2 = 81\).
- Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of algebraic operations and should easily identify the correct answer.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
### Below Basic
- A: \(-18\) might seem plausible if students incorrectly think of multiplication rather than squaring, or mistakenly apply an operation that results in \(-18\), but it's less likely as a direct result of squaring \(-9\). (10%)
- B: \(-9\) could be chosen if students misunderstand the squaring operation. (20%)
- C: \(81\) is the correct answer. (20%)
- D: \(-81\) could be chosen due to mistakenly believing \((-9)^2 = -81\). (50%)

### Basic
- A: \(-18\) (5%)
- B: \(-9\) (10%)
- C: \(81\) (70%)
- D: \(-81\) (15%)

### Proficient
- A: \(-18\) (2%)
- B: \(-9\) (2%)
- C: \(81\) (90%)
- D: \(-81\) (6%)

### Advanced
- A: \(-18\) (1%)
- B: \(-9\) (0%)
- C: \(81\) (95%)
- D: \(-81\) (4%)
