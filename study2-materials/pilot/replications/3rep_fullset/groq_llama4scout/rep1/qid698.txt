To solve this, let's consider how students at different ability levels might approach the question.

The question asks for the probability of getting a 1 on both spinners. The first spinner has numbers 1-4, and the second spinner has numbers 1-5. 

## Step 1: Calculate the probability of getting a 1 on each spinner
The probability of getting a 1 on the first spinner is \( \frac{1}{4} \) because there is 1 favorable outcome (spinning a 1) out of 4 possible outcomes (spinning a 1, 2, 3, or 4). The probability of getting a 1 on the second spinner is \( \frac{1}{5} \) because there is 1 favorable outcome (spinning a 1) out of 5 possible outcomes (spinning a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).

## 2: Calculate the combined probability
Since the spinners are independent, the probability of getting a 1 on both spinners is the product of the probabilities of getting a 1 on each spinner: \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{20} \).

## 3: Evaluate the answer choices
- A: \( \frac{1}{9} \)
- B: \( \frac{1}{20} \)
- C: \( \frac{2}{9} \)
- D: \( \frac{2}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \)

The correct answer is B: \( \frac{1}{20} \).

## 4: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with calculating probabilities or multiplying fractions. They might not correctly calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{5} \) or might confuse the number of outcomes for each spinner. They could choose any option randomly or based on misconceptions. However, some might guess B if they recall basic probability concepts but apply them incorrectly. \( A=30\% B=40\% C=15\% D=15\% \)

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic probability concepts. They might make simple calculation errors or misunderstand the independence of events but are more likely to attempt the correct calculation. \( A=20\% B=60\% C=10\% D=10\% \)

- **Proficient:** These students understand probability well and can calculate it for independent events. They are less likely to make mistakes in calculation but might still choose incorrect options if they misinterpret the question. \( A=5\% B=80\% C=5\% D=10\% \)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of probability concepts, including independence and multiplication of probabilities. They are highly likely to choose the correct answer. \( A=0\% B=95\% C=0\% D=5\% \)

The best answer is B. 

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
