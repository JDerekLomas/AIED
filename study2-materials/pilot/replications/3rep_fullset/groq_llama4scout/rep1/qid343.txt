To approach this question, let's consider the properties of the shape formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of a given quadrilateral.

## Step 1: Understanding the Property
When the midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral are joined, the resulting shape is always a parallelogram. This is a known property in geometry and can be proven by using the midpoint theorem, which states that the segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half as long.

## 2: Applying the Property to the Question
Given that the original shape is an irregular quadrilateral, joining the midpoints of its sides will result in a parallelogram. This property does not depend on the specific type of quadrilateral (e.g., rectangle, rhombus, square, or irregular quadrilateral); the resulting figure is always a parallelogram.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: Parallelogram. This is the correct answer based on the geometric property mentioned.
- B: Rhombus. A rhombus is a special type of parallelogram where all sides are of equal length. This is not necessarily true for all quadrilaterals' midpoint-connected shapes.
- C: Kite. A kite is a type of quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal. This does not apply to the shape formed by joining midpoints.
- D: Rectangle. A rectangle is a special type of parallelogram with right angles. This is not necessarily true for all quadrilaterals' midpoint-connected shapes.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand geometric properties or might not recognize the shape formed by joining midpoints. They might guess or choose based on visual inspection rather than geometric principles. Hence, A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of shapes but might not recall the specific property. They might lean towards more familiar shapes or guess. Thus, A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Students here should know the property that joining midpoints forms a parallelogram. They might be less likely to choose specific types of parallelograms unless they can visually confirm it. So, A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students not only know the property but can also apply it accurately. They understand that without more specific information about the quadrilateral (like right angles or side lengths), the shape will be a parallelogram. Hence, A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
