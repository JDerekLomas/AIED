## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to solve a system of linear equations to find the value of \( l \). The equations given are:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
2l + 3m = 13 \\
3l + 4m = 17
\end{array}
\]
This requires students to use either substitution or elimination method to solve for \( l \) and \( m \).

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
The question seems straightforward but let's consider potential misconceptions or difficulties. A common issue could be in solving the equations correctly, especially if students are not careful with the signs or the operations during the elimination or substitution process.

## 3: Analyzing the Difficulty Level
The difficulty of this question can be considered moderate. It requires students to have a basic understanding of solving simultaneous equations, which is typically covered in the early stages of algebra in GCSE mathematics.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebra and solving equations. They might not know how to approach solving simultaneous equations or might make significant errors in calculation. Given the nature of the question, it's likely that a significant portion would choose incorrectly, but let's assume they might be drawn to simple or whole number solutions. Option C (\( l = 1 \)) seems like a plausible simple solution that might attract some.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors, especially if they rush or don't check their work. They are more likely to attempt a solution but might struggle with the arithmetic or choosing the correct method.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to solve the equations accurately using either the substitution or elimination method. They should be able to find \( l \) and \( m \) correctly.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to solve the problem quickly and accurately, possibly using the elimination method efficiently.

## 5: Solving the Equations for Reference
To solve these equations, let's use the elimination method:
Multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 gives:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
8l + 12m = 52 \\
9l + 12m = 51
\end{array}
\]
Subtracting the first new equation from the second gives:
\[
l = -1
\]
So, the correct answer is \( l = -1 \), which corresponds to option A.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
Given the solution \( l = -1 \):
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (since they might guess or have no idea), B=20%, C=30% (a simple positive solution), D=30%.
- **Basic**: A=60% (correct, but let's adjust for reality), B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=80% (most should get it right), B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=95% (very high accuracy), B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

## 7: Adjusting Estimates
Adjusting for a more realistic scenario where most students, even at lower levels, might have some exposure to solving simultaneous equations:
- **Below Basic**: A=10%, B=15%, C=35%, D=40%.
- **Basic**: A=40%, B=25%, C=15%, D=20%.
- **Proficient**: A=70%, B=15%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=35% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
