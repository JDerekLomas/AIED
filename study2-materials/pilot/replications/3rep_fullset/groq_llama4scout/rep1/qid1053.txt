To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question on factorizing the quadratic expression \(x^{2} - x - 6\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The expression \(x^{2} - x - 6\) can be factorized by finding two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to -1. These numbers are -3 and 2, because \( -3 \times 2 = -6 \) and \( -3 + 2 = -1 \). Therefore, the correct factorization is \( (x - 3)(x + 2) \), which corresponds to option A.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
Students might make errors due to misconceptions about factorization, such as incorrectly identifying the numbers that multiply to the constant term and add to the coefficient of the linear term.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( (x - 3)(x - 2) \), suggests numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5, not fitting the given quadratic.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( (x + 3)(x + 2) \), suggests numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5, which does not match.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( (x + 3)(x - 2) \), suggests numbers that multiply to -6 and add to 1, which is incorrect for this expression.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and factorizations. They might randomly select an option or choose based on superficial patterns. Given the simplicity of the numbers involved, some might still stumble upon the correct answer by trial and error or intuition. However, errors are likely across the board. 
  - A (correct) might be chosen by 20% due to chance or very basic understanding.
  - B, C, and D could each be around 26-27% due to guessing or systematic errors.

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might not always apply it correctly, especially under time pressure or with less familiar expressions. The correct numbers (-3 and 2) are relatively easy to identify for those with a solid grasp of basic factorization.
  - A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%

- **Proficient:** These students have a good understanding of algebraic techniques, including factorization. They should easily identify the correct factors.
  - A=85%, B=10%, C=3%, D=2%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand how to factorize but also can apply more complex algebraic concepts. They are highly likely to choose the correct option.
  - A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%

Given these considerations, here are the predictions:

below_basic: A=20% B=26% C=27% D=27%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
