To approach this question, let's first understand the patterns and the methods Jo and Paul use to calculate the number of squares in Pattern 15.

## Step 1: Understanding the Pattern
The pattern consists of a rectangle with a height of 3 squares and a width that increases by 1 for each subsequent pattern, plus 2 additional squares, one on each side of the middle row of the rectangle.

## 2: General Formula for the Pattern
For Pattern \(n\), the number of squares can be calculated as:
- The rectangle part: \(3 \times (n + 2)\) because the width starts at 3 (for Pattern 1) and increases by 1 for each pattern.
- The 2 extra squares.

## 3: Adjusting the Formula for Pattern \(n\)
So, the total number of squares in Pattern \(n\) can be represented as:
\[3 \times (n + 2) - 4\]
or 
\[3n + 6 - 4 = 3n + 2\]

However, let's derive it directly from given patterns:
- Pattern 3: \(3 \times 3 + 2 = 11\)
- Pattern 4: \(3 \times 4 + 2 = 14\)

## 4: Applying to Pattern 15
Using the observed pattern:
- For Pattern \(n\), the formula seems to be \(3n + 2\).

## 5: Evaluating Jo's Method
Jo does: \(15 \times 3 + 4 = 45 + 4 = 49\)

## 6: Evaluating Paul's Method
Paul does: \((15 + 2) \times 3 - 4 = 17 \times 3 - 4 = 51 - 4 = 47\)

## 7: Correct Formula Application
The correct calculation based on observed patterns (or a general formula if directly inferred) for Pattern 15 should be:
\[3 \times 15 + 2 = 45 + 2 = 47\]

## 8: Comparing Methods
- Jo's method yields 49.
- Paul's method yields 47.
- The correct count is 47.

## 9: Determining Correctness
- Jo is incorrect because \(15 \times 3 + 4 = 49\), not 47.
- Paul is correct because \((15 + 2) \times 3 - 4 = 17 \times 3 - 4 = 51 - 4 = 47\), which matches the correct count.

## 10: Predicting Student Responses
Given this, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with algebraic expressions and pattern recognition. They might not understand either method correctly.
  - A: Only Jo: 30% (some might mistakenly think Jo's simpler calculation is correct)
  - B: Only Paul: 20% (if they understand Paul's method but not Jo's)
  - C: Both Jo and Paul: 10% (unlikely, as they'd need to see both as viable)
  - D: Neither is correct: 40% (not understanding either)

- **Basic**: Students have a foundational understanding but may make calculation errors.
  - A: Only Jo: 25%
  - B: Only Paul: 40% (as they might correctly identify Paul's method)
  - C: Both Jo and Paul: 5%
  - D: Neither is correct: 30%

- **Proficient**: Students understand the pattern and can apply formulas.
  - A: Only Jo: 10%
  - B: Only Paul: 60% (correctly identifying Paul's method as right)
  - C: Both Jo and Paul: 5%
  - D: Neither is correct: 25%

- **Advanced**: Students can not only apply formulas but also evaluate their correctness efficiently.
  - A: Only Jo: 5%
  - B: Only Paul: 80%
  - C: Both Jo and Paul: 0%
  - D: Neither is correct: 15%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=0% D=15%
