## Step 1: Understand the question and the ratio
The question involves sharing sweets between Jess and Heena in a ratio of \( 3:5 \). Jess gets \( 15 \) sweets, and we need to find out how many sweets Heena gets.

## 2: Calculate Heena's sweets using the ratio
Given the ratio \( 3:5 \), let's denote the multiplier as \( x \). So, Jess gets \( 3x \) sweets and Heena gets \( 5x \) sweets. Since Jess gets \( 15 \) sweets, we have \( 3x = 15 \), which means \( x = 5 \). Therefore, Heena gets \( 5x = 5 \times 5 = 25 \) sweets.

## 3: Analyze the potential for misconception
A common misconception could be adding or subtracting parts of the ratio directly to find the other person's share or not using the ratio correctly. However, this question is straightforward because once students identify \( 3x = 15 \), they can easily find \( x \) and then Heena's share.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with setting up the equation from the ratio or understanding how to use \( x \) to find Heena's share. They might guess or try to add/subtract the ratio parts directly. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, possibly with B or C being tempting if they misunderstand the ratio or calculation.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to set up a simple equation and solve for \( x \), then find Heena's share. However, there might still be some confusion or miscalculation, leading to some incorrect answers, possibly A or B.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve for \( x \) and find Heena's share correctly. They understand ratios and can apply them to find missing parts. Expect a high percentage to choose D.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand ratios but can also apply them quickly and accurately. They are less likely to make mistakes and will easily identify D as the correct answer.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (random guess), B=30% (misunderstanding of ratio), C=20% (thinking one part is the answer), D=30% (some might get it right by chance or correct calculation).
- **Basic**: A=10% (occasional miscalculation), B=5% (simple error), C=5% (misinterpretation), D=80% (most get it right).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (rare mistake), B=2% (simple calculation error), C=2% (misunderstanding), D=91% (accurate calculation).
- **Advanced**: A=1% (very rare mistake), B=1% (error in calculation), C=1% (misinterpretation), D=97% (almost all get it right).

## 6: Convert estimates to requested format
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **below_basic**: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
- **basic**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **proficient**: A=2% B=2% C=2% D=94%
- **advanced**: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=2% D=94%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%
