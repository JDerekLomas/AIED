## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question presents a sequence of operations performed on a number \(n\): subtract 5, divide by 8, add 4, and finally multiply by 7. It then provides two expressions representing these operations as described by Jo and Paul. The task is to determine who is correct.

## 2: Translate the Operations into Mathematical Expressions
The operations in order are: \(n - 5\), then \(\frac{n-5}{8}\), next \(\frac{n-5}{8} + 4\), and finally \(7\left(\frac{n-5}{8} + 4\right)\).

## 3: Analyze Jo's Expression
Jo's expression is \(7\left(\frac{(n-5)}{8}+4\right)\). This directly matches the step-by-step translation of the operations given, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 4: Analyze Paul's Expression
Paul's expression is \(7((n-5) \div 8)+4\). According to the order of operations, this translates to \(7\left(\frac{n-5}{8}\right) + 4\), not \(7\left(\frac{n-5}{8} + 4\right)\). Paul's expression does not correctly represent the sequence of operations as it misses the addition of 4 before multiplying by 7.

## 5: Determine the Correctness of Jo and Paul
Jo is correct because her expression accurately represents the given sequence of operations. Paul is incorrect because his expression suggests adding 4 after multiplying by 7, which is not what the problem states.

## 6: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with understanding the sequence of operations or translating them into algebraic expressions. They might not fully grasp the order of operations or how to represent the steps algebraically. Thus, they could be more likely to choose incorrect options due to confusion.
  - A (Only Jo) = 20%, B (Only Paul) = 20%, C (Both Jo and Paul) = 30%, D (Neither is correct) = 30%
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to misunderstanding the application of the order of operations or misinterpreting the expressions.
  - A = 60%, B = 20%, C = 10%, D = 10%
- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of algebraic expressions and the order of operations. They should be able to accurately assess Jo's and Paul's expressions.
  - A = 80%, B = 5%, C = 10%, D = 5%
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand but can also clearly articulate and apply their knowledge. They are less likely to make errors.
  - A = 90%, B = 0%, C = 5%, D = 5%
