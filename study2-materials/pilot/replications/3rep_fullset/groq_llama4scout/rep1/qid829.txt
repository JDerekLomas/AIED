## Step 1: Understand the task
We need to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for the given algebraic question.

## 2: Identify the algebraic process
The question requires multiplying out the brackets: \((m-3)(m-2)\). The correct process involves using the FOIL method: First, Outer, Inner, Last. This means multiplying the first terms in each bracket, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms in each bracket, and then adding them all together.

## 3: Apply the FOIL method
Applying FOIL: \(m \times m + m \times -2 - 3 \times m - 3 \times -2\), which simplifies to \(m^2 - 2m - 3m + 6\), and further to \(m^2 - 5m + 6\).

## 4: Analyze the options
- A: \(m^2 - 5m + 6\) (Correct answer)
- B: \(m^2 - m - 6\)
- C: \(m^2 + 5m + 6\)
- D: \(m^2 - 5m - 6\)

## 5: Consider common misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect application of signs or incorrect multiplication. However, given that the question is straightforward and the numbers are small and manageable, the likelihood of error depends on the student's familiarity with the FOIL method and their attention to detail.

## 6: Assess difficulty by ability level
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the FOIL method or with handling negative numbers. They might incorrectly add or subtract terms or mishandle signs.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes or not fully understand the distribution of negative signs.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the FOIL method well and are less likely to make errors in simple expansions.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and are unlikely to make mistakes.

## 7: Predict responses
Given the simplicity of the question and assuming most students have been taught the FOIL method:
- **Below_basic**: A=40% (some get it right by chance or basic understanding), B=20% (common mistake), C=20% (another common mistake), D=20% (error in calculation).
- **Basic**: A=70% (most get it right with some understanding), B=15% (careless mistake), C=10% (less common error), D=5% (unlikely but possible mistake).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (strong understanding, few mistakes), B=5% (minor error), C=3% (rare mistake), D=2% (very unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (very confident), B=3% (occasional lapse), C=1% (rare), D=1% (extremely rare).

## 8: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
