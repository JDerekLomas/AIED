To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question asks students to add two fractions: \( \frac{3}{10} + \frac{5}{10} \) and to write the answer in its simplest form. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The fractions have the same denominator, which makes the addition straightforward: \( \frac{3}{10} + \frac{5}{10} = \frac{3+5}{10} = \frac{8}{10} \). Simplifying \( \frac{8}{10} \) gives \( \frac{4}{5} \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors
- A common error might be adding the numerators and denominators separately or not simplifying the fraction.
- Option A (\( \frac{8}{20} \)) could be chosen by students who do not simplify their fraction correctly after adding, as \( \frac{8}{10} \) can be incorrectly manipulated or not fully simplified.
- Option B (\( \frac{8}{10} \)) might be chosen by students who add the fractions correctly but forget to simplify.
- Option D (\( \frac{4}{10} \)) could be a result of incorrect simplification or calculation.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- The correct answer is \( \frac{4}{5} \) (Option C), which requires the student to both add the fractions and simplify the result.
- Option A (\( \frac{8}{20} \)) is essentially \( \frac{4}{10} \) or \( \frac{2}{5} \) when simplified, but presented in a non-simplified form similar to the incorrect addition result.
- Option B (\( \frac{8}{10} \)) is correct before simplification to \( \frac{4}{5} \).
- Option D (\( \frac{4}{10} \)) simplifies to \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is not the result of the given addition.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with adding fractions and simplifying. They might choose A (20%), B (30%), or D (30%) due to not fully understanding fraction addition or simplification, with C (20%) being the correct answer but potentially challenging.
- **Basic:** At this level, students understand basic fraction operations. They might still make errors in simplification: A (10%), B (40%) because they get the addition right but might not always simplify, D (10%), and C (40%).
- **Proficient:** Students here are expected to handle fraction addition and simplification well. Thus, A (5%), B (20%) because they might not always remember to simplify or might make a minor error, and C (75%) as the correct and expected response.
- **Advanced:** These students are highly confident in their fraction skills. Hence, A (0%), B (5%), D (0%), and C (95%).

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic:** A=10% B=40% C=40% D=10%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=20% C=75% D=0%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=20% C=75% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
