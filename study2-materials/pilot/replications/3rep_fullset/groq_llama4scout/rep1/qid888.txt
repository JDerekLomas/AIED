## Step 1: Understand the question and the content it tests
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\), which involves applying the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials). The correct expansion is \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 2: Identify common misconceptions or errors
A common error in expanding brackets is incorrectly handling the signs of the terms within the brackets or mistakenly adding instead of multiplying the terms. For the expression given, a frequent mistake might involve incorrect signs or failing to distribute correctly.

## 3: Analyze option A - \( m^{2}-2 m-35 \)
This option suggests a misunderstanding in the multiplication process, likely resulting from incorrect application of the FOIL method or simple arithmetic mistakes.

## 4: Analyze option B - \( m^{2}-12 m+35 \)
This is the correct answer. Students who understand and correctly apply the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) will arrive at this solution.

## 5: Analyze option C - \( m^{2}+12 m+35 \)
This option suggests that a student incorrectly added the middle terms or misunderstood the signs, leading to a positive coefficient for \(m\).

## 6: Analyze option D - \( m^{2}-12 m-35 \)
This option implies a mistake in the constant term, suggesting the student forgot to change the sign of one of the terms when multiplying.

## 7: Consider student ability levels and predicted errors
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly apply the FOIL method or make simple arithmetic errors. Option A and D seem plausible as incorrect answers due to simple mistakes.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to lack of practice or misunderstanding of the FOIL method. They are less likely to choose option C, as it requires a significant misunderstanding of the operation.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic techniques, including expanding brackets. They are likely to choose the correct option B but might still make occasional errors leading to options A or D.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less likely to make errors. However, even advanced students can have off days or overlook details.

## 8: Predict percentages for each ability level
Given the nature of the question and common errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple mistake), B=40% (some understanding but could be guessing), C=10% (unlikely), D=20% (another type of simple mistake).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=60%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=90%, C=2%, D=3%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
