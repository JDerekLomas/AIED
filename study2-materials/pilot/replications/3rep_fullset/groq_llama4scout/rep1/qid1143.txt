To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question involves a circle intersected by curves at 5 equally spaced intervals about its circumference. The task is to determine which regular polygon could be constructed by continuing to join up the intersections of the curves with straight lines.

## Step 1: Understanding the Basics
The curves intersecting the circle create points of intersection. If these points are joined with straight lines, the shape formed depends on the number and spacing of these intersection points.

## 2: Identifying Key Concepts
A regular polygon has equal sides and equal angles. The number of sides of a regular polygon is determined by the number of vertices (or intersection points in this context) it has.

## 3: Analyzing the Given Information
The question mentions intersections at 5 equally spaced intervals. This implies that there are 5 points around the circle where the curves intersect it.

## 4: Relating to Polygon Construction
Joining these 5 points with straight lines would form a polygon. Since the points are equally spaced around the circumference of the circle, the polygon formed would be regular.

## 5: Determining the Polygon
With 5 equally spaced points, the polygon that can be constructed by joining these points is a pentagon, which has 5 sides.

## 6: Evaluating the Options
- A: An octagon has 8 sides.
- B: A hexagon has 6 sides.
- C: A pentagon has 5 sides.
- D: A circle is not a polygon but a continuous curved shape.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle to understand the relationship between the number of intersection points and the polygon formed. They might choose based on superficial understanding or guesswork. Expect a spread across options but potentially with a higher chance of incorrect choices like A or B.
- **Basic**: Students here might have a better grasp of basic geometric shapes but could still be confused by the specifics of the question. They might lean towards C but could also consider other options based on misunderstanding the construction process.
- **Proficient**: These students should understand that joining 5 points creates a pentagon. They are less likely to choose A, B, or D.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level would likely have a strong understanding of geometric constructions and the properties of polygons. They would easily recognize that only a pentagon matches the description.

## 8: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The best answer is C.
