To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding that students might have.

The question involves solving a simple linear equation and evaluating the correctness of two proposed steps in the solution process.

## Step 1: Understanding the Equation and Proposed Steps
The given equation is \(\frac{3x}{2} + 1 = 1.6\). To assess Tom's and Katie's steps:
- Tom suggests \(\frac{3x}{2} = 0.6\), which can be verified by subtracting 1 from both sides of the original equation: \(\frac{3x}{2} + 1 - 1 = 1.6 - 1\), resulting in \(\frac{3x}{2} = 0.6\). This step is correct.
- Katie suggests \(3x + 2 = 2.12\). To verify, multiply every term in the original equation by 2 to clear the fraction: \(3x + 2 = 3.2\). This does not match Katie's suggestion, indicating her step is incorrect.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Understanding
- A common misconception might involve incorrect manipulation of equations, such as not applying operations to every term or misinterpreting the goal of isolating the variable.
- Students might struggle with decimal arithmetic or fractions, but the numbers here are straightforward.

## 3: Evaluating Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and decimal arithmetic. They might incorrectly validate Katie's step due to a lack of understanding of how to isolate \(x\) or confusion with decimal numbers. Tom's step seems straightforward, but Katie's incorrect step might confuse some. Prediction: A=60% (recognize Tom's correctness), B=20% (incorrectly think Katie is right), C=10% (both), D=10% (neither).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes. They should easily recognize Tom's step as correct. Katie's step is clearly incorrect upon basic algebraic understanding. Prediction: A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebra and should easily identify Tom's step as correct and Katie's as incorrect. Prediction: A=90%, B=0%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and should quickly verify both steps. They are less likely to be misled by incorrect steps. Prediction: A=95%, B=0%, C=0%, D=5%.

## 4: Converting Predictions to Requested Format
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **basic:** A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced:** A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
