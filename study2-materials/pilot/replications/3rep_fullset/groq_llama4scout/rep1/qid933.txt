## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question tests the understanding of linear equations and the ability to substitute points into them to verify if the points lie on the line. A common misconception could be substituting the values incorrectly or not checking at all.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom claims that \( (5,7) \) lies on the line \( y = 2x - 3 \). To verify, we substitute \( x = 5 \) and \( y = 7 \) into the equation: \( 7 = 2(5) - 3 \), which simplifies to \( 7 = 10 - 3 \) or \( 7 = 7 \). This confirms that Tom is correct.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie claims that \( (-5,-7) \) lies on the line \( y = 2x - 3 \). Substituting \( x = -5 \) and \( y = -7 \) into the equation: \( -7 = 2(-5) - 3 \), which simplifies to \( -7 = -10 - 3 \) or \( -7 = -13 \). This shows that Katie is incorrect.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substitution and calculation. They might not even attempt to substitute or might do so incorrectly. Given the simplicity of the numbers, some might get Tom's correct by chance or calculation but struggle with Katie's. However, the straightforward nature of the question might lead some to guess or not fully understand the verification process. So, they might choose A (Only Tom) if they verify Tom's statement correctly but not Katie's, or they might not choose D (Neither is correct) if they incorrectly verify Katie's. Prediction: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to perform the substitution and calculation but might make errors in calculation or in understanding the verification process. They are likely to verify Tom's statement correctly but might struggle with Katie's or vice versa. Prediction: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily verify both statements. They know how to substitute into the equation and understand what it means for a point to lie on a line. They are likely to identify Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect. Prediction: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can easily verify the statements. They will quickly see that Tom's point satisfies the equation and Katie's does not. Prediction: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%.

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
