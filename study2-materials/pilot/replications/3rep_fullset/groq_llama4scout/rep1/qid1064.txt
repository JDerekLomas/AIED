To approach this question, let's consider the typical volumes of the objects mentioned and how students at different ability levels might perceive them.

1. **Understanding the Objects and Measurements**:
   - **Egg cup**: Typically small, used to hold an egg. Its volume would logically be small, likely in the range of a few hundred cubic centimeters or less, given that a standard egg is about 50-60 cm³.
   - **Cereal box**: Larger than an egg cup, usually around 1-2 liters (1000-2000 cm³) in volume, but this can vary.
   - **Chest of drawers**: A piece of furniture, so its volume would be significantly larger, likely several thousand cubic centimeters.
   - **Piggy bank**: Can vary but often around 1-5 liters (1000-5000 cm³), though decorative ones can be larger or smaller.

2. **Analysis of Given Measurements**:
   - **87 cm³**: Small, suitable for an egg.
   - **1013 cm³**: About 1 liter, plausible for a cereal box or small piggy bank.
   - **4172 cm³**: Larger, could fit a larger piggy bank or small chest of drawers.
   - **197,177 cm³**: Very large, likely too big for these household items, possibly a large piece of furniture or more.

3. **Reasoning for Each Ability Level**:
   - **Below Basic**: Students may struggle with understanding units or the scale of everyday objects. They might not accurately estimate volumes but could pick the smallest volume for the egg cup due to a basic understanding of size.
   - **Basic**: Students have a basic understanding of volume and everyday objects. They might correctly associate the egg cup with the smallest volume but could struggle with distinguishing between the other objects based on volume.
   - **Proficient**: Students can reasonably estimate volumes of everyday objects and are likely to choose the smallest measurement for the egg cup.
   - **Advanced**: Students not only understand volume but can also precisely estimate the size of objects. They would accurately match the egg cup with the smallest volume.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic**: Most would likely choose A (correct) because they might recognize the egg cup as small, but some might confuse it with larger objects. So, A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students would likely choose A (correct) as they understand the relative sizes. So, A=80%, B=15%, C=4%, D=1%.
- **Proficient**: Strong understanding, so A=95%, B=4%, C=1%, D=0%.
- **Advanced**: Almost certain to choose correctly. So, A=99%, B=1%, C=0%, D=0%.

Thus, the predictions are:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
proficient: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
