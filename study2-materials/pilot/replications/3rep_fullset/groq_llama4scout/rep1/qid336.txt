To approach this question, let's first understand the pictogram and what it's telling us. The pictogram uses smiley faces to represent the number of people who attended different games, with one smiley face equaling 8 people.

## Step 1: Understanding the Pictogram
The pictogram shows:
- Game 1: 4 faces
- Game 2: 3 faces
- Game 3: 2 faces
- Game 4: 2.75 faces

Given that 1 face = 8 people, we can calculate the number of people for each game.

## 2: Calculating Attendance for Game 4
For Game 4, with 2.75 faces, the calculation would be:
2.75 faces * 8 people/face = 22 people

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors
The question is designed to test if students can correctly interpret the pictogram, especially with a non-whole number of faces (2.75 faces for Game 4). A common error might be to misunderstand the scale (1 face = 8 people) or to incorrectly calculate when dealing with decimals.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the pictogram's scale or with decimal multiplication. They might choose C (2.75) because they don't understand the scale (thinking the 2.75 directly represents people without multiplying by 8), or they might incorrectly calculate.
- **Basic:** Students here should grasp the basic concept of the pictogram but might make calculation errors or not fully understand how to apply the scale correctly, especially with decimals.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily understand the pictogram and calculate Game 4's attendance correctly as 22 people, choosing D.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will not only calculate correctly but also quickly recognize the correct answer.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the question:
- **Below Basic:** A=10% (miscalculation), B=5% (random), C=60% (not converting 2.75 faces to people), D=25% (correct calculation).
- **Basic:** A=5% (careless mistake), B=10% (misunderstanding), C=20% (not applying the scale), D=65% (correct).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (minor error), B=5% (unlikely), C=5% (simple mistake), D=85% (confident in calculation).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no errors), B=0% (no chance), C=0% (understand scale), D=100% (accurate calculation).

The best answer is D. 

below_basic: A=10% B=5% C=60% D=25%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=20% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
