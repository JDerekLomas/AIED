To predict how students at different ability levels would perform on this question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to the order of operations.

The question presents two statements about the order of operations:
1. \(6 + 4 - 2 \equiv 4 - 2 + 6\)
2. \(6 + 4 \times 2 \equiv 6 \times 4 + 2\)

Let's evaluate these statements:
1. For \(6 + 4 - 2\), following the order of operations (addition and subtraction from left to right), we get \(10 - 2 = 8\).
For \(4 - 2 + 6\), we get \(2 + 6 = 8\).
So, \(6 + 4 - 2 \equiv 4 - 2 + 6\) is true.

2. For \(6 + 4 \times 2\), following the order of operations (multiplication before addition), we get \(6 + 8 = 14\).
For \(6 \times 4 + 2\), we get \(24 + 2 = 26\).
So, \(6 + 4 \times 2 \not\equiv 6 \times 4 + 2\) is false.

Therefore, only Tom is correct.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question tests the understanding of the order of operations. A common misconception is not following the order of operations correctly, especially when it comes to mixed operations.

## 2: Evaluating Student Performance
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and the concept of order of operations. They might not fully understand or remember the rules, leading to random or incorrect answers. 
  - A (Only Tom): XX%
  - B (Only Katie): XX%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): XX%
  - D (Neither is correct): XX%

## 3: Predicting Responses
Given the nature of the question, students who are below basic might have a higher chance of selecting an incorrect option due to a lack of understanding of the order of operations.

## 4: Detailed Predictions
- **Below Basic**: These students often lack a solid foundation. They might incorrectly apply operations or not understand the equivalence. Let's assume a significant portion would choose incorrectly, with a notable percentage choosing C (Both) due to a lack of understanding, and some choosing D (Neither) because they see both statements are being questioned.
  - below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make simple mistakes. They are more likely to understand the basic order of operations but could be tricked by the presentation.
  - basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%

- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of the order of operations and are less likely to make mistakes. They should easily see Tom's statement as correct and Katie's as incorrect.
  - proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply it accurately. They would easily identify Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness.
  - advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
