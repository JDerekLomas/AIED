To approach this question, let's first understand what each term means and then evaluate the given expression \(p-3 \equiv-(3-p)\) to determine its nature.

- **Equation**: A statement that two mathematical expressions have the same value. Equations often contain variables and are solved to find the value(s) of those variables.
- **Expression**: A mathematical phrase that can be evaluated to a single value. Expressions can contain numbers, variables, and mathematical operations.
- **Formula**: A general rule expressed using mathematical symbols. Formulas provide a relationship between variables and are often used to calculate a specific quantity.
- **Identity**: A mathematical statement that is always true for all values of the variables involved. In algebra, identities are equations that are true for every value of the variable(s).

Given \(p-3 \equiv-(3-p)\), let's simplify \(-(3-p)\):

\(-(3-p) = -3 + p = p - 3\)

So, \(p-3 \equiv p-3\), which means the statement is always true for all values of \(p\). 

This implies that \(p-3 \equiv-(3-p)\) is an **identity** because it is true for all values of \(p\).

Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and understanding of terms. They might confuse the concepts:
- A=30% (they might think it's an equation because they see an equal sign and think it needs to be solved)
- B=20% (could see it as just an expression because they don't fully understand the implications of \(\equiv\))
- C=10% (less likely to think it's a formula since it doesn't seem to calculate a specific quantity)
- D=40% (a significant portion might still get it right if they've been taught to recognize simple identities)

### basic
Students at this level have a better grasp of algebra but might still be confused:
- A=20% (they might still think it's an equation because they don't fully grasp the difference between an equation and an identity)
- B=15% (less likely to think it's just an expression)
- C=5% (unlikely to consider it a formula)
- D=60% (most should recognize it as an identity)

### proficient
Students at this level should have a solid understanding:
- A=10% (they know it's not just an equation to be solved)
- B=5% (they understand it's more than just an expression)
- C=5% (they recognize it's not specifically a formula for calculating something)
- D=80% (most should confidently identify it as an identity)

### advanced
Students at this level would likely have a deep understanding:
- A=5% (rarely would they confuse it with an equation)
- B=0% (they know it's not just an expression)
- C=0% (they understand it's not a formula in the traditional sense)
- D=95% (almost all would correctly identify it as an identity)

So, the predictions in the required format are:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=5% D=60%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
