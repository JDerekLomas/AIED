## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to factorise the quadratic expression \(p^{2}+5p+6\). This is a standard quadratic expression that can be factored into \((p+2)(p+3)\).

## 2: Identifying the Correct Answer
The correct factorization of \(p^{2}+5p+6\) is \((p+2)(p+3)\), which corresponds to option A. This is a straightforward factorization that most students learn early on in algebra.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception in factorizing quadratic expressions involves incorrect factorization or assuming that every quadratic expression can be easily factored into integers. However, the expression \(p^{2}+5p+6\) is specifically designed to be easily factorable, as it fits the form \((p+a)(p+b)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers that multiply to \(6\) and add up to \(5\), which are \(2\) and \(3\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not know how to factorize a quadratic expression or might incorrectly apply factorization techniques. Given the simplicity of the numbers involved, some might guess or incorrectly factor it, but a significant portion might leave it blank or choose "Does not factorise" due to a lack of understanding.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and might be familiar with simple factorizations. However, they might still struggle with ensuring they have the correct factors, especially if they are not confident in their ability to factorize. They are likely to attempt factorization but might make errors.

- **Proficient:** Students at this level are expected to have a solid grasp of algebraic techniques, including factorization of quadratic expressions. They should easily recognize that \(p^{2}+5p+6\) can be factored into \((p+2)(p+3)\).

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebra and can handle complex expressions. They will certainly be able to factor \(p^{2}+5p+6\) correctly.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (some might get it by chance or through trial and error), B=20% (incorrect factorization), C=10% (another incorrect factorization), D=30% (thinking it doesn't factorise or being completely lost).
- **Basic:** A=60% (correct factorization with some effort), B=25% (common incorrect factorization), C=10%, D=5% (recognizing it doesn't easily factor or being confused).
- **Proficient:** A=85% (easily factorized), B=10%, C=3%, D=2% (advanced students rarely make basic mistakes).
- **Advanced:** A=95% (straightforward), B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
