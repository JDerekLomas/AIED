To solve this problem, let's first understand what is being asked. Molly is expanding the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\) and we need to find out what she should get when she multiplies the two terms indicated by the arrows, which are \(-1\) and \(-4\).

## Step 1: Identify the terms to be multiplied
The terms indicated by the arrows are \(-1\) from the first bracket and \(-4\) from the second bracket.

## 2: Multiply the terms
To find the product, we multiply these two terms: \(-1 \times -4 = 4\).

## 3: Determine the correct answer
Since \(-1 \times -4 = 4\), the correct answer is \(+4\), which corresponds to option A.

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception could be that students forget that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. However, the question specifically asks for the product of \(-1\) and \(-4\), which is a straightforward multiplication.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication or forget the rule that two negatives make a positive. They might choose B (\(-4\)) because they forget the rule about negatives, or they might not understand the question. So, A=60% (correct), B=30% (incorrect due to forgetting the negative times negative rule), C=5%, D=5%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should understand basic multiplication rules, including that two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive number. However, they might be careless or unsure. So, A=80%, B=15%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a solid grasp of multiplication rules and should easily get the correct answer. So, A=95%, B=4%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level would not only get the correct answer easily but also understand the context well. So, A=99%, B=1%, C=0%, D=0%.

The best answer is A. 

Given the analysis:
below_basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
proficient: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
