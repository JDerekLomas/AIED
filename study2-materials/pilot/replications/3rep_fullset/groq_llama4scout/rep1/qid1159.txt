## Step 1: Understanding the term-to-term rule
The term-to-term rule given is to square the current term and then subtract 4. We need to apply this rule to find which sequence is produced by it.

## 2: Applying the rule to find the sequence
Starting with -3:
1. \( (-3)^2 - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5 \)
So, the sequence starts with -3, 5.

## 3: Generating the next term
Applying the rule to 5:
\( 5^2 - 4 = 25 - 4 = 21 \)
So, the sequence continues with -3, 5, 21.

## 4: Comparing with given options
- Option A: -3, 9, 5. This does not match our generated sequence.
- Option B: -3, -13, -173. Let's verify if -13 and -173 could be part of the sequence:
1. Starting with -3: \( (-3)^2 - 4 = 5 \), not -13.
- Option C: -3, 5, 21. This matches our generated sequence.
- Option D: -3, 0, 5. Let's verify:
1. Starting with -3: \( (-3)^2 - 4 = 5 \), not 0.

## 5: Analyzing potential errors
The misconception here could be misunderstanding the operation (squaring and then subtracting) or misapplying it. However, given the numbers and the straightforward nature of applying the rule, most students should be able to get it right if they understand the operations.

## 6: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the calculation or misunderstand the rule. They might choose an option that seems to follow a simpler pattern or makes a calculation mistake. Option A could be appealing due to a miscalculation or incorrect application of the rule. \( A=40\% B=20\% C=20\% D=20\% \)
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make calculation errors. They are more likely to recognize the correct sequence but could be tempted by sequences that look like they could fit a pattern. \( A=20\% B=10\% C=60\% D=10\% \)
- **Proficient:** These students understand the mathematical concepts and can apply them accurately. They are likely to identify the correct sequence with ease. \( A=5\% B=5\% C=85\% D=5\% \)
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them quickly and accurately. They are highly likely to choose the correct option. \( A=0\% B=0\% C=95\% D=5\% \)

## 7: Finalizing predictions
Given the analysis, the predictions are:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic:** A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
