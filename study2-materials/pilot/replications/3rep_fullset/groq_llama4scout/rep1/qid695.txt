To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 18 \div 2+2 \times 2= \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question requires the application of the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). The correct calculation is:

1. \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \)
2. \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \)
3. \( 9 + 4 = 13 \)

So, the correct answer is B: \( 13 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception is to ignore the order of operations, leading to incorrect calculations. For example, calculating \( 18 \div 2 + 2 \times 2 \) as \( 18 \div (2 + 2) \times 2 \) or simply adding and subtracting from left to right without considering multiplication and division first.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 3 \) seems too low and unlikely to be a result of a simple miscalculation related to order of operations.
- Option B: \( 13 \) is the correct answer following the order of operations.
- Option C: \( 22 \) could result from \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \) and then \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \), but then incorrectly adding \( 9 + 4 \times 2 = 9 + 8 = 17 \) or misinterpreting the operations entirely.
- Option D: \( 12 \) could result from a miscalculation such as \( 18 \div (2+2) = 18 \div 4 = 4.5 \) and \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \), then \( 4.5 + 4 = 8.5 \) or another incorrect approach.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand or remember the order of operations. They might calculate from left to right: \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \), \( 9 + 2 = 11 \), \( 11 \times 2 = 22 \). So, they might choose C: \( 22 \) (40%), or make other errors leading to A: \( 3 \) (20%), B: \( 13 \) (20%), and D: \( 12 \) (20%).
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still struggle with the order of operations. They might get it right (B: \( 13 \), 40%) or mistakenly calculate to get C: \( 22 \) (30%), or D: \( 12 \) (20%), with some choosing A: \( 3 \) (10%).
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand the order of operations well. They should mostly choose B: \( 13 \) (80%), with some possible errors leading to C: \( 22 \) (10%), D: \( 12 \) (5%), and A: \( 3 \) (5%).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including the order of operations. They should almost all choose B: \( 13 \) (95%), with very few errors.

## 4: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
- **basic**: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%

The best answer is B.
