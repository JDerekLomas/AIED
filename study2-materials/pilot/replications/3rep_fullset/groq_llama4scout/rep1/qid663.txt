To solve this, let's break down Teddy's method and apply it to both questions to understand the pattern and potential pitfalls.

## Step 1: Understand Teddy's Method
Teddy calculates \(600 \div 25\) by first noting there are \(4\) lots of \(25\) in \(100\), then multiplying \(4\) by \(6\) (since \(600 = 6 \times 100\)) to get \(24\). Thus, his method involves:
1. Finding how many lots of \(25\) are in \(100\), which is \(4\).
2. Multiplying this by how many hundreds are in the number being divided, which for \(600\) is \(6\).

## 2: Apply Teddy's Method to \(800 \div 25\)
For \(800 \div 25\), Teddy would:
1. Still know there are \(4\) lots of \(25\) in \(100\).
2. Since \(800 = 8 \times 100\), he would then multiply \(4\) by \(8\).

## 3: Analyze the Options
- A: There are \(4\) lots of \(25\) in \(100\), then I multiplied \(4\) by \(8\), so the answer is \(32\). This matches Teddy's method.
- B: There are \(4\) lots of \(25\) in \(100\), then I multiplied \(8\) by \(6\), so the answer is \(48\). This does not match because it incorrectly applies the multiplication.
- C: There are \(6\) lots of \(25\) in \(100\), then I multiplied \(6\) by \(4\), so the answer is \(24\). This is incorrect because it mistakenly uses \(6\) lots of \(25\) in \(100\).
- D: There are \(8\) lots of \(25\) in \(100\), then I multiplied \(8\) by \(6\), so the answer is \(48\). This is incorrect for two reasons: \(25\) does not go into \(100\) \(8\) times, and it incorrectly multiplies.

## 4: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with division and multiplication facts. They might not fully understand Teddy's method or apply it correctly. Option A seems likely for those who grasp the basic idea but might confuse the numbers. Incorrect options like B, C, and D could be chosen due to miscalculation or misunderstanding of Teddy's method. **A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%**
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make errors in applying methods to new problems. They are more likely to understand the division but could misapply Teddy's logic. **A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%**
- **Proficient**: These students understand division and can apply logical methods. They should easily follow Teddy's method and choose A. **A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%**
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand but can also critically evaluate methods. They will certainly choose A. **A=99%, B=1%, C=0%, D=0%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
