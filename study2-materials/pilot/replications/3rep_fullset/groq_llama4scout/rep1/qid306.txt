To approach this question, let's analyze the problems presented and the common misconceptions or areas of difficulty students might have, particularly with the order of operations.

## Step 1: Understand the Order of Operations
The order of operations is a fundamental concept in mathematics, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). For Problem P (\( 4-5+6= \)) and Problem Q (\( 4+5 \times 6= \)), we need to apply these rules.

## 2: Analyze Problem P
In Problem P, \( 4-5+6= \), there are no brackets, indices, division, or multiplication operations; only addition and subtraction are present. According to the order of operations, when only addition and subtraction are involved, we work from left to right. Therefore, the first calculation to do in Problem P is \( 4-5 \).

## 3: Analyze Problem Q
In Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6= \), multiplication and addition are involved. Following the order of operations (BIDMAS), we must perform the multiplication before the addition. Therefore, the first calculation to do in Problem Q is \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 4: Evaluate the Options
- Option A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for Problem Q because it suggests doing \( 4+5 \) first, not the multiplication.
- Option B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Correct for both problems based on the order of operations.
- Option C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for both; it misapplies the order of operations.
- Option D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Incorrect for Problem P; it suggests doing \( 5+6 \) first, which is not following the left-to-right rule for just addition and subtraction.

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might choose options that seem logical but are incorrect, such as doing all additions and subtractions first or not understanding the precedence of multiplication. Option A or C might appeal due to a lack of understanding of BIDMAS. 
  - \( A=30\% \) (some understanding but flawed), \( B=20\% \) (correct but might be guesswork), \( C=30\% \) (common misconception), \( D=20\% \) (some understanding of multiplication coming first).

- **Basic**: Students here have a basic grasp but might still make errors, especially if they haven't solidified their understanding of BIDMAS.
  - \( A=20\% \), \( B=60\% \) (as they start to understand the correct order), \( C=10\% \), \( D=10\% \).

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a good grasp of the order of operations.
  - \( A=5\% \), \( B=80\% \) (strong understanding), \( C=5\% \), \( D=10\% \).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can apply the concepts accurately and efficiently.
  - \( A=0\% \), \( B=90\% \) (confident in their understanding), \( C=0\% \), \( D=10\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
