To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "How many days in a non-leap year?", let's analyze the question and the potential for errors based on common misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the number of days in a non-leap year. A non-leap year has 365 days. This is a basic fact that students should know.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing a non-leap year with a leap year. A leap year has 366 days, so students who confuse the two might choose option B (\(366\)). Another potential error could be choosing an implausibly low or high number of days, such as option A (\(350\)) or option D (\(100\)), though these seem less likely as they are far from the correct answer and not related to the known properties of years.

## 3: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A (\(350\)) seems too low and not a commonly associated number with years.
- Option B (\(366\)) is the number of days in a leap year, a common misconception for those who confuse non-leap and leap years.
- Option C (\(365\)) is the correct number of days in a non-leap year.
- Option D (\(100\)) is implausibly low and not related to any known calendar-based unit.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with basic facts. They could be more likely to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding or attention to the question.
- A (\(350\)): \(10\%\) (some might guess)
- B (\(366\)): \(20\%\) (confusing with leap year)
- C (\(365\)): \(60\%\) (if they recall or can deduce)
- D (\(100\)): \(10\%\) (unlikely, but possible due to lack of knowledge)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make simple mistakes.
- A (\(350\)): \(5\%\)
- B (\(366\)): \(15\%\)
- C (\(365\)): \(80\%\)
- D (\(100\)): \(0\%\)

### proficient
Proficient students are expected to have a solid grasp of basic facts.
- A (\(350\)): \(0\%\)
- B (\(366\)): \(5\%\)
- C (\(365\)): \(95\%\)
- D (\(100\)): \(0\%\)

### advanced
Advanced students would likely have an excellent understanding, minimizing errors.
- A (\(350\)): \(0\%\)
- B (\(366\)): \(0\%\)
- C (\(365\)): \(100\%\)
- D (\(100\)): \(0\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=80% D=0%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
