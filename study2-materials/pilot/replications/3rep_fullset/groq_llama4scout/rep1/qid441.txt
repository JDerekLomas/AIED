## Step 1: Understand the task
We need to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option for calculating the total surface area of a given cuboid.

## 2: Recall the formula for the total surface area of a cuboid
The total surface area (TSA) of a cuboid is given by the formula TSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh, where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height of the cuboid, respectively.

## 3: Apply the formula to the given cuboid
Given the dimensions of the cuboid are length (l) = 4cm, width (w) = 2cm, and height (h) = 7cm, we substitute these into the formula: TSA = 2(4*2) + 2(4*7) + 2(2*7).

## 4: Simplify the formula with the given dimensions
TSA = 2(8) + 2(28) + 2(14) = 16 + 56 + 28 = 100 cm^2.

## 5: Compare with the given options
- Option A: \( (2 \times 7)+(4 \times 2)+(4 \times 7) \) calculates the area of three faces, not the total surface area.
- Option B: \( [(2 \times 7)+(4 \times 2)+(4 \times 7)] \times 2 \) calculates the total surface area by finding the area of three faces and then multiplying by 2.
- Option C: \( (2 \times 7) \times(4 \times 2) \times(4 \times 7) \) is incorrect as it multiplies the areas of three faces together, not adding them.
- Option D: \( 2 \times 4 \times 7 \) calculates the volume, not the surface area.

## 6: Analyze Option A
Option A, \( (2 \times 7)+(4 \times 2)+(4 \times 7) \), equals \( 14 + 8 + 28 = 50 \) cm^2, which is the sum of the areas of three faces.

## 7: Analyze Option B
Option B, \( [(2 \times 7)+(4 \times 2)+(4 \times 7)] \times 2 \), equals \( (14 + 8 + 28) \times 2 = 50 \times 2 = 100 \) cm^2, which correctly calculates the total surface area.

## 8: Analyze Option C
Option C, \( (2 \times 7) \times(4 \times 2) \times(4 \times 7) \), equals \( 14 \times 8 \times 28 \), which is a very large number and incorrect for surface area.

## 9: Analyze Option D
Option D, \( 2 \times 4 \times 7 \), equals \( 56 \) cm^3, which is the volume, not the surface area.

## 10: Predict student responses
- **Below_basic**: Students may struggle with the concept of surface area and the formula. They might choose D (volume) or C (incorrect multiplication), with A being a possible choice if they understand face area but not total surface area. B seems less likely as it requires understanding of the formula and applying it correctly. Prediction: A=30% (simple but incorrect), B=20% (some understanding but might not apply correctly), C=30% (misconception of multiplication), D=20% (confusing with volume).
- **Basic**: Students have a basic understanding and might recognize the need to add areas but could struggle with applying the correct formula. They might lean towards A (as it represents three faces) or B (if they understand the doubling for total surface area). Prediction: A=40%, B=30%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of surface area and can apply the formula. They are likely to choose B. Prediction: A=10%, B=70%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand but can quickly calculate and verify. They will choose B. Prediction: A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 11: Adjust predictions based on common misconceptions and understanding
Given common errors and the simplicity of the question for higher ability levels, adjust predictions to reflect likely student performance.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0%
