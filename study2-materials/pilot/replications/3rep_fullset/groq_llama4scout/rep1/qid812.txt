To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and the potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question provides a displacement-time graph and states that Mo travelled at a speed of \(6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\) during the first \(10\) seconds. The task is to find the distance (displacement) at \(10\) seconds, represented by the star in the graph.

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept
The key concept here is that speed = distance / time. For an object moving at a constant speed, the distance travelled is equal to the speed multiplied by the time taken. In this case, if Mo travelled at \(6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\) for \(10\) seconds, the distance (or displacement, in this context) travelled would be \(6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \times 10 \mathrm{~s} = 60 \mathrm{~m}\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be confusing distance with speed or not understanding that the graph represents displacement over time, which directly relates to speed when the line is straight. However, the question explicitly mentions speed and provides a straightforward calculation, reducing the likelihood of misconceptions about the type of graph or the physical quantities involved.

## 3: Analyzing Option Appeal
- Option A: \(30 \mathrm{~m}\) would imply a speed of \(3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\), which does not match the given speed.
- Option B: \(6 \mathrm{~m}\) would imply a speed of \(0.6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\), which is incorrect.
- Option C: \(60 \mathrm{~m}\) directly results from \(6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \times 10 \mathrm{~s}\), making it the correct answer.
- Option D: \(16 \mathrm{~m}\) does not relate to the given speed and time in a simple calculation.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the calculation or understanding the question. They might choose B (6%) because it's a small, manageable number or A (30%) because it seems like a plausible short distance. However, given the simplicity of the calculation, a significant portion might still get it wrong or choose randomly. So, below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students here should be able to perform the calculation but might be prone to errors if they misread the question or forgot the formula. They are likely to choose C (60%) but might also consider A (30%) as a possible speed-related answer. So, basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily calculate \(6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \times 10 \mathrm{~s} = 60 \mathrm{~m}\) and choose C. They are less likely to be misled by other options. So, proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%.
- **Advanced:** For advanced students, this question is straightforward. They will quickly identify that the correct answer is C (60%) with minimal chance of error. So, advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
