## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to estimate the gradient of a curve at a specific point, given a graph of velocity over time for a parachutist. The gradient of the curve at any point represents the acceleration of the parachutist at that time.

## 2: Identifying Key Information
The graph provides a tangent line at \( t = 8 \) seconds, which passes through the points \( (8, 51) \) and \( (0, 40) \). This information can be used to calculate the gradient of the tangent line, which is the best estimate for the acceleration at \( t = 8 \) seconds.

## 3: Calculating the Gradient
The gradient \( m \) of a line passing through two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by \( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \). For the points \( (8, 51) \) and \( (0, 40) \), the gradient is \( \frac{51 - 40}{8 - 0} = \frac{11}{8} = 1.375 \).

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 51 \) - This is the velocity at \( t = 8 \) seconds, not the gradient.
- Option B: \( 0.72... \) - This seems too low for the gradient given the change in velocity over the interval.
- Option C: \( 1.375 \) - This matches the calculated gradient.
- Option D: \( 6.375 \) - This seems too high for the gradient given the relatively gentle slope of the tangent.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with calculating gradients or understanding the concept of acceleration. They might confuse the velocity value with the gradient or fail to use the given points correctly. Expect a high percentage choosing A (velocity value) or incorrect calculations leading to D.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the concept but struggle with applying it. They might correctly calculate the gradient but choose an incorrect option due to miscalculation or misunderstanding the question. Option C is likely to be chosen by a significant percentage, but some might incorrectly choose A or D.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to accurately calculate the gradient using the given points and understand that the gradient represents acceleration. A significant percentage should choose C.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only calculate the gradient correctly but also understand the context and implications. They are likely to choose C with a high degree of accuracy.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation and the clear information provided:
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (misinterpreting velocity for gradient), B=10%, C=20%, D=10%
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=10%, C=60%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=90%, D=10%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
