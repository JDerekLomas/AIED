To approach this question, let's first evaluate each option given \(h = 5\).

## Step 1: Evaluate \(3h^{2}\) and \((3h)^{2}\) for \(h = 5\)
Given \(h = 5\), let's calculate \(3h^{2}\) and \((3h)^{2}\).
- \(3h^{2} = 3 \times 5^{2} = 3 \times 25 = 75\)
- \((3h)^{2} = (3 \times 5)^{2} = 15^{2} = 225\)

## 2: Compare Calculations with Given Options
Now, let's compare these calculations with the provided options:
- A: \(3h^{2} = 75\) and \((3h)^{2} = 75\). Our calculations show this is incorrect because \((3h)^{2} = 225\), not \(75\).
- B: \(3h^{2} = 75\) and \((3h)^{2} = 225\). This matches our calculations.
- C: \(3h^{2} = 225\) and \((3h)^{2} = 225\). Our calculations show \(3h^{2} = 75\), not \(225\), so this is incorrect.
- D: \(3h^{2} = 225\) and \((3h)^{2} = 75\). Our calculations show this is incorrect because both values do not match what we found.

## 3: Analyze Potential for Misconceptions
The common misconception here involves understanding the difference between \(3h^{2}\) and \((3h)^{2}\). The question requires students to apply the order of operations and understand that \(3h^{2} = 3 \times h^{2}\) while \((3h)^{2} = (3 \times h)^{2} = 9h^{2}\). For \(h = 5\), \(9h^{2} = 9 \times 25 = 225\), which can help in identifying the correct option but also requires attention to detail to avoid calculation mistakes.

## 4: Predict Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and calculations. They might not accurately calculate \(3h^{2}\) and \((3h)^{2}\) or might confuse the two expressions. Given the simplicity of the numbers, they might still manage to get \(3h^{2} = 75\) but could easily confuse \((3h)^{2}\) with \(3h^{2}\) or make calculation errors. A=20% (guessing), B=40% (closest match with some calculation skills), C=20% (misinterpreting both), D=20% (misinterpreting both).
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a better grasp of algebraic expressions but might still fall into common traps. They are likely to calculate \(3h^{2}\) correctly but might need to think more about \((3h)^{2}\). B=60% (correct calculation), A=20% (error in \((3h)^{2}\)), C=10% (error in \(3h^{2}\)), D=10% (errors in both).
- **Proficient:** Students here are expected to handle algebraic expressions confidently. They should easily distinguish between \(3h^{2}\) and \((3h)^{2}\) and calculate them accurately. B=80% (accurate calculations), A=10% (mistake in recognizing \((3h)^{2}\)), C=5% (unlikely to miscalculate both), D=5% (unlikely to miscalculate both).
- **Advanced:** These students not only calculate accurately but also understand the underlying algebraic structures. They are highly unlikely to make mistakes in distinguishing between these expressions. B=95% (accurate), A=3% (rare mistake), C=1% (very rare mistake), D=1% (very rare mistake).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=3% B=95% C=1% D=1%
