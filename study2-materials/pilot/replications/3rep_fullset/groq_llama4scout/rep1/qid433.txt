To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls or understandings associated with it.

The question asks students to identify the type of data Leanne is collecting by asking, "Describe how you feel when you are about to go on holiday." This question requires an understanding of primary vs. secondary data and qualitative vs. quantitative data.

- **Primary data** is collected firsthand by the researcher (in this case, Leanne), which applies here since she's collecting the data herself.
- **Secondary data** is collected from existing sources.
- **Qualitative data** is descriptive and not numerical, which applies here because the question asks for a description of feelings.
- **Quantitative data** is numerical.

Given these definitions:

- The data is **primary** because Leanne is collecting it herself.
- The data is **qualitative** because it involves descriptions of feelings rather than numerical values.

So, the correct answer is **D: Primary Qualitative data**.

Now, let's consider the potential for errors at different ability levels:

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with basic definitions:
- A=30% (might confuse with quantitative due to lack of understanding)
- B=10% (unlikely to consider secondary data in this context)
- C=20% (might confuse qualitative with attribute or think it's quantitative)
- D=40% (some might get it right if they vaguely recall primary and qualitative)

### basic
Students at this level have a better grasp but might still make careless errors:
- A=20% (less likely to think it's quantitative but could be unsure)
- B=5% (recognize it's not secondary)
- C=15% (understand it's not quantitative but might not know attribute data is typically a characteristic)
- D=60% (most understand primary and qualitative aspects)

### proficient
These students are more likely to understand the concepts clearly:
- A=5% (rarely confuse with quantitative)
- B=0% (know it's not secondary)
- C=5% (understand it's qualitative, not attribute data)
- D=90% (clear understanding of primary qualitative)

### advanced
Students at this level are very familiar with these concepts and are less likely to make mistakes:
- A=0% (no confusion with quantitative)
- B=0% (clear it's not secondary)
- C=0% (attribute data is not a common term they would confuse here)
- D=100% (confidently identify as primary qualitative)

So, here are the predictions:

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=5% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=5% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
