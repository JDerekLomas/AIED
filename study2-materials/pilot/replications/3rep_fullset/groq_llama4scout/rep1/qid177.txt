To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given inequality \(2x > 7\), let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The inequality \(2x > 7\) requires the student to divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(x\), which yields \(x > 3.5\). This is a straightforward process, but the question is whether students will fall into common misconceptions or simply solve it correctly.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve misunderstanding the direction of the inequality when dividing or multiplying by a negative number (which is not the case here since we're dividing by a positive 2). Another could be not completing the solution to the point of isolating \(x\) or misinterpreting the inequality sign.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(x > 4\) suggests a miscalculation or incorrect rounding.
- Option B: \(x = 3.5\) suggests an equality instead of an inequality.
- Option C: \(x < 3.5\) reverses the inequality sign incorrectly.
- Option D: \(x > 3.5\) is the correct solution.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly divide both sides by 2 or misunderstand the inequality. 
  - A: Expect some to guess or make calculation errors, so \(A = 20\%\).
  - B: This could appeal to those who think in terms of equality, \(B = 30\%\).
  - C: Some might reverse the inequality incorrectly, \(C = 20\%\).
  - D: Correct answer, but might be challenging, \(D = 30\%\).

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might make simple mistakes.
  - A: \(A = 10\%\), as they are better but can still make errors.
  - B: \(B = 10\%\), understanding that the solution isn't an equality.
  - C: \(C = 5\%\), fewer will reverse the inequality.
  - D: \(D = 75\%\), most should get it right.

- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with algebra and should solve it correctly with minimal errors.
  - A: \(A = 5\%\).
  - B: \(B = 0\%\), as they understand it's not an equation.
  - C: \(C = 0\%\), they know not to reverse the inequality with positive division.
  - D: \(D = 95\%\), almost all get it right.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are very confident and have a deep understanding.
  - A: \(A = 0\%\), no errors expected.
  - B: \(B = 0\%\).
  - C: \(C = 0\%\).
  - D: \(D = 100\%\), all should solve it correctly.

## 4: Conclusion
Given the straightforward nature of solving \(2x > 7\), most students, even at the basic level, should be able to solve it correctly. The real challenge comes from misconceptions or simple errors.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
