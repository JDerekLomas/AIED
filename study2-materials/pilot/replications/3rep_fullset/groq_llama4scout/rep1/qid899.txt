## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question asks students to identify the first calculation to be performed in the expression \(10-8 \times 7+6\), based on the order of operations.

## 2: Recall Order of Operations
The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (or PEMDAS in the US), which stands for Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. This means that multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction, and within those pairs, operations are performed from left to right.

## 3: Analyze the Expression
The given expression is \(10-8 \times 7+6\). According to BIDMAS, the first operation to be performed is the multiplication, which is \(8 \times 7\).

## 4: Evaluate the Options
- A: \(7+6\) is incorrect because addition should be performed after multiplication according to BIDMAS.
- B: \(10-8\) is incorrect because subtraction should be performed after multiplication.
- C: \(8 \times 7\) is correct because multiplication should be performed before addition and subtraction.
- D: "It doesn't matter: you get the same answer" is incorrect because the order of operations does matter; performing operations out of order can lead to incorrect results.

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might choose A or B because they seem like simple operations to perform first, or they might not recognize the correct order. C is the correct answer, but these students might not know it. D could be chosen by those who do not understand the concept or think that the order does not affect the outcome. Prediction: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of math operations but might still struggle with the order of operations. They are more likely to recognize that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. Prediction: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are expected to have a solid understanding of the order of operations. They should easily recognize that \(8 \times 7\) should be done first. Prediction: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the order of operations but are also likely to apply it correctly without hesitation. Prediction: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%.
