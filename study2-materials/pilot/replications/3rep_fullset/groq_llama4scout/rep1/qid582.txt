To solve this, let's first complete the square for the given expression \(3g^{2} - 18g - 7\) and see what should replace the triangle.

## Step 1: Factor out the coefficient of \(g^{2}\) from the first two terms
The expression can be rewritten as \(3(g^{2} - 6g) - 7\).

## 2: Complete the square for \(g^{2} - 6g\)
To complete the square for \(g^{2} - 6g\), we add \(\left(\frac{6}{2}\right)^{2} = 3^{2} = 9\) inside the parenthesis. However, since this is multiplied by 3, we actually add \(3 \times 9 = 27\) to the whole expression. So, we have \(3(g^{2} - 6g + 9) - 7 - 27\).

## 3: Simplify and rewrite
This simplifies to \(3(g - 3)^{2} - 34\).

## 4: Compare with the given expression
The given expression is \(3(g - 3)^{2} \triangle\). So, \(\triangle\) should be \(-34\) to make the equation true.

## 5: Analyze the difficulty of the question
This question requires the student to understand the process of completing the square and to apply it correctly. The numbers are chosen such that completing the square leads to a straightforward calculation. The potential for error lies in correctly adjusting for the factor of 3 outside the parenthesis and accurately calculating the constant term.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with completing the square or with the algebraic manipulations involved. They might not accurately calculate the value to replace the triangle or might choose an option without calculation. Given the straightforward nature of the calculations once the method is understood, a significant portion might guess or incorrectly calculate, leading to a spread across options but likely with a higher percentage on options that seem plausible or are close to the correct calculation.

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebraic techniques but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to attempt completing the square but could easily miscalculate, especially if they don't properly account for the factor of 3.

- **Proficient**: These students understand completing the square and can apply it. They are likely to get the correct answer but might still make small errors in calculation.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident and accurate in their algebraic manipulations. They are likely to quickly and correctly complete the square and choose the right option.

## 7: Estimate percentages based on understanding
Given the question's clarity and the straightforward calculation required:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20% (Many might not know how to complete the square or calculate incorrectly)
- **Basic**: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15% (Most attempt to complete the square but some errors)
- **Proficient**: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10% (Most get it right with few errors)
- **Advanced**: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5% (Almost all get it right)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
