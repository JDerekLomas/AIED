To approach this question, let's consider the concept of rotational symmetry and how students at different ability levels might perceive it.

Rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a shape can be rotated by a certain angle and still look the same. The order of rotational symmetry is the number of positions a shape can be rotated to match itself.

## Step 1: Understanding the Shape
The given shape consists of two ellipses (or ovals) centered on the same point but oriented at right angles to each other. 

## 2: Identifying Rotational Symmetry
- A shape has rotational symmetry of order 1 if it looks the same after a rotation of 360 degrees (or 0 degrees), which applies to all shapes.
- For an order greater than 1, the shape must look the same after a rotation of less than 360 degrees.

## 3: Analyzing the Specific Shape
This shape will look the same after a rotation of 180 degrees because rotating it by 180 degrees around its central point will align the ellipses with their original positions (just rotated). It does not look the same after a 90-degree or 270-degree rotation because the ellipses will not align with their original orientation.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of rotational symmetry. They might not recognize that a 180-degree rotation makes the shape look the same, potentially leading them to choose A (0) because they don't see any symmetry, or B (1) because they acknowledge it looks the same after a full rotation.
- **Basic:** Students here should have a grasp of basic symmetry concepts. They might realize the shape looks the same after a 180-degree rotation, suggesting an order of 2. However, some might still choose B (1) if they don't consider any other rotations.
- **Proficient:** These students should understand rotational symmetry well. They should recognize the shape has an order of 2 because it looks the same after a 180-degree rotation.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand rotational symmetry but also apply it accurately. They should easily identify the order as 2.

## 5: Estimating Response Percentages
Given the shape and the concept:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (misunderstanding symmetry), B=40% (recognizes only full rotation), C=20% (some understanding of symmetry), D=10% (overestimating symmetry).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=30% (limited understanding), C=50% (correct understanding), D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=10%, C=80% (strong understanding), D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=90% (excellent understanding), D=10%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
