To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and the algebraic manipulation required.

The expression given is \( \frac{x^{2}-1}{x+1} \). This can be simplified using the difference of squares formula, \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \), which applies here as \( x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1) \). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[ \frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x + 1} \]

For \( x \neq -1 \), this simplifies further to \( x - 1 \), because the \( (x + 1) \) terms cancel out.

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Answer
The correct simplification of the given expression is \( x - 1 \), which corresponds to option C.

## 2: Consider Common Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not fully simplifying the expression or incorrectly canceling terms. However, the structure of this question is straightforward, and the algebraic identity is well-known.

## 3: Analyze by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and may not recognize the difference of squares or might not cancel terms correctly. They might choose A (\( x+1 \)) because it directly involves the denominator, or they might not simplify it at all and choose D. Expect a high percentage to choose D due to confusion.
  
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have some familiarity with algebraic expressions and possibly the difference of squares. However, they might still make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose C (\( x-1 \)) but with a notable percentage choosing D due to uncertainty.

- **Proficient:** These students are expected to comfortably simplify algebraic expressions and recognize common factorizations. They should predominantly choose C (\( x-1 \)) with very few choosing D, as they understand the cancellation and the factorization.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level will easily recognize and apply the necessary algebraic manipulations. They will likely all choose C (\( x-1 \)) with virtually no one choosing D, as the concept is foundational.

## 4: Estimate Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the commonality of the algebraic identity:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% ( direct relation to denominator), B=10% (misinterpretation), C=30% (correct but through luck), D=40% (no understanding).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=2%, C=92%, D=1%.
- **Advanced:** A=1%, B=1%, C=98%, D=0%.

The best answer is C. 

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=92% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=98% D=0%
