To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The question requires expanding and simplifying \((3y - 4)^2\). The correct expansion uses the formula \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\), which in this case yields \((3y)^2 - 2 \cdot 3y \cdot 4 + 4^2 = 9y^2 - 24y + 16\).

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Answer
The correct answer is \(9y^2 - 24y + 16\), which corresponds to option C.

## 2: Analyze Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to forget the middle term \(-2ab\) (in this case, \(-2 \cdot 3y \cdot 4 = -24y\)), leading to incorrect expansions like \(9y^2 + 16\) (option B) or \(9y^2 - 16\) (option A). Another possible error could be not fully expanding the expression and leaving it in its original form or a partially simplified version, such as option D.

## 3: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle significantly with algebraic manipulations and are likely to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding of the expansion formula or not being able to simplify the expression correctly. They might opt for \(9y^2 - 16\) (A) or \(9y^2 + 16\) (B) due to misunderstanding or omitting steps.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes or not fully apply the formula. They could choose A, B, or D due to partial understanding or errors in calculation.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to have a solid grasp of algebraic identities and should be able to expand and simplify the expression correctly, choosing option C. However, some might still opt for D if they are unsure about how to proceed with the expansion.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to get the question correct, choosing option C, with minimal chance of selecting incorrect options due to their strong understanding of algebraic concepts.

## 4: Predict Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (simple incorrect expansion), B=30% (another form of incorrect expansion), C=10% (correct but challenging), D=20% (not expanding fully).
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=15%, C=60% (most get it right with some effort), D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
