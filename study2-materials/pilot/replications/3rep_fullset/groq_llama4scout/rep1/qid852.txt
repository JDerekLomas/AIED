## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question provides a table of values for the equation $y = 3x$ with some missing values. The table has $x$ in the top left, a star in the top right, $y$ in the bottom left, and $-1$ in the bottom right. We need to find the value that replaces the star.

## 2: Identifying the relationship
Given $y = 3x$, and the bottom right value of $y$ is $-1$, we can find $x$ by rearranging the equation: $x = \frac{y}{3}$. Substituting $y = -1$, we get $x = \frac{-1}{3}$.

## 3: Analyzing the options
- Option A: $-3$
- Option B: $-0.3$
- Option C: $-\frac{1}{3}$
- Option D: There is no possible solution

## 4: Predicting student responses
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substitution and rearranging equations. They might not understand how to use the given equation to find $x$ or $y$. Given the straightforward nature of the calculation ($\frac{-1}{3}$), but potentially confusing table layout, they might be inclined to guess or pick an answer that seems "simple". Option C directly matches our calculation, so it's likely to be chosen by those who grasp the concept. A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
- **Basic**: Students at this level should understand the equation $y=3x$ and be able to substitute values. They might make calculation errors or get confused with the table layout. Option C is the correct answer, and most should be able to calculate $x = \frac{-1}{3}$. A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
- **Proficient**: These students are confident with linear equations and substitution. They should easily identify that $x = -\frac{1}{3}$ when $y = -1$. Thus, they should predominantly choose Option C. A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of equations and can manipulate them with ease. They should quickly see that $x = -\frac{1}{3}$ and confidently choose Option C. A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
