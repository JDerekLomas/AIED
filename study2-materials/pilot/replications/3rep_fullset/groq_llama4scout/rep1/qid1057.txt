To approach this question, let's consider what makes it easy or hard and how students at different ability levels might respond.

The expression given is \(p^{2} + 100p\). The task is to factorize it, if possible. A common misconception in factorization is not recognizing that an expression can be factorized by taking out a common factor. In this case, \(p\) is a common factor.

## Step 1: Understanding the Expression
The expression \(p^{2} + 100p\) can be factorized by taking \(p\) as a common factor: \(p(p + 100)\). This matches option A.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A potential misconception could involve trying to factor the expression into two binomials that are not obviously related to taking a common factor, or incorrectly assuming it factors into a perfect square or another form that doesn't apply here.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \((p-10)(p+10)\), suggests a difference of squares, which would apply if the expression were \(p^{2} - 100\). This does not match our expression.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \((p+10)(p+10)\) or \((p+10)^{2}\), would imply \(p^{2} + 20p + 100\), which does not match our expression.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, "Does not factorise," is incorrect because \(p^{2} + 100p\) can indeed be factorized by taking out \(p\), yielding \(p(p + 100)\).

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic factorization. They might not recognize \(p\) as a common factor or might try to apply incorrect factorization techniques. Thus, they might be more likely to choose B, C, or D.
  - A: 40% (they might get it by chance or recognize the common factor)
  - B: 20%
  - C: 20%
  - D: 20%

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and are more likely to recognize \(p\) as a common factor.
  - A: 70%
  - B: 15%
  - C: 10%
  - D: 5%

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts, including factorization.
  - A: 90%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 3%
  - D: 2%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their algebraic manipulation skills.
  - A: 95%
  - B: 2%
  - C: 1%
  - D: 2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
