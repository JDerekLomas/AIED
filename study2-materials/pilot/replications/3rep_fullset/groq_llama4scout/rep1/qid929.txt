To approach this question, let's first understand what is being tested. The question is about factorising a quadratic expression of the form \(x^{2} + bx + c\), specifically \(x^{2} + 6x + 8\). When factorising such an expression, we look for two numbers that add up to \(b\) (in this case, 6) and multiply to give \(c\) (in this case, 8). The correct process involves finding two numbers that satisfy these conditions, which are 2 and 4 because \(2 + 4 = 6\) and \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

The question aims to test the understanding of this process by presenting options that reflect common misconceptions or misunderstandings of the factorisation process.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at different ability levels (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option.

## Step 2: Identifying the Correct Option
The correct option is A: Add to give \(6\) and multiply to give \(8\), as this accurately describes the requirement for factorising \(x^{2} + 6x + 8\).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
- Option B suggests adding to give \(6x\) and multiplying to give \(8\), which misinterprets the algebraic terms.
- Option C suggests adding to give \(8\) and multiplying to give \(6\), which swaps the required operations and values.
- Option D suggests adding to give \(8x\) and multiplying to give \(6\), which again misinterprets both the operations and the algebraic terms.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below_Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic concepts. They might be confused about the operations (addition and multiplication) and the terms (constants vs. variables). Thus, they might be more likely to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding. 
  - A: 40% (some might recall the basic concept but struggle with application)
  - B: 25% (confusion with algebraic terms)
  - C: 20% (misunderstanding of addition and multiplication requirements)
  - D: 15% (least likely due to complexity)

- **Basic**: These students have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to carelessness or partial understanding.
  - A: 60% (understand the basic concept)
  - B: 20% (some confusion with terms)
  - C: 10% (less likely to confuse operations)
  - D: 10% (similarly less likely)

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make errors.
  - A: 80% (strong understanding)
  - B: 10% (occasional careless mistake)
  - C: 5% (unlikely to confuse operations)
  - D: 5% (similarly unlikely)

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately and efficiently.
  - A: 95% (very strong understanding)
  - B: 3% (rare mistake)
  - C: 1% (very unlikely)
  - D: 1% (very unlikely)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
