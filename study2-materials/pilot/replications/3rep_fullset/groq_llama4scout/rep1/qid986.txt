## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a simple algebraic equation and two proposed next steps in solving it. Students are asked to evaluate whether Tom's or Katie's suggested next steps are correct.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Suggestion
Tom suggests that a correct next line of working could be \( \frac{x}{2} = 16 \). To verify this, we start with the given equation \( \frac{x-6}{2} = 10 \). Multiplying both sides by 2 gives \( x - 6 = 20 \). Adding 6 to both sides yields \( x = 26 \). Then, dividing 26 by 2 indeed gives 13, not 16, so Tom's suggestion seems incorrect at first glance.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Suggestion
Katie suggests that a correct next line of working could be \( x - 6 = 5 \). Starting with \( \frac{x-6}{2} = 10 \), multiplying both sides by 2 gives \( x - 6 = 20 \), which does not match Katie's suggestion. Therefore, Katie's suggestion appears to be incorrect.

## 4: Detailed Evaluation of Tom's Suggestion
Let's properly evaluate Tom's suggestion: If \( \frac{x-6}{2} = 10 \), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \( x - 6 = 20 \). Adding 6 to both sides gives \( x = 26 \). Then, \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \), not 16. So, Tom's line \( \frac{x}{2} = 16 \) does not correctly follow from \( \frac{x-6}{2} = 10 \).

## 5: Detailed Evaluation of Katie's Suggestion
For Katie's suggestion, \( x - 6 = 20 \) is the correct manipulation of \( \frac{x-6}{2} = 10 \), not \( x - 6 = 5 \). So, Katie is incorrect.

## 6: Identifying the Correct Approach
The correct manipulation from \( \frac{x-6}{2} = 10 \) is to multiply both sides by 2, yielding \( x - 6 = 20 \). This means neither Tom nor Katie provided a correct next step as described.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly solve the equation or understand the implications of Tom's and Katie's suggestions. Given the straightforward nature of the question, most might realize both suggestions are incorrect, but some might mistakenly validate one or both due to lack of understanding. A=20%, B=20%, C=10%, D=50%.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of algebra. They should see that multiplying by 2 or adding 6 and then dividing by 2 are standard steps. However, the direct evaluation of Tom's and Katie's steps might still confuse some. A=15%, B=15%, C=5%, D=65%.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students should easily identify that Tom's step results in \( \frac{x}{2} = 13 \), not 16, and Katie's step is \( x - 6 = 20 \), not 5. They are likely to correctly identify that neither suggestion matches the proper algebraic manipulation. A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will have a strong grasp of algebraic manipulations and should quickly dismiss both Tom's and Katie's suggestions as incorrect, recognizing the proper next step is \( x - 6 = 20 \). A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 8: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the predicted percentages for each ability level are as follows:

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=5% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
