## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to simplify the fraction \( \frac{13}{78} \) fully if possible. This involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 13 and 78 and dividing both the numerator and the denominator by this GCD.

## 2: Identifying the GCD of 13 and 78
The factors of 13 are 1 and 13 (since 13 is a prime number), and the factors of 78 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 13, 18, 26, 39, and 78. The greatest common factor of 13 and 78 is 13.

## 3: Simplifying the Fraction
To simplify \( \frac{13}{78} \), divide both the numerator and the denominator by 13:
\( \frac{13 \div 13}{78 \div 13} = \frac{1}{6} \).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
A common misconception might involve not simplifying the fraction or simplifying it incorrectly. However, given that 13 is a prime number and one of the factors of 78, the simplification to \( \frac{1}{6} \) is straightforward for students who understand basic fraction simplification.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand how to simplify fractions or might not recognize that 13 is a factor of 78. They might leave the fraction as is or try to simplify it incorrectly. Option D (Cannot be simplified) could be appealing to those who don't recognize the common factor. A=20% (incorrect simplification), B=10% (correct but let's see distribution), C=5% (unlikely), D=65% (not recognizing simplification).
- **Basic:** Students here should have a grasp of basic simplification. They might still make errors but are more likely to attempt simplification. B=60% (correct), A=20% (incorrect), C=5% (unlikely), D=15% (some might still not get it).
- **Proficient:** These students are expected to simplify the fraction correctly easily. B=85% (correct), A=5% (unlikely), C=2% (very unlikely), D=8% (a few might doubt their math).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only simplify correctly but also do so efficiently. B=95% (correct), A=2% (very unlikely), C=1% (extremely unlikely), D=2% (almost none).

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Based on the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=20%, B=10%, C=5%, D=65%
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=60%, C=5%, D=15%
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=85%, C=2%, D=8%
- **Advanced:** A=2%, B=95%, C=1%, D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
