To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 50.09 \div 0.1= \), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to division by decimals.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to divide 50.09 by 0.1. A key concept here is that dividing by 0.1 is equivalent to multiplying by 10.

## 2: Correct Calculation
To solve \( 50.09 \div 0.1 \), we can multiply 50.09 by 10, which equals 500.9.

## 3: Common Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect handling of decimal points during division or multiplication by powers of 10. However, this question specifically tests the understanding of dividing by a decimal, which can be tricky for some students.

## 4: Analyzing Options
- A: \( 50.009 \) suggests a misunderstanding of the operation or decimal shift.
- B: \( 500.9 \) is the correct answer.
- C: \( 500.09 \) could result from a miscalculation or incorrect decimal shift.
- D: \( 5.009 \) suggests an incorrect reduction.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic operations involving decimals. They might not fully understand the concept of dividing by 0.1 or multiplying by 10.
- A: 20% (misunderstanding of decimal shift)
- B: 40% (might understand the concept but struggle with calculation)
- C: 20% (confusion with decimal places)
- D: 20% (incorrect application of division)

### basic
Students at this level have a foundation but might still struggle with decimal operations.
- A: 10% (less likely to choose due to some understanding of decimals)
- B: 60% (understand the concept of multiplying by 10)
- C: 15% (might confuse with adding or incorrect shift)
- D: 15% (still some confusion)

### proficient
Students at this level are expected to handle decimal operations confidently.
- A: 5% (very few would make this mistake)
- B: 80% (most understand dividing by 0.1 equals multiplying by 10)
- C: 10% (some might still confuse operations)
- D: 5% (less likely due to better understanding)

### advanced
Students at this level are highly confident in their mathematical abilities.
- A: 0% (unlikely to choose incorrect options)
- B: 95% (clear understanding of the operation)
- C: 3% (minimal chance of misunderstanding)
- D: 2% (rare mistake)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
