To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Jo and Paul in relation to the equation \(2x = y\).

## Step 1: Analyze Jo's Statement
Jo claims that \(2x + 1 > y\) is always true. Given \(2x = y\), we can substitute \(y\) in Jo's statement with \(2x\), getting \(2x + 1 > 2x\). Simplifying this, we get \(1 > 0\), which is always true. Therefore, Jo's statement is correct.

## 2: Analyze Paul's Statement
Paul claims that \(-2x < y\) is always true. Substituting \(y = 2x\) into Paul's statement gives \(-2x < 2x\). This simplifies to \(0 < 4x\), or \(0 < x\). This statement is not always true because it depends on the value of \(x\). If \(x \leq 0\), then Paul's statement is false. Therefore, Paul's statement is not always true.

## 3: Determine the Correctness of Each Statement
- Jo's statement is always true.
- Paul's statement is not always true; it is only true for \(x > 0\).

## 4: Predict Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and understanding implications of equations. They might incorrectly assess the truth of statements without proper substitution or analysis. Given the straightforward nature of Jo's statement but the potential for confusion with Paul's, we might see:
  - A significant portion incorrectly identifying who is correct due to a lack of understanding of algebraic relationships.

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in logical deductions or algebraic manipulations. They are likely to understand Jo's statement but might be confused by Paul's, especially if they don't fully grasp the conditions under which Paul's statement holds.

- **Proficient:** These students should easily see that Jo's statement is always true through simple substitution. They might be more critical of Paul's statement, recognizing it's not universally true. However, the question's framing might still catch some off guard, especially if they misinterpret the conditions for \(x\).

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of algebraic concepts and logical reasoning. They should easily identify Jo as correct and recognize the conditional nature of Paul's statement, thus correctly concluding that only Jo is always correct.

## 5: Estimate Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (easy to see Jo's as true but might not evaluate Paul's correctly), B=20% (might see Paul's as universally true without conditions), C=20% (lack of understanding could lead to incorrect assessments), D=30% (could recognize neither as always true).
- **Basic:** A=50%, B=25%, C=15%, D=10% (as they start to grasp basic relationships but might still struggle with nuance).
- **Proficient:** A=70%, B=10%, C=5%, D=15% (stronger understanding but minor errors possible).
- **Advanced:** A=90%, B=5%, C=0%, D=5% (high level of understanding with minimal errors).

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
