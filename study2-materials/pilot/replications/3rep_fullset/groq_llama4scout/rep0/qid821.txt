## Step 1: Understand the question and the content it tests
The question requires students to simplify a given expression involving fractions and algebraic manipulation. The expression to simplify is \(\frac{2}{m^{2}-4 m+3} \times \frac{m-3}{4}\). This involves factoring the denominator of the first fraction, then multiplying the fractions.

## 2: Factor the denominator of the first fraction
The denominator \(m^{2}-4 m+3\) can be factored into \((m-3)(m-1)\). So, the expression becomes \(\frac{2}{(m-3)(m-1)} \times \frac{m-3}{4}\).

## 3: Simplify the expression
After factoring, we can simplify by cancelling out the \((m-3)\) from the numerator and the denominator, yielding \(\frac{2}{(m-1) \times 4}\). This simplifies further to \(\frac{1}{2(m-1)}\).

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions and errors
A common misconception might involve not fully simplifying the expression or incorrectly cancelling terms. However, the structure of this question, with the \((m-3)\) term present in both the numerator and denominator after factoring, makes it relatively straightforward to simplify correctly.

## 5: Evaluate the answer choices
- A: \(\frac{8}{m-1}\) implies incorrect simplification.
- B: \(\frac{1}{2(m-1)}\) is the correct simplification.
- C: \(\frac{2 m-6}{4 m^{2}-16 m+12}\) suggests not simplifying or incorrectly manipulating the expression.
- D: \(\frac{2}{m-1}\) is close but not fully simplified.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with algebraic manipulations and fraction simplifications. They might not correctly factor \(m^{2}-4m+3\) or might not cancel \((m-3)\) correctly, leading to a higher likelihood of choosing C (not simplifying) or A (incorrectly simplified).
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the basic concepts but could make careless mistakes. They might choose D for not fully simplifying or C for not cancelling terms correctly.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to factor and simplify correctly, likely choosing B. However, some might mistakenly choose D for a partially correct but not fully simplified answer.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should easily see the correct simplification to B and avoid common pitfalls.

## 7: Assign percentages
Given the nature of the question and common student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (incorrect but simple form), B=10% (correct but challenging), C=40% (no simplification), D=20% (partially correct).
- **Basic**: A=15%, B=60%, C=15%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=80%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=90%, C=0%, D=10%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
