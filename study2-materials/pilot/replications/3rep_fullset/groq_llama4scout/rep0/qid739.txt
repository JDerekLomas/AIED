To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing: the correct application of algebraic conventions, specifically the use of exponents to denote repeated multiplication.

The expression given is \(l \times 3 \times l \times l \times g \times g\). 

## Step 1: Understanding Algebraic Conventions
In algebra, when a variable is multiplied by itself multiple times, it is conventional to use exponents. For example, \(l \times l\) is written as \(l^2\), and \(l \times l \times l\) is written as \(l^3\). Similarly, \(g \times g\) is written as \(g^2\).

## 2: Applying Conventions to the Given Expression
The given expression can be simplified by applying these conventions:
\(l \times 3 \times l \times l \times g \times g = 3 \times l \times l \times l \times g \times g = 3l^3g^2\).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(l3llgg\) does not follow algebraic conventions correctly; it seems to suggest a concatenation rather than multiplication.
- Option B: \(l3l^2g^2\) incorrectly separates \(l\) and \(3\), suggesting they are not being multiplied together.
- Option C: \(3g^2l^3\) correctly represents \(3 \times g^2 \times l^3\), matching the algebraic convention for the given expression.
- Option D: \(3gg l^3\) suggests \(g \times g\) but does not use the exponent correctly for \(g\), and while it correctly places \(3\) and \(l^3\), it's not the standard way to write \(3g^2l^3\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic notation and the concept of exponents. They might choose A because it directly writes out each multiplication without applying any exponent rules, which could seem straightforward but incorrect. B might be chosen by those who understand some notation but not the full application. C would be correct but might be challenging for this group. D could be seen as correct by those understanding \(l^3\) but not \(g^2\). 
  - A: 40%, B: 20%, C: 20%, D: 20%
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding of algebra. They are more likely to recognize the use of exponents but might struggle with the order or complete application. 
  - A: 20%, B: 25%, C: 40%, D: 15%
- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with algebraic conventions and should easily identify the correct answer. 
  - A: 5%, B: 10%, C: 80%, D: 5%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very comfortable with algebra and should have no trouble. 
  - A: 0%, B: 5%, C: 90%, D: 5%
