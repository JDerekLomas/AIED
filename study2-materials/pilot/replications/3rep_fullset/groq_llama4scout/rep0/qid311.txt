## Step 1: Understand the question and the patterns
The question presents a sequence of patterns made from red squares and asks students to determine the correct method for counting the number of squares in Pattern 15, as proposed by Jo and Paul. The patterns consist of a rectangle with 3 squares high and \(n\) squares wide (where \(n\) increases by 1 for each subsequent pattern) and then 2 more squares, 1 each side of the middle squares.

## 2: Analyze Jo's method
Jo's method is \(15 \times 3 + 4\). To assess this, let's first try to understand the pattern: For any pattern \(n\), the number of squares in the rectangle part is \(3 \times n\), and then 2 additional squares are added. So, for Pattern \(n\), the total number of squares could be calculated as \(3n + 2\).

## 3: Analyze Paul's method
Paul's method is \((15 + 2) \times 3 - 4\). Let's simplify this to \(17 \times 3 - 4 = 51 - 4 = 47\).

## 4: Calculate the correct number of squares for Pattern 15
Using the general formula derived from understanding the pattern: For Pattern \(n\), the total squares \(= 3n + 2\). For Pattern 15, total squares \(= 3 \times 15 + 2 = 45 + 2 = 47\).

## 5: Evaluate Jo's method for Pattern 15
Jo's method for Pattern 15: \(15 \times 3 + 4 = 45 + 4 = 49\). This does not match the correct calculation of 47 squares.

## 6: Evaluate Paul's method for Pattern 15
Paul's method for Pattern 15: \((15 + 2) \times 3 - 4 = 17 \times 3 - 4 = 51 - 4 = 47\). This matches the correct calculation.

## 7: Determine the correctness of Jo and Paul's methods
Jo's method yields 49 squares, and Paul's method yields 47 squares. The correct number of squares in Pattern 15 is 47. Thus, only Paul is correct.

## 8: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic expressions and pattern recognition. They might incorrectly apply or understand the formulas. Given the simplicity of calculations but complexity of understanding the pattern, they might be more likely to guess or apply incorrect methods. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 40\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 30\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make errors in application. They might calculate Jo's method correctly but not realize it's incorrect or might not compute Paul's correctly. \(A = 30\%\), \(B = 50\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 15\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the pattern and can apply algebraic expressions. They are likely to correctly evaluate both methods. \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 80\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the algebraic representation but can also critically evaluate the methods. They are likely to find both Jo and Paul's mistakes or confirmations easily. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 90\%\), \(C = 0\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=50% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=0% D=5%
