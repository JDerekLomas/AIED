To approach this question, let's consider the key concepts involved: lines of symmetry in basic shapes and composite shapes. A line of symmetry is an imaginary line that divides a shape into two identical parts that are mirror images of each other.

## Step 1: Understanding the Shape
The given shape is a rectangle divided into 3 equal horizontal sections, with the middle section being white and the other two being blue. In the center of the white section, there are five blue stars arranged like the dots on a dice. The stars are all oriented the same way, with one point pointing directly upwards.

## 2: Identifying Potential Lines of Symmetry
- The rectangle itself has 2 lines of symmetry: one vertical line down the middle and one horizontal line across the middle.
- The arrangement of the blue and white sections (2 blue sections and 1 white section) does not add any lines of symmetry on its own since it's not symmetrical about any vertical or horizontal line that would divide it into identical parts.
- The five blue stars in the middle section could potentially have lines of symmetry, but their arrangement (like a dice) has a line of symmetry through the middle star (vertically) and possibly through the arrangement of the stars, but not horizontally due to their specific orientation.

## 3: Analyzing the Stars for Symmetry
The arrangement of the five stars resembles a dice face with 5 dots. This pattern has a vertical line of symmetry (through the center dot and the space between the two dots on either side) but does not have a horizontal line of symmetry due to the orientation of the stars and their positioning.

## 4: Combining Elements for Overall Symmetry
The entire shape's symmetry will be influenced by both the colored sections and the star arrangement. The vertical line through the middle of the rectangle (and thus through the center of the white section with the stars) could potentially be a line of symmetry if the stars' arrangement is symmetrical about it, which it is. However, there's no horizontal line of symmetry due to the unequal division of the rectangle by color and the specific orientation and arrangement of the stars.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding what a line of symmetry is. They might not recognize the symmetry in the stars or the rectangle. Option A (0 lines) might seem plausible because they might not see any symmetry, leading to A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding of shapes and might recognize the rectangle's symmetry but struggle with the composite shape. They might see the vertical line through the middle as a line of symmetry, leading to A=30%, B=40%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand symmetry well and can apply it to various shapes. They should recognize the vertical line of symmetry through the middle of the rectangle and the stars, leading to A=10%, B=60%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of symmetry and can easily identify lines of symmetry in complex shapes. They will quickly see the vertical line of symmetry, leading to A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.

The best answer is below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
