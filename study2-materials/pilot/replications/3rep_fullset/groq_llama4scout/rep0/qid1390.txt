To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or challenges students might face.

The question requires the application of the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). The correct calculation following this order is:

1. Multiply \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{3} \): \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6} \)
2. Add \( \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \frac{1}{6} \): To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 6. So, \( \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6} \). Then, \( \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \)

So, the correct answer is \( \frac{1}{2} \), which corresponds to option A.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question is \( \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \). To solve it, one must follow the order of operations.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to add the fractions first or to misunderstand the order of operations, leading to incorrect calculations such as \( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} \) without properly finding a common denominator for the addition step or incorrectly calculating the multiplication.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( \frac{1}{2} \) (Correct answer)
- Option B: \( \frac{5}{18} \)
- Option C: \( \frac{2}{9} \)
- Option D: \( \frac{1}{15} \)

Let's calculate what students might get if they follow incorrect procedures:
- Incorrectly solving: \( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \) (Actually correct, but let's assume some get it through wrong methods).
- Another mistake could be \( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{9} \) if they incorrectly find a common denominator or perform operations.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the order of operations or struggle with basic fraction arithmetic. They might choose any option randomly or based on a very superficial understanding. Let's assume A=20% (guessing the obviously correct looking answer), B=20%, C=30%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to get it right or make simple calculation errors. So, A=50%, B=25%, C=20%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and are likely to apply them correctly but might make minor errors under pressure. So, A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident and accurate in their calculations. They are likely to get it right. So, A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
