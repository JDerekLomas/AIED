To approach this question, let's first analyze the steps given and determine their validity.

The equation provided is:
\[27 = 9(1 + k)\]

## Step 1: Validate Step 1
To validate Step 1, we divide both sides of the equation by 9:
\[27 / 9 = 9(1 + k) / 9\]
\[3 = 1 + k\]
So, Step 1 is correct.

## Step 2: Validate Step 2
For Step 2, we solve for \(k\):
\[3 = 1 + k\]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[3 - 1 = k\]
\[2 = k\]
So, Step 2 is also correct.

Given that both steps are correct, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly validate steps or fail to see the correctness of both steps.
  - A: Only step 1 (15%)
  - B: Only step 2 (10%)
  - C: Both steps are correct (20%)
  - D: Both steps are incorrect (55%)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might make simple mistakes. They are more likely to identify correct steps but could be tricked by the simplicity of the equation.
  - A: Only step 1 (5%)
  - B: Only step 2 (5%)
  - C: Both steps are correct (70%)
  - D: Both steps are incorrect (20%)

- **Proficient**: Students at this level are expected to accurately solve and validate algebraic steps. They should easily identify both steps as correct.
  - A: Only step 1 (2%)
  - B: Only step 2 (2%)
  - C: Both steps are correct (90%)
  - D: Both steps are incorrect (6%)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only solve equations correctly but also understand the underlying concepts deeply. They are highly likely to identify both steps as correct.
  - A: Only step 1 (1%)
  - B: Only step 2 (1%)
  - C: Both steps are correct (95%)
  - D: Both steps are incorrect (3%)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=20% D=55%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=70% D=20%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
