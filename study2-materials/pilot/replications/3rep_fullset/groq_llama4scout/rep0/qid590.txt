To approach this question, let's consider what makes it easy or hard for students at different ability levels. The question tests the knowledge of basic mathematical instruments and their uses. 

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not have a strong grasp of mathematical tools or might not have been exposed to them. There's a possibility that they could confuse the tools or not know what is used for constructing circles. 
  - A: Callipers (used for measuring widths or thicknesses) might be confused with something used for drawing, but it's less likely to be chosen for constructing circles.
  - B: Compass (the tool used for drawing circles and arcs) is the correct answer but might not be well-known.
  - C: Protractor (used for measuring angles) could be mistakenly chosen if students think it's used for constructing shapes.
  - D: Slide rule (an old tool for calculations) is unlikely to be chosen for constructing circles.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of math tools. They are more likely to know the basic instruments but might make simple mistakes.
  - A: Callipers might still be a confusing choice but less likely.
  - B: Compass is likely to be known and chosen correctly by a significant portion.
  - C: Protractor might still cause confusion, especially if students have used it to draw angles and mistakenly think it's for constructing circles.
  - D: Slide rule is less relevant to geometry constructions.

- **Proficient:** Students at this level have a solid understanding of mathematical concepts and tools. They are less likely to confuse these instruments.
  - A: Callipers - unlikely to be chosen.
  - B: Compass - likely to be chosen correctly.
  - C: Protractor - less likely to be chosen for constructing circles.
  - D: Slide rule - unlikely to be chosen.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have an in-depth understanding and are unlikely to make mistakes about basic tools and their uses.
  - A: Callipers - very unlikely.
  - B: Compass - very likely to be chosen correctly.
  - C: Protractor - unlikely to be chosen.
  - D: Slide rule - very unlikely.

Given these considerations, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%

These predictions assume that most students, even at lower levels, have some exposure to these tools, but the ability to accurately choose the correct tool for constructing circles improves with higher ability levels.
