To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question involves multiplying two terms from the expansion of the brackets \((x-8)(x-2)\), specifically the terms \(-8\) and \(-2\). The correct mathematical operation here is multiplying \(-8\) by \(-2\), which equals \(16\). This operation is fundamental and typically straightforward.

## Step 1: Understanding the Mathematical Concept
The mathematical concept being tested is the multiplication of two negative numbers, which results in a positive number. Specifically, \(-8 \times -2 = 16\).

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be that students forget that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. However, the question directly points to the terms \(-8\) and \(-2\) and asks for their product, making it relatively straightforward.

## 3: Evaluating the Question's Difficulty
Given that the question explicitly points to the terms and asks for their product, it does not rely on the full expansion of \((x-8)(x-2)\) but rather on a simple multiplication fact. This simplicity makes it less likely for students to make errors based on misconceptions about bracket expansion and more about the basic arithmetic.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations, including multiplication of negative numbers. They might choose \(A = -10\) (incorrect), \(C = -6\) (incorrect), or \(D = -16\) (incorrect) due to errors in handling negative numbers or basic multiplication facts. \(B = +16\) seems the most likely correct answer but might be challenging for some. Prediction: \(A=30\%\) \(B=40\%\) \(C=15\%\) \(D=15\%\).
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a solid grasp of basic arithmetic. They are likely to get the multiplication of \(-8\) and \(-2\) correct. Prediction: \(A=10\%\) \(B=80\%\) \(C=5\%\) \(D=5\%\).
- **Proficient:** These students have a strong understanding of algebraic concepts, including the multiplication of negative numbers. They should easily get this correct. Prediction: \(A=5\%\) \(B=90\%\) \(C=2.5\%\) \(D=2.5\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts easily. They should all get this correct. Prediction: \(A=0\%\) \(B=95\%\) \(C=2.5\%\) \(D=2.5\%\).

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the question, most students should be able to select the correct answer, \(B = +16\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2.5% D=2.5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2.5% D=2.5%
