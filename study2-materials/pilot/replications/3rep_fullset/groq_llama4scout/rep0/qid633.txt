To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or understanding related to solving quadratic equations.

The equation given is \((d+3)^{2}-25=0\). A correct next step to solve this equation would involve isolating the squared term, which is already done in Step 1: \((d+3)^{2}=25\). The next correct step would be to take the square root of both sides, remembering to consider both the positive and negative square roots.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Solution
The correct solution after \((d+3)^{2}=25\) is to take the square root of both sides, which leads to \(d+3 = \pm5\). This means the correct answer is D) \(d+3 = \pm5\).

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
- Option A) \(d+3=5\) suggests ignoring the negative square root, a common mistake.
- Option B) \(d+3=12.5\) seems to come from incorrectly solving for \(d+3\) and might reflect confusion or a calculation error.
- Option C) \(d^{2}=22\) does not logically follow from the given step and seems unrelated to the immediate next steps in solving the equation.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and understanding of square roots. They might be more likely to make errors in calculation or in understanding the steps to solve an equation.
  - A: 30% (some students might stop at the positive root)
  - B: 20% (potential for calculation errors or misinterpretation)
  - C: 20% (unrelated step, possible confusion)
  - D: 30% (some might understand the need for \(\pm\))

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still fall into common traps.
  - A: 20% (less likely to ignore negative roots compared to below basic)
  - B: 10% (less calculation error, more understanding of direct solutions)
  - C: 10% (less confusion about unrelated steps)
  - D: 60% (better understanding of \(\pm\) requirement)

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebraic techniques.
  - A: 5% (unlikely to ignore negative roots)
  - B: 5% (less likely to make calculation errors leading to this)
  - C: 5% (understand the correct sequence)
  - D: 85% (strong understanding of solving quadratic equations)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are adept at solving equations and understanding the implications of their steps.
  - A: 0% (unlikely to make simple mistakes)
  - B: 0% (calculation errors are rare)
  - C: 0% (clear understanding of sequence)
  - D: 100% (confident in applying \(\pm\) correctly)

## 4: Conclusion
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **basic:** A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
