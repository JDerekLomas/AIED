## Step 1: Understand the question and the ratio
The question provides a ratio of gold coins shared by Percy, Quentin, and Robbie as 3:7:8. It also states that Percy gets 36 fewer coins than Quentin. We need to determine how many gold coins Robbie gets.

## 2: Express the ratio in terms of a variable
Let's denote the multiplier for the ratio as \(x\). Therefore, Percy gets \(3x\) coins, Quentin gets \(7x\) coins, and Robbie gets \(8x\) coins.

## 3: Use the given information to solve for \(x\)
We are told Percy gets 36 fewer coins than Quentin. This can be written as \(7x - 3x = 36\). Simplifying this equation gives \(4x = 36\).

## 4: Solve for \(x\)
Dividing both sides of the equation \(4x = 36\) by 4 gives \(x = 9\).

## 5: Calculate the number of coins Robbie gets
Using \(x = 9\), Robbie gets \(8x = 8 \times 9 = 72\) coins.

## 6: Analyze the difficulty of the question
This question tests the application of ratios and the ability to translate a word problem into an algebraic equation. The key information that Percy gets 36 fewer coins than Quentin directly relates to the difference in their ratio parts (7 - 3 = 4 parts), which might help students verify their approach.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with setting up the equation or understanding the ratio. They might not correctly identify \(4x = 36\), or they might not know how to solve for \(x\). Given the straightforward nature of solving for \(x\) and then finding Robbie's coins, but considering potential miscalculations or incorrect applications of the ratio, we might see a spread but potentially more errors. A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40% seems plausible but let's refine.
- **Basic**: These students can solve simple equations and understand ratios. They might make errors in calculation or setting up the equation but should be able to get it right with careful work. Expect a higher percentage on the correct answer. A=5% B=70% C=10% D=15%.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should easily solve the problem. The correct answer should be very appealing. A=2% B=90% C=3% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students not only solve it correctly but might also verify their answers. The question seems straightforward, so we expect a high success rate. A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%.

## 8: Adjust predictions based on common misconceptions and calculation errors
Given that the solution involves straightforward algebra and ratio application, common misconceptions might include incorrect calculation of \(x\) or misapplication of the ratio. However, the difference of 36 coins directly corresponds to 4 parts of the ratio, making \(x = 9\) straightforward to find.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=5% B=15% C=20% D=60%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=90% C=3% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
