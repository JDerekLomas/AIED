To solve this, let's first calculate the area of the shaded section.

## Step 1: Calculate the dimensions and area of each rectangle
The total base of the composite shape is 13cm, and the horizontal width of the top part is 6cm. This implies the base of the bottom rectangle is 13 - 6 = 7cm. The vertical height of the whole shape is 14cm, and the vertical height of the top rectangle is 8cm, meaning the vertical height of the bottom rectangle is 14 - 8 = 6cm.

## 2: Calculate the area of each rectangle
- The area of the top rectangle (which is shaded) is \(6 \times 8 = 48 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\).
- To find the area of the unshaded rectangle, we use its base (7cm) and height (6cm): \(7 \times 6 = 42 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\).

## 3: Calculate the area of the shaded section
The area of the shaded section can be found directly since we know it's a rectangle: \(6 \times 8 = 48 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\).

## 4: Analyze the question for potential misconceptions
The question might trigger misconceptions if students incorrectly calculate the areas or mistakenly try to subtract the areas of the rectangles. However, given the straightforward dimensions, most students should be able to calculate the shaded area directly.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with calculating areas or understanding the geometry. They might incorrectly add or subtract dimensions or areas. Option A seems directly related to the top rectangle, so they might choose this without calculation. \(A=40\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=20\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here should understand area calculations but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. \(A=60\%\), \(B=15\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=15\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately calculate the area of the shaded part. \(A=80\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=10\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only calculate accurately but also understand that the question directly provides necessary measurements for the shaded area. \(A=90\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=0\%\), \(D=10\%\).

The best answer is A. 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
