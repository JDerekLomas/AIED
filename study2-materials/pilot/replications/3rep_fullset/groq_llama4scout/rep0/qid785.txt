To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the sum of interior angles of an irregular pentagon, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The formula to calculate the sum of interior angles in a polygon is \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \(n = 5\), so the sum of interior angles is \((5-2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception is that all polygons have interior angles that sum to \(360^\circ\), which is actually true for quadrilaterals (or 4-sided shapes) but not for polygons with more or fewer sides. This might lead some students to choose option A (\(360^\circ\)).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A (\(360^{\circ}\)) is incorrect for a pentagon but might be chosen by students who mistakenly apply the quadrilateral rule.
- Option B (\(540^{\circ}\)) is the correct answer, based on the formula for a pentagon.
- Option C (\(720^{\circ}\)) would be the sum for a hexagon (6-sided shape), so it's incorrect for a pentagon.
- Option D (Not enough information to work it out) is also incorrect because the sum of interior angles can be determined for any polygon if you know the number of sides, which is given (a pentagon has 5 sides).

## 3: Assessing Difficulty by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand the concept or might confuse it with the sum of exterior angles or the properties of specific shapes like quadrilaterals. They might choose A (\(360^{\circ}\)) due to confusion or lack of understanding. **A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%**
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors. They're more likely to recognize the pentagon and attempt to apply a formula or rule, but might not calculate it correctly or might still confuse it with \(360^\circ\). **A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%**
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to know the formula and apply it correctly. Mistakes are less likely, but some might still miscalculate. **A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%**
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly likely to get it right, understanding the formula and its application well. **A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%**

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
