To approach this question, let's first solve the equation and then consider the potential misconceptions or difficulties students at different levels might face.

The equation to solve is:
\[20t - 5 = 5t + 10\]

## Step 1: Rearrange the equation to isolate terms with \(t\) on one side.
Subtract \(5t\) from both sides:
\[20t - 5t - 5 = 5t - 5t + 10\]
This simplifies to:
\[15t - 5 = 10\]

## 2: Add 5 to both sides to further isolate terms with \(t\).
\[15t - 5 + 5 = 10 + 5\]
This simplifies to:
\[15t = 15\]

## 3: Solve for \(t\).
Divide both sides by 15:
\[t = \frac{15}{15}\]
\[t = 1\]

So, the correct answer is \(t = 1\), which corresponds to option B.

## 4: Consider potential student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly rearrange the equation or make simple arithmetic mistakes. Given the simplicity of the numbers involved and the straightforward nature of the algebraic steps, a significant portion might still stumble upon the correct answer by trial and error or simple guesswork, but errors will be common.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes or not fully understand the steps involved. They are more likely to get the correct answer than those below basic but might still struggle with ensuring each step is correct.
- **Proficient:** These students understand algebra well and can solve equations like this with ease. They are less likely to make mistakes in solving the equation.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and can solve such equations quickly and accurately. They might not even see this as a challenging question.

## 5: Predicting student responses.
Given the equation and solution:
- The correct answer is B (\(t = 1\)).
- A common mistake could involve not isolating \(t\) correctly or making a calculation error.

## 6: Estimating percentages.
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (some might incorrectly guess or not solve it), B=40% (might get it through guesswork or simple trial), C=15% (incorrectly solving), D=25% (another incorrect guess).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=70%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** A=2%, B=95%, C=2%, D=1%.

The best answer is B. 

Below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
