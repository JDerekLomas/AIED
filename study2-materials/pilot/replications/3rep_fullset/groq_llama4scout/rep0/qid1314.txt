To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question asks for a common multiple of \(4, 6,\) and \(12\). A common multiple is a number that is a multiple of all the given numbers. The least common multiple (LCM) of \(4, 6,\) and \(12\) is \(12\), as \(12\) can be divided evenly by \(4, 6,\) and \(12\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept
Students need to understand what a common multiple is and how to find it. The LCM of \(4, 6,\) and \(12\) is \(12\), which means any multiple of \(12\) is also a common multiple.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(2\) is a factor of \(4, 6,\) and \(12\), not a multiple.
- Option B: \(12\) is the LCM of \(4, 6,\) and \(12\), making it a common multiple.
- Option C: \(18\) is not a multiple of \(4\) or \(12\), only of \(6\).
- Option D: \(20\) is not a multiple of \(6\) or \(12\), only of \(4\).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with understanding what a multiple is. They might choose \(2\) because it's a small number related to all three, or they might not understand the concept of a common multiple. \(A=40\%, B=30\%, C=15\%, D=15\%\)
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of multiples and factors. They should recognize \(12\) as a correct answer but might be confused by other options. \(A=10\%, B=70\%, C=10\%, D=10\%\)
- **Proficient**: Students here should easily identify \(12\) as a common multiple. \(A=5\%, B=90\%, C=3\%, D=2\%\)
- **Advanced**: These students not only know the correct answer but can also explain why it's correct. They might quickly eliminate incorrect options. \(A=0\%, B=95\%, C=2\%, D=3\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2% D=3%
