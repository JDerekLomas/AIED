## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question tests the factorization of a quadratic equation and the understanding of how the coefficients of the quadratic equation relate to its factors. The equation given is \(m^{2}+5m-14 \equiv(m+a)(m+b)\). To factorize \(m^{2}+5m-14\), one needs to find two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to 5. These numbers are 7 and -2 because \(7 \times (-2) = -14\) and \(7 + (-2) = 5\). Thus, \(m^{2}+5m-14 = (m+7)(m-2)\), implying \(a=7\) and \(b=-2\).

## 2: Determine the correct answer.
Given \(a=7\) and \(b=-2\), \(a \times b = 7 \times (-2) = -14\). So, the correct answer is D: \(-14\).

## 3: Analyze the potential for misconceptions.
A common misconception could be incorrectly identifying \(a\) and \(b\) or miscalculating their product. Students might confuse the signs or the values of \(a\) and \(b\), or they might not fully understand how to factor the quadratic equation.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and factorization. They might not correctly factor \(m^{2}+5m-14\) or might confuse the relationship between the factors and the product \(a \times b\). Expect a high level of incorrect responses.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebra but might make simple mistakes in factorization or in calculating \(a \times b\). They are more likely to recognize the need to factor but might not always get \(a\) and \(b\) correct.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students should be able to factor \(m^{2}+5m-14\) correctly into \((m+7)(m-2)\), identifying \(a=7\) and \(b=-2\), and then calculate \(a \times b = -14\) correctly.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to not only factor the equation correctly but also understand the implications of their factorization, making it unlikely for them to choose incorrect options.

## 5: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level.
Given the nature of the question, even students who are not highly advanced might still be able to factor the quadratic and compute \(a \times b\) correctly, as the numbers involved are relatively straightforward.

- **Below Basic:** A=30% (guessing or incorrect expansion), B=20% (another incorrect guess), C=20% (mistaking the product for the constant term), D=30% (correct or lucky guess).
- **Basic:** A=10% (simple mistake), B=5% (unlikely but possible mistake), C=15% (confusing with addition or another operation), D=70% (correct factorization and calculation).
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85% (accurately factorizing and calculating \(a \times b\)).
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (no errors in factorization or calculation).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=15% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
