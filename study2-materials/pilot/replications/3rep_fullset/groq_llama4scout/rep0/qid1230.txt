## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a compound shape made of two rectangles with various sides labeled: \( p \) cm, 10 cm, 7 cm, 3 cm, and 4 cm. One side is unlabelled. The task is to find the value of \( p \).

## 2: Analyzing the Compound Shape
To solve for \( p \), we need to understand the relationships between the sides of the rectangles. Given that one side is unlabelled but can be inferred to be part of the rectangles, we look for relationships that can help us determine \( p \).

## 3: Identifying Relevant Relationships
The shape can be divided into two rectangles. One rectangle has sides labeled 10 cm and 3 cm (or 4 cm and \( p \) cm, depending on the orientation). The other has sides 7 cm and 4 cm. However, to find \( p \), we must recognize that the side lengths given must match up to form complete rectangles.

## 4: Solving for \( p \)
Given the sides, if we consider the rectangle with sides 10 cm and 7 cm (which seems to be a combination of the given lengths to form a larger rectangle), we notice:
- One part of the shape has sides 3 cm and 10 cm.
- The other part has sides 4 cm and 7 cm.

But to directly solve for \( p \), notice that \( p \) and 4 cm must be opposite sides of one rectangle, and 3 cm and 7 cm do not directly help with \( p \) without considering the full shape's dimensions.

## 5: Applying Geometric Principles
The total width of the combined shape is 10 cm (from one rectangle) and the heights of the rectangles are 3 cm and 4 cm. For the sides to match up:
- The 7 cm side must match with \( p \) and 3 cm to form a coherent shape.

However, considering standard rectangle properties, we see:
- A rectangle with sides 7 cm and 3 cm.
- And another with 10 cm and 4 cm.

## 6: Direct Calculation
Considering the dimensions:
- If the larger rectangle is 10 cm by 4 cm, and the smaller one is 7 cm by 3 cm, we directly see \( p = 7 - 4 = 3 \) cm or through similar logic.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle to understand the geometric relationships. They might guess randomly or think \( p \) could be any of the numbers given (A=30%, B=30%, C=20%, D=20%).
- **Basic**: Students might recognize the need for matching sides but could get confused. They might think \( p \) relates directly to simple addition/subtraction of given numbers without understanding the geometric fit (A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%).
- **Proficient**: These students understand geometric relationships and can solve for \( p \) by recognizing the sides that must match. They'd likely find \( p = 3 \) cm (A=10%, B=70%, C=10%, D=10%).
- **Advanced**: Students would quickly and accurately solve for \( p \) with confidence in their geometric understanding. The correct answer, \( p = 3 \) cm, would be chosen by most (A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%).

## 8: Conclusion
The question requires understanding of geometric shapes and their properties. Most students, especially those proficient or advanced, should recognize \( p \) as 3 cm.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=50% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
