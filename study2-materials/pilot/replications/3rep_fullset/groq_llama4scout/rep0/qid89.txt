To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question asks for the first term of a sequence given by the rule \(1 - 5n\). To find the first term, we need to substitute \(n = 1\) into the formula because, by convention, \(n\) starts at 1 for sequences unless otherwise specified.

## Step 1: Calculate the First Term
Substitute \(n = 1\) into the rule \(1 - 5n\):
\[1 - 5(1) = 1 - 5 = -4\]

## 2: Identify the Correct Answer
The correct answer is \(D) -4\), as calculated.

## 3: Analyze Potential Misconceptions and Student Understanding
- **Misconception:** A common misconception might be substituting \(n = 0\) instead of \(n = 1\), which would yield \(1 - 5(0) = 1\), corresponding to option \(A\).
- **Understanding:** Students need to understand that \(n\) typically starts at 1 for sequences and apply the formula correctly.

## 4: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand sequence notation or might incorrectly substitute \(n = 0\). They might also struggle with simple algebraic expressions.
  - \(A = 60\%\) (incorrectly using \(n = 0\))
  - \(B = 20\%\) (random or incorrect calculation)
  - \(C = 10\%\) (random guess)
  - \(D = 10\%\) (correct, but struggling)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple mistakes.
  - \(A = 30\%\) (using \(n = 0\))
  - \(B = 10\%\) (misinterpreting the formula)
  - \(C = 5\%\) (random guess)
  - \(D = 55\%\) (correct)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the sequence and algebraic expressions well.
  - \(A = 10\%\) (careless mistake)
  - \(B = 5\%\) (unlikely but possible mistake)
  - \(C = 0\%\) (unlikely guess)
  - \(D = 85\%\) (correct)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident and accurate.
  - \(A = 0\%\) (unlikely)
  - \(B = 0\%\) (unlikely)
  - \(C = 0\%\) (unlikely)
  - \(D = 100\%\) (correct)

The best answer is D. 

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=5% D=55%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=0% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
