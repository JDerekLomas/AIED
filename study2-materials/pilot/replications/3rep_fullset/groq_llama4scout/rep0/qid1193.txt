To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question presents a straightforward scenario of a straight line split into two angles, \(a\) and \(b\), and asks for the sum of these angles. The correct answer is based on the basic property that the angles on a straight line add up to \(180^{\circ}\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question is about recognizing that two angles forming a straight line sum to \(180^{\circ}\). This is a fundamental concept in geometry.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be that angles on a straight line add up to \(90^{\circ}\) (which would be correct for complementary angles but not for angles on a straight line) or \(360^{\circ}\) (which is the sum of angles around a point).

## 3: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \(180^{\circ}\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(100^{\circ}\) seems arbitrary and incorrect without further context.
- Option C: \(360^{\circ}\) could be a misconception related to the sum of angles around a point, not on a line.
- Option D: \(90^{\circ}\) might reflect a misunderstanding related to right angles or complementary angles.

## 4: Predictions by Ability Level
### Below_Basic
At this level, students might struggle with basic geometric concepts. The correct answer, \(180^{\circ}\), might not be immediately recognizable.
- A: \(40\%\) (some might recall basic facts)
- B: \(20\%\) (arbitrary guess)
- C: \(30\%\) (misconception about angles around a point)
- D: \(10\%\) (less likely, but could confuse with right angles)

### Basic
Students at this level have a grasp of basic geometry but might still make simple mistakes.
- A: \(60\%\) (most would know this)
- B: \(15\%\) (some random guessing)
- C: \(15\%\) (some hold onto misconceptions)
- D: \(10\%\) (still some confusion with basic angle facts)

### Proficient
Proficient students are expected to have a solid understanding of geometric principles.
- A: \(85\%\) (strong understanding of angle sums)
- B: \(5\%\) (little random guessing)
- C: \(5\%\) (occasional slip with misconceptions)
- D: \(5\%\) (rarely confuse with other basic concepts)

### Advanced
Advanced students have a deep and flexible understanding of geometry.
- A: \(95\%\) (very confident in basic geometric facts)
- B: \(0\%\) (unlikely to guess randomly)
- C: \(3\%\) (rarely, if ever, would confuse with \(360^{\circ}\))
- D: \(2\%\) (extremely rare confusion)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%
