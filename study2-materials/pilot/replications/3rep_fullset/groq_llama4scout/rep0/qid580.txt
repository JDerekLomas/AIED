To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the strategies proposed by Tom and Katie for calculating \(59 \times 4\) mentally and assess their correctness.

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Strategy
Tom doubles \(59\) and then doubles the answer. Doubling \(59\) gives \(118\), and doubling \(118\) gives \(236\). The correct calculation for \(59 \times 4\) is \(59 \times 4 = 236\), so Tom's method actually yields the correct answer because \(59 \times 4 = (59 \times 2) \times 2 = 118 \times 2 = 236\).

## 2: Analyze Katie's Strategy
Katie does \(60 \times 4\) and then subtracts \(4\) from the answer. Calculating \(60 \times 4\) gives \(240\), and subtracting \(4\) gives \(236\). This matches the correct result for \(59 \times 4\), so Katie's method is also correct because \(60 \times 4 - 4 = (59 + 1) \times 4 - 4 = 59 \times 4 + 1 \times 4 - 4 = 59 \times 4\).

## 3: Evaluate the Difficulty of the Question
Given that both Tom and Katie's methods yield the correct answer, the question is not testing a misconception directly but rather understanding of multiplication properties. The potential misconception here could be about the distributive property or doubling/halving strategies, but in this case, both strategies are sound.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts and strategies for mental math. They might not accurately apply either strategy or understand the properties of multiplication. Thus, they might be more likely to choose incorrect options or not understand the question. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 40\%\), \(D = 20\%\)
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic multiplication but might not be as fluent with mental math strategies or properties of numbers. They are likely to understand both methods are correct. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 80\%\), \(D = 10\%\)
- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with multiplication and understand various strategies. They will easily see that both Tom and Katie are correct. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 90\%\), \(D = 10\%\)
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the strategies but can also explain why they work. They will confidently choose the correct answer. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 95\%\), \(D = 5\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
