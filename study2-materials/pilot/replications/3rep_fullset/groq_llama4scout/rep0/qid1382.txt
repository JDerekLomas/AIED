To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \frac{5}{7}-\frac{1}{4} \), let's consider the common misconceptions and the difficulty level of this specific question.

## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question requires students to subtract two fractions, \( \frac{5}{7} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \), and then simplify the result if necessary. The correct approach involves finding a common denominator, subtracting the numerators, and then simplifying the fraction if possible.

## 2: Identify Common Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve directly subtracting the numerators and denominators without finding a common denominator, or incorrectly simplifying the fraction. However, given that the denominators are 7 and 4, which are relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 1), the common denominator is simply 28, making the calculation straightforward: \( \frac{5}{7} = \frac{5 \times 4}{7 \times 4} = \frac{20}{28} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1 \times 7}{4 \times 7} = \frac{7}{28} \). The subtraction then is \( \frac{20}{28} - \frac{7}{28} = \frac{13}{28} \).

## 3: Analyze Option Choices
- Option A: \( \frac{27}{28} \) seems plausible for students who might add instead of subtract or make a calculation error.
- Option B: \( \frac{4}{3} \) seems highly unlikely as it doesn't relate directly to the fractions given and would require a significant miscalculation.
- Option C: \( \frac{13}{28} \) is the correct answer.
- Option D: \( \frac{1}{7} \) could be a result of a student incorrectly simplifying or calculating.

## 4: Ability Level Predictions
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with finding a common denominator or performing the subtraction correctly. They might opt for simple or incorrect operations: A=20% (guessing or incorrect calculation), B=10% (unrelated, possibly due to a significant mistake), C=40% (some might get it through luck or simple trial and error), D=30% (incorrect simplification).
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding but might still make errors in calculations or finding the common denominator: A=15%, B=5%, C=70%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to understand fractions well and calculate accurately: A=5%, B=2%, C=90%, D=3%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to get the question correct with ease and might not even consider incorrect options: A=2%, B=1%, C=96%, D=1%.

## 5: Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
- basic: A=15% B=5% C=70% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
- advanced: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=5% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%
