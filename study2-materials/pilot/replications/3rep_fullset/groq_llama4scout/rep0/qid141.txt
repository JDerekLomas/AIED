## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question tests the understanding of the equation \( y = x^2 - 1 \) and the ability to solve for \( x \) given \( y \). The specific misconception here involves understanding that \( x^2 \) will always yield a positive result (or zero), and thus \( x \) can have two values (positive and negative) for a given positive \( y \) (when \( y > -1 \)).

## 2: Analyze the given values and the equation.
Given \( y = 15 \), we substitute \( y \) in the equation \( y = x^2 - 1 \) to find \( x \):
\[ 15 = x^2 - 1 \]
\[ 16 = x^2 \]
\[ x = \pm 4 \]
So, \( x \) could indeed be \( 4 \) or \( -4 \) when \( y = 15 \).

## 3: Consider the difficulty level for students at different abilities.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting values into the equation and solving for \( x \). They might not correctly solve the quadratic equation or might not understand the concept of \( x \) having two solutions.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to substitute \( y = 15 \) into the equation and solve for \( x^2 = 16 \), leading to \( x = \pm 4 \). However, they might need to be careful and ensure they consider both the positive and negative roots.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve for \( x \) and understand that both \( 4 \) and \( -4 \) are valid solutions for \( x \) when \( y = 15 \).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will not only solve the equation correctly but also quickly recognize that both Tom and Katie are correct due to the nature of quadratic equations having two solutions.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option.
- **Below Basic**: 
  - A (Only Tom): 20% (some might only consider the positive root)
  - B (Only Katie): 20% (others might only consider the negative root)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 30% (a few might intuitively understand both are correct)
  - D (Neither is correct): 30% (many might not solve it correctly or understand the concept)

- **Basic**: 
  - A: 10%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 70% (most will solve it and see both are correct)
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient**: 
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 85% (most will easily see both solutions)
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: 
  - A: 0%
  - B: 0%
  - C: 95% (will quickly and confidently identify both as correct)
  - D: 5%

## 5: Convert predictions into the required format.
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
