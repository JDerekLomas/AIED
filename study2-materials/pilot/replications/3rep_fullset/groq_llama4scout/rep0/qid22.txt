To approach this question, let's analyze the calculations and the misconception they are testing.

Tom's statement: If \(3748 + 426 = 4174\), then \(3748 + 427\) must equal \(4175\).

This is a test of understanding the effect of increasing one of the addends by 1. If you add 426 to 3748 and get 4174, adding 427 (which is 426 + 1) to 3748 would indeed increase the result by 1, making it 4175. So, Tom is correct.

Katie's statement: If \(3748 - 426 = 3322\), then \(3748 - 427\) must equal \(3321\), not \(3323\) as she claims.

The correct calculation for \(3748 - 427\) would be \(3321\), because subtracting 427 (which is 426 + 1) from 3748 would decrease the result by 1 compared to subtracting 426. So, Katie is incorrect when she says the result is \(3323\).

Given this analysis, the correct answer is that only Tom is correct.

Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of how changes in numbers affect the outcome. They might not fully grasp the logic presented by Tom and Katie.
  - A=40% (they might think Tom's logic is correct but not fully understand Katie's mistake)
  - B=20% (they might think Katie is correct without realizing her mistake)
  - C=20% (they might think both are correct without understanding the arithmetic)
  - D=20% (they might not understand either argument)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of arithmetic but might still make errors in applying logic to new situations.
  - A=60% (they likely understand Tom's correct logic)
  - B=10% (they might still be confused about Katie's statement)
  - C=20% (some might still think both are right)
  - D=10% (a few might see that both are incorrect)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the arithmetic and can apply logical reasoning.
  - A=80% (most will see Tom is correct)
  - B=5% (few will incorrectly think only Katie is correct)
  - C=5% (a few might still mistakenly think both are correct)
  - D=10% (some might realize both statements' validity)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their arithmetic and logical reasoning skills.
  - A=90% (they will clearly see Tom's correctness)
  - B=0% (they won't think Katie is correct without realizing the mistake)
  - C=5% (very few might mistakenly think both are correct, but this is unlikely)
  - D=5% (a small percentage might argue against both, though this is also unlikely)

Based on the analysis:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
