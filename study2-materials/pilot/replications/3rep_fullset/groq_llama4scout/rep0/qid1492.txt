To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and the nature of the probability given. The question states that the probability of an event occurring is \( 0 \). This implies that the event cannot happen. The task is to match this probability to the most accurate description from the given options.

The descriptions provided are:
- A: Certain (probability = 1)
- B: Unlikely (probability < 0.5, but not specified exactly)
- C: Even chance (probability = 0.5)
- D: Impossible (probability = 0)

Given that the probability of the event occurring is \( 0 \), the correct answer is straightforward: D) Impossible, because an event with a probability of \( 0 \) cannot occur.

Let's consider how students at different levels might respond:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with understanding basic probability concepts. However, the concept of a probability of 0 being "impossible" is quite intuitive and often grasped early on. Still, there might be some confusion with other concepts, but given the straightforward nature of this question, most should be able to identify that an event with a probability of 0 is impossible.
  - below_basic: A=0% B=5% C=5% D=90%

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a foundational understanding of probability. They should be able to distinguish between certain, likely, unlikely, and impossible events based on their probabilities. Given that 0 is the lowest possible probability, it should be clear that the event is impossible.
  - basic: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of probability concepts and can apply them accurately. For a probability of 0, they should confidently select "impossible" without confusion.
  - proficient: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand probability well but can also reason about more complex scenarios. For them, a probability of 0 being associated with an impossible event is basic knowledge, and they should select the correct answer without hesitation.
  - advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

In conclusion, given the straightforward nature of the question and the intuitive understanding that a probability of 0 means an event is impossible, even students at the lower ability levels are likely to get this right, with the majority at all levels except "below basic" choosing the correct answer without significant error. 

The specific predictions, however, reflect an understanding that even students who are less confident in their mathematical abilities can grasp the intuitive concept that a probability of 0 implies impossibility.

Thus, the response format requested yields:

below_basic: A=0% B=5% C=5% D=90%
basic: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
