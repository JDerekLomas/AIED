To approach this question, let's consider the properties of a parallelogram and how students at different ability levels might respond.

1. **Properties of a Parallelogram**: In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. This is a fundamental property that is often taught early on in geometry.

2. **The Question**: The question presents a parallelogram with one angle given as \(120^{\circ}\) and asks for the size of angle \(q\), which is opposite to the \(120^{\circ}\) angle.

3. **Expected Response**: Given the property that opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal, the correct answer is that angle \(q = 120^{\circ}\).

4. **Analyzing Potential Errors**:
   - **Misconception about Parallelograms**: Some students might not recall or might misunderstand the properties of parallelograms, potentially leading them to incorrectly apply properties of other shapes or to mistakenly think that adjacent angles are equal or that the sum of angles in a parallelogram is \(180^{\circ}\) (which applies to triangles or along a straight line).
   - **Distractors**: 
     - A: \(60^{\circ}\) might appeal to students who mistakenly think that angles in a parallelogram must add up to \(360^{\circ}\) and that the other angle adjacent to \(120^{\circ}\) must be \(60^{\circ}\), then incorrectly assume \(q\) would be \(60^{\circ}\) if they forgot opposite angles are equal.
     - B: \(80^{\circ}\) seems arbitrary and might attract students who have no clear understanding or make a random guess.
     - D: "Not enough information" could attract students who are unsure about the properties of a parallelogram or if they think more information about the other angles or sides is needed.

5. **Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level**:

   - **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric properties. They might not recall that opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal. Therefore, they might be more likely to choose an incorrect option or "Not enough information."
     - Below Basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%

   - **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make simple errors. They are likely to know about opposite angles but could be distracted by other properties.
     - Basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%

   - **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of geometry and should easily identify that angle \(q = 120^{\circ}\).
     - Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%

   - **Advanced**: Students at this level not only know the properties but can also apply them accurately in various contexts. They are unlikely to make errors on this question.
     - Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
