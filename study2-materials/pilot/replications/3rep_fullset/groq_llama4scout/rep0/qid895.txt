To approach this question, let's first analyze the calculation and the statements made by Jo and Paul.

The original calculation is \(9 - 8 + 5\).

## Step 1: Evaluate the original calculation
Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), we first perform the subtraction and then the addition:
\(9 - 8 + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6\).

## 2: Evaluate Jo's suggestion
Jo suggests \(9 - (8 + 5)\). Let's calculate it:
\(8 + 5 = 13\), then \(9 - 13 = -4\).
So, Jo's suggestion does not equal 6.

## 3: Evaluate Paul's suggestion
Paul suggests leaving it as \(9 - 8 + 5\), which we've already calculated to equal 6.

## 4: Determine who is correct
Since \(9 - 8 + 5 = 6\) and \(9 - (8 + 5) = -4\), Paul is correct that his way equals 6, and Jo is incorrect because her suggestion does not equal 6.

## 5: Analyze the misconception
The common misconception here involves misunderstanding the order of operations. However, the question is about who is correct in making the calculation equal to 6, not about solving it through incorrect operations.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the order of operations and not fully understand how to evaluate expressions. They might incorrectly think both or neither is correct due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make mistakes with order of operations or evaluating expressions. They might lean towards Paul because they see his calculation works.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations and can evaluate expressions correctly. They should see that Paul's method results in 6 and Jo's does not.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the operations but can also analyze and evaluate different approaches to solving problems. They should clearly see Paul's correctness and Jo's incorrectness.

## 7: Estimate percentages
Given the straightforward nature of evaluating \(9 - 8 + 5\) and \(9 - (8 + 5)\), and comparing them to 6:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (thinking Jo's method could work), B=40% (seeing Paul's correctness), C=10% (incorrectly thinking both), D=30% (thinking neither).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=70%, C=15%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
