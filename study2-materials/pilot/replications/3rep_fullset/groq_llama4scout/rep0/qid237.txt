To approach this question, let's first understand the algebraic concept involved and then consider how students at different ability levels might respond.

The expression given is \((p-3)(p+3)\). When expanded, this follows the difference of squares formula: \((a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2\). Applying this, we get:

\[
(p-3)(p+3) = p^2 - 3^2 = p^2 - 9
\]

So, comparing this to \(p^2 \color{purple}\triangle p \color{green}\bigcirc\), we see that \(\color{green}\bigcirc = -9\).

Now, let's consider how students at different ability levels might respond:

### below_basic
Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic expansion, especially with the difference of squares. They might incorrectly apply rules or make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- A: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = +6\): 20% (guessing or incorrect expansion)
- B: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = +0\): 15% (not understanding the subtraction in difference of squares)
- C: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = +9\): 30% (misapplying the formula or adding)
- D: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = -9\): 35% (correct understanding, but this might be high for "below_basic")

### basic
Students at this level have a foundational understanding of algebra but might still make careless mistakes or not fully grasp the implications of the difference of squares.
- A: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = +6\): 10% (less likely to make as many errors as below_basic)
- B: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = +0\): 10% 
- C: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = +9\): 20% 
- D: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = -9\): 60% (most should get it right, but some errors still)

### proficient
Students at this level have a solid understanding of algebraic concepts and are less likely to make simple errors.
- A: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = +6\): 5%
- B: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = +0\): 5%
- C: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = +9\): 10%
- D: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = -9\): 80%

### advanced
Students at this level not only understand the algebra but can also apply it quickly and accurately. Errors are less likely.
- A: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = +6\): 0%
- B: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = +0\): 0%
- C: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = +9\): 5%
- D: \(\color{green}\bigcirc = -9\): 95%

Given these considerations, here is the response in the requested format:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
