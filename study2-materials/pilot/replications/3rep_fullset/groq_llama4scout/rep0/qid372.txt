## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question involves reflecting a point P across a given dashed line, which is the line y=2, and determining the new coordinates of point P. The original coordinates of P are (2,2).

## 2: Identifying the Reflection Process
To reflect a point across the line y=2, we need to find the distance of the point's y-coordinate from the line y=2 and then move the same distance to the other side of y=2. Since point P is on the line y=2, its reflection will also be on the line y=2.

## 3: Determining the New Coordinates
Given that the line of reflection is y=2 and point P is at (2,2), the reflection of P across the line y=2 will still be (2,2) because it lies on the line of reflection.

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
Students might make errors if they misunderstand the concept of reflection across a line. A common misconception could involve incorrectly calculating the distance from the line or not recognizing that a point on the line of reflection does not change position.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- Students at the below_basic level might not fully understand reflections or might struggle with coordinate geometry, potentially leading them to choose options that suggest a misunderstanding of the reflection process or the coordinates.
- Students at the basic level should have a grasp of reflections but might still make simple errors, such as not recognizing that a point on the line of reflection doesn't move.
- Students at the proficient level should understand that reflecting a point across a line it lies on results in the same point.
- Students at the advanced level should not only understand the concept but also apply it correctly without hesitation.

## 6: Estimating Response Percentages
Given the simplicity of the question and the fact that point P is on the line of reflection:
- below_basic: A=80% (correct, as it's straightforward and less likely to overthink), B=10%, C=5%, D=5% (errors due to lack of understanding).
- basic: A=90% (most get it right), B=5%, C=3%, D=2% (minor errors).
- proficient: A=95% (very confident in their answer), B=3%, C=1%, D=1% (rare errors).
- advanced: A=98% (almost all get it right), B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5% (very rare errors).

## 7: Finalizing Predictions
Based on typical student performance and understanding of geometric transformations:
- below_basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- basic: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
- advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
