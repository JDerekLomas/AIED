To approach this question, let's analyze the patterns and the changes to understand how many squares would be in Pattern 100 after the modification.

## Step 1: Understand the Original Patterns
The original Pattern 1 consists of a central column of 3 squares with an extra square on either side, making a total of 3 (central) + 2 (sides) = 5 squares. Pattern 2 consists of two central columns of 3 squares with one extra square on either side, making a total of 2*3 (central) + 2 (sides) = 8 squares.

## 2: Generalize the Pattern
For Pattern \(n\), we need to figure out the formula for the number of squares. 
- Pattern 1 has 5 squares.
- Pattern 2 has 8 squares.

Let's assume the number of squares in Pattern \(n\) for the first type (like Pattern 1) is \(3n + 2\) and for the second type (like Pattern 2) is \(6n + 2\), based on observed sequences and assuming a linear relationship.

## 3: Verify Given Information
Given that there are 302 squares in Pattern 100, let's verify which pattern it fits:
- For the first pattern type: \(3*100 + 2 = 300 + 2 = 302\). This matches, so Pattern 100 of the first type indeed has 302 squares.

## 4: Analyze the Change
The change involves removing the second block from each column of three squares. 
- In the original Pattern 1, there are 3 squares in a column. Removing one block (of 1 square) leaves 2 squares in that column.
- So, for Pattern 1, instead of 3 squares in the central column, there would be 2 squares, changing the total to \(2 + 2 = 4\) squares.

## 5: Calculate for Pattern 100 After Change
If the original Pattern 100 has 302 squares and follows \(3n + 2\), after removing one square from the central column of three (for each of the \(n\) patterns, but since it's per pattern, we consider the structure), the adjustment would simply be subtracting 1 square for the change in each of the central columns. 
- The formula adjustment for one type (like Pattern 1): \(3n + 2 - n = 2n + 2\).
- For \(n = 100\): \(2*100 + 2 = 200 + 2 = 202\).

## 6: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with pattern recognition and changes. They might not understand the relationship or could mistakenly apply a wrong operation. A=20% (thinking the reduction is minimal), B=15% (guessing), C=15% (another guess), D=50% (completely off or following a wrong calculation).
- **Basic**: These students understand basic patterns but might struggle with applying changes. A=30%, B=20%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Proficient**: Students see the pattern and can apply changes logically. A=10%, B=20%, C=60% (correct calculation: if 302 and removing 1 per column of 3, which applies to 100 columns effectively once, they get 301), D=10%.
- **Advanced**: These students quickly see the change and calculate accurately. A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%.

The best answer is D.
