To solve this, let's first understand the question. The question presents a bar divided into 4 equal sections, with the leftmost section colored green and further divided into 3 equal parts. The task is to find which calculation represents the fraction of the whole bar that the width of one of these small green sections represents.

The whole bar is divided into 4 sections, so each section represents \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the bar. The leftmost section is green and divided into 3, so each small green section represents \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the bar.

## Step 1: Determine the fraction represented by one small green section
The fraction of the bar that one small green section represents is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{3} \) because it's \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( \frac{1}{4} \).

## 2: Evaluate option D
Option D is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{3} \), which matches our calculation for the fraction represented by one small green section.

## 3: Consider common misconceptions and errors
A common misconception might involve confusing multiplication and division or misunderstanding how fractions of fractions work. However, this question seems straightforward because it directly relates to visual fractions and their multiplication.

## 4: Assess the difficulty of each option
- Option A: \( \frac{3}{6} \times \frac{1}{3} \) simplifies to \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6} \), which does not match.
- Option B: \( \frac{1}{4} \div \frac{1}{3} \) is equivalent to \( \frac{1}{4} \times 3 = \frac{3}{4} \), which does not match.
- Option C: \( \frac{3}{6} \div 3 = \frac{1}{2} \div 3 = \frac{1}{6} \), which does not match.
- Option D: \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{12} \), which matches our understanding.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding fractions and operations. They might choose any option based on misunderstanding. However, the visual cue might help some to eliminate obviously incorrect options. Let's assume A=20%, B=20%, C=20%, D=40% (guessing).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic fractions. They might still be confused but are more likely to understand multiplication of fractions. Let's assume A=10%, B=15%, C=15%, D=60%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand fractions well and are less likely to make calculation errors. Let's assume A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident and accurate. Let's assume A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
