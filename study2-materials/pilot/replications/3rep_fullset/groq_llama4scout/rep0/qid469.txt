To solve this, let's first work out the calculation and then consider the potential misconceptions and how they might affect students at different ability levels.

The calculation given is \(1 \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3}\).

First, convert \(1 \frac{2}{3}\) into an improper fraction: \(1 \frac{2}{3} = \frac{(1 \times 3) + 2}{3} = \frac{3 + 2}{3} = \frac{5}{3}\).

Now, perform the subtraction: \(\frac{5}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5 - 1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\).

Convert \(\frac{4}{3}\) back into a mixed number: \(\frac{4}{3} = 1 \frac{1}{3}\).

So, the correct answer is \(1 \frac{1}{3}\), which corresponds to option A.

Let's analyze the potential misconceptions and student responses:

- **Misconception leading to B (\(\frac{2}{3}\))**: This could arise from incorrectly subtracting the fractions without considering the whole number part properly.
- **Misconception leading to C (\(\frac{1}{3}\))**: This might occur if a student incorrectly subtracts \(\frac{1}{3}\) from \(1\) (getting \(\frac{2}{3}\)) and then mistakenly thinks that's the result, or simply misunderstands the operation.
- **Misconception leading to D (\(1\))**: This would happen if a student simply subtracts \(\frac{1}{3}\) from \(1 \frac{2}{3}\) and incorrectly rounds or misunderstands the fraction part.

Considering these:

- **Below Basic**: Students here might struggle significantly with the concept of mixed numbers and fraction subtraction. They might not accurately convert \(1 \frac{2}{3}\) to \(\frac{5}{3}\), and their subtraction skills could be lacking. 
  - A: 20% (a few might stumble upon the right answer by chance)
  - B: 30% (incorrectly handling the fractions)
  - C: 20% (misunderstanding the subtraction)
  - D: 30% (not fully understanding fractions)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but may still struggle with mixed numbers and fraction operations. 
  - A: 50% (some understanding but might make calculation errors)
  - B: 25% (still prone to calculation mistakes)
  - C: 15% (simple miscalculation)
  - D: 10% (overly simplistic view)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and can apply them. 
  - A: 80% (mostly accurate but minor errors possible)
  - B: 10% (occasional miscalculation)
  - C: 5% (rare mistake)
  - D: 5% (clear misunderstanding)

- **Advanced**: Students here have a strong grasp of the concepts and rarely make errors. 
  - A: 95% (high accuracy)
  - B: 3% (unlikely but possible minor slip)
  - C: 1% (very rare error)
  - D: 1% (unlikely mistake)

Given the straightforward nature of this specific question and assuming most students understand basic fraction and mixed number operations:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
