To tackle this question, let's analyze the equation and the potential misconceptions or understanding that students at different levels might have.

The equation given is \(x^{2} - 9x = 0\). This can be factored as \(x(x - 9) = 0\), which gives solutions \(x = 0\) and \(x = 9\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Solutions
The solutions to the equation are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 9\). Therefore, Jo is correct that one solution is \(x = 0\), and Paul is incorrect that one solution is \(x = 3\).

## 2: Analyzing Potential Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with solving quadratic equations or factoring. They might not recognize that \(x = 0\) is a solution by inspection or might not understand how to factor the equation. However, the simplicity of the equation and the fact that \(x = 0\) can be easily checked as a solution might lead some to agree with Jo. The option that both are correct (C) or neither (D) might appeal to those who don't fully understand. Given the straightforward nature of \(x = 0\) being a solution, a significant portion might still choose A (Only Jo), but with a notable percentage possibly choosing C or D due to confusion.

## 3: Considering Misconceptions and Understanding
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a better grasp of solving simple quadratic equations. They should recognize \(x = 0\) as a solution. The mistake for Paul (\(x = 3\)) is obvious upon factoring or using the solutions directly. Thus, most should correctly identify Jo as correct and Paul as incorrect, leading to A (Only Jo) being a popular choice.

## 4: Evaluating Proficient and Advanced Students
- **Proficient:** These students are expected to solve quadratic equations confidently. They should easily factor the equation and identify both solutions, confirming Jo's statement and refuting Paul's. Hence, they should predominantly choose A (Only Jo), with minimal to no selection of B (Only Paul) or D (Neither is correct).

## 5: Advanced Students
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will not only solve the equation easily but also understand the implications of each step. They should have a deep understanding that \(x = 0\) and \(x = 9\) are solutions, making Jo correct and Paul incorrect. Therefore, they should also predominantly choose A (Only Jo).

## 6: Predicted Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=60% (recognizing \(x=0\)), B=10% (mistakenly supporting Paul), C=20% (think both are right), D=10% (think neither is right).
- **Basic:** A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=90%, B=2%, C=6%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** A=95%, B=1%, C=3%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=2% C=6% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%
