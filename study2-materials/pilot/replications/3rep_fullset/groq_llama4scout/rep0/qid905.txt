To approach this question, let's consider the characteristics of each type of angle and the likelihood of students at different ability levels selecting the correct or incorrect options.

- **Acute angles** are less than 90 degrees.
- **Obtuse angles** are greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.
- **Reflex angles** are greater than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees.
- A **right angle** is exactly 90 degrees.

Given the description and the visual cue of an angle larger than 90 degrees but smaller than 180 degrees, we're looking at an obtuse angle.

## Step 1: Analyzing the Options
- Option A (Acute) is incorrect because the angle described is larger than 90 degrees.
- Option B (Obtuse) seems correct based on the description.
- Option C (Reflex) is incorrect because the angle is less than 180 degrees.
- Option D (A right angle) is incorrect because it's exactly 90 degrees, and the angle in question is larger.

## 2: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic angle definitions. They might confuse acute with obtuse or not understand the ranges. There's a higher chance they would select A (Acute) because they might not fully grasp that an angle larger than 90 degrees isn't acute, or they might select D (A right angle) if they think the angle looks like it could be 90 degrees. 
  - Below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic concepts but might make simple mistakes. They are likely to understand that the angle is not acute or a right angle but might be tempted by C (Reflex) if they're unsure about the upper limit of obtuse angles.
  - Basic: A=20% B=60% C=15% D=5%

- **Proficient:** These students understand angle types well and are less likely to confuse them. They should easily identify the angle as obtuse.
  - Proficient: A=5% B=90% C=4% D=1%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and are unlikely to make mistakes on this question. They will almost certainly choose B (Obtuse).
  - Advanced: A=1% B=98% C=1% D=0%

## 3: Formatting the Response
Given the analysis:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=1% D=0%
