To approach this question, let's consider the concept being tested and the potential misconceptions. The task is to round \( \mathbf{1 2 6 . 0 5} \) to the nearest ten. 

## Step 1: Understanding Rounding Rules
Rounding to the nearest ten involves looking at the units digit. If the units digit is 5 or greater, the number is rounded up. If it's less than 5, the number is rounded down. However, when the units digit is exactly 5, the convention is to round to the nearest even number (or to the nearest multiple of 10 that makes the tens digit even), but a more straightforward approach often taught is to round up if the decimal part is .5 or greater.

## 2: Applying Rounding Rules to the Given Number
The number given is \( 126.05 \). To round to the nearest ten, we look at the last digit, which is 6 (ignoring the decimal part for a moment). Since 6 is greater than 5, we would normally round up. However, to be precise with the rules: \( 126.05 \) is closer to 130 than to 120 because 126 is exactly halfway between 120 and 130, and adding .05 pushes it slightly towards 130.

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be rounding solely based on the integer part without properly considering the decimal or misinterpreting the rounding rules. For example, some might mistakenly think \( 126.05 \) rounds to 126 because they ignore the decimal part or misunderstand the rule for .05.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic rounding concepts. They might round to 100 (A) because they misunderstand the place value or mistakenly think .05 is very small and doesn't affect the rounding much. Some might choose D (126) because they ignore the rounding instruction. B (120) and C (130) are less likely but still possible.
- **Basic:** Students here should have a good grasp of rounding to the nearest ten. However, some might still choose B (120) if they mistakenly round down or D (126) if they think .05 doesn't change the tens place. C (130) seems a likely correct answer, but some could mistakenly pick A (100) or B (120).
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to understand the rounding concept well and choose C (130) as the correct answer. Mistakes might include choosing B (120) if there's confusion about how .05 affects the rounding or D (126) for similar reasons.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have a strong understanding of mathematical concepts. They are likely to choose C (130) correctly. Errors might be minimal but could include B (120) or D (126) for those who overthink or misapply the rules.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the question and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (understanding of place value lacking), B=30% (rounding down), C=40% (correct), D=10% (ignoring decimal).
- **Basic:** A=5%, B=20%, C=60%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** A=2%, B=10%, C=80%, D=8%.
- **Advanced:** A=1%, B=5%, C=90%, D=4%.

The best answer is C. 

Below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
Basic: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
Proficient: A=2% B=10% C=80% D=8%
Advanced: A=1% B=5% C=90% D=4%
