## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to factorise the quadratic expression \(3x^{2} + 5x + 2\). This involves finding two numbers that multiply to \(3 \times 2 = 6\) and add to \(5\), and then using these to split the middle term and factorise.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Factorisation
To factorise \(3x^{2} + 5x + 2\), we look for factors of \(6\) that add up to \(5\). These are \(2\) and \(3\), because \(2 \times 3 = 6\) and \(2 + 3 = 5\). So, we can rewrite the expression as \(3x^{2} + 2x + 3x + 2\) and then factorise by grouping: \(x(3x + 2) + 1(3x + 2) = (3x + 2)(x + 1)\).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \((3x + 2)(3x + 1)\) does not match our factorisation.
- Option B: \((3x + 2)(x + 1)\) matches our factorisation.
- Option C: Cannot be factorised. This is incorrect because we have found a way to factorise it.
- Option D: \((3x + 1)(x + 2)\) does not match our factorisation.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with factorisation and could easily choose an incorrect option or think it cannot be factorised. They might not even attempt to factorise it correctly. Option C (Cannot be factorised) could be a common choice due to lack of understanding or confidence in factorisation. A=20%, B=10%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and might attempt factorisation. However, they could still make mistakes, especially if they are not confident in their ability to factorise. They might be tempted by options that look plausible but are incorrect. A=30%, B=40%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level are expected to have a solid understanding of factorisation techniques. They should be able to identify the correct factorisation with ease. A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand how to factorise but also do so efficiently. They are less likely to make mistakes on straightforward questions like this. A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 5: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the predicted percentages for each ability level are as follows:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
