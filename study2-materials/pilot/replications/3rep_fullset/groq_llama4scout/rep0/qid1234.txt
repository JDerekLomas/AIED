## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task involves predicting the percentage of students at different ability levels (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for a given question about rotating a shape $180^{\circ}$ through the origin and determining the new location of a red point.

## 2: Analyzing the Question
The question provides a quadrilateral $P$ with specific coordinates and asks for the location of the red point after rotating the shape $180^{\circ}$ through the origin. The red point is initially at $(-1, 3)$.

## 3: Rotation Process
A $180^{\circ}$ rotation through the origin transforms a point $(x, y)$ to $(-x, -y)$. Applying this to the red point $(-1, 3)$, we get the new coordinates as $(1, -3)$.

## 4: Identifying the New Location
The points given are: A $(3, 1)$, B $(1, -1)$, C $(3, -1)$, D $(1, -3)$. The new location of the red point $(1, -3)$ matches point D.

## 5: Assessing Difficulty and Misconceptions
This question tests understanding of geometric transformations, specifically rotation. A common misconception could be mistakenly applying the rotation or misinterpreting the coordinates. However, the transformation is straightforward, and if students understand the concept of a $180^{\circ}$ rotation about the origin, they should be able to apply it correctly.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below_Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with coordinate geometry and rotations. They might not apply the rotation formula correctly or might confuse the coordinates. Expect a higher chance of incorrect answers, potentially spread across A, B, and C, but with a significant portion possibly choosing A or B due to a lack of understanding of the transformation.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in applying the rotation formula or in reading coordinates. They are more likely to understand the concept of rotation but might make calculation errors.
- **Proficient**: These students should understand the rotation concept well and be able to apply it accurately. They are likely to get the correct answer, D, with minimal errors.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of geometric transformations and are expected to answer correctly with ease.

## 7: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below_Basic**: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic**: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
