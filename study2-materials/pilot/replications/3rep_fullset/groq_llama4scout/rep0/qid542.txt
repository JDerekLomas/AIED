To tackle this question, let's first understand the key terms involved and then assess how students at different ability levels might respond.

- **Variable**: A symbol that represents a value that can change.
- **Expression**: A group of numbers, symbols, and/or operators that represents a value. It can include variables, constants, and mathematical operations.
- **Equation**: A statement that two mathematical expressions have the same value, often with an equals sign (=) between them.
- **Term**: A single part of an expression, separated by plus signs (+) or minus signs (-).

The given expression is \(6 - 3g\). 

- It does not have an equals sign, so it's not an **equation** (C).
- It consists of more than one term (or part) separated by a minus sign, but in the context of algebraic expressions, we consider it as an expression made of terms. However, specifically, \(6\) and \(-3g\) are terms, making the whole thing an **expression** (B) and more specifically, it's composed of **terms** (D).
- A **variable** (A) is part of it (the \(g\)), but the question is about what describes the whole \(6 - 3g\).

## Predictions:

### below_basic:
At this level, students may struggle with basic algebraic vocabulary. The concept of an "expression" might be challenging, and they might confuse it with an "equation" because they see a mathematical statement. 
- A=20% (some might think "variable" describes it because of \(g\), but not commonly)
- B=40% (correct but might require some thought)
- C=30% (might think it's an equation due to lack of understanding)
- D=10% (term might not be considered as it refers to parts of the expression)

### basic:
Students at this level have a basic understanding but may still confuse these terms. They are more likely to understand "expression" but might still make mistakes.
- A=10%
- B=60% (more likely to understand it's an expression)
- C=20%
- D=10%

### proficient:
These students have a solid understanding of algebra vocabulary. They should easily identify \(6 - 3g\) as an expression.
- A=5%
- B=80% (most will know it's an expression)
- C=5%
- D=10%

### advanced:
At this level, students not only understand the terms but also the context and implications of each. They are highly likely to choose the correct term.
- A=0%
- B=90% (very confident in identifying it as an expression)
- C=0%
- D=10%

Thus, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
