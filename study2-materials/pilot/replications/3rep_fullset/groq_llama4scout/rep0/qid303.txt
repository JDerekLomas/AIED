To approach this question, let's first understand what the total surface area of a cuboid entails. The total surface area of a cuboid is the sum of the areas of all six faces. For a cuboid with dimensions length (\(l\)), width (\(w\)), and height (\(h\)), the formula for the total surface area (\(TSA\)) is:

\[ TSA = 2(lw + lh + wh) \]

Given the dimensions of the cuboid in the question are:
- Height (\(h\)) = 4 cm
- Depth (\(d\)) = 3 cm (which we can consider as the width, \(w\))
- Width (\(w\)) = 6 cm (which we can consider as the length, \(l\))

The total surface area can be calculated as:
\[ TSA = 2[(6 \times 3) + (6 \times 4) + (3 \times 4)] \]
\[ TSA = 2[(18) + (24) + (12)] \]
\[ TSA = 2[54] \]
\[ TSA = 108 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \]

However, the question does not ask for the calculation of the total surface area but rather which of the given calculations would give the total surface area.

Let's analyze the options:
A: \( (6 \times 4) + (6 \times 3) + (4 \times 3) \)
B: \( 6 \times 4 \times 3 \)
C: \( (6 \times 4) \times (6 \times 3) \times (4 \times 3) \)
D: \( [(6 \times 4) + (6 \times 3) + (4 \times 3)] \times 2 \)

## Step 1: Understanding Option A
Option A calculates the sum of the areas of three faces, which is part of what is needed but does not account for all six faces.

## 2: Understanding Option B
Option B calculates the volume of the cuboid, not the surface area.

## 3: Understanding Option C
Option C is the product of the areas of all three pairs of faces, which overcomplicates and incorrectly calculates the surface area.

## 4: Understanding Option D
Option D calculates the sum of the areas of the three pairs of faces and then multiplies by 2, which correctly accounts for all six faces of the cuboid.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with the basic formulas. They might confuse the calculation of volume and surface area. Option B seems like a plausible calculation for something, and they might not fully understand what each option represents. 
  - A: 20% (some understanding of area but not complete)
  - B: 40% (confusion with volume)
  - C: 20% (overcomplication)
  - D: 20% (some might stumble upon the correct method)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might not apply it correctly in all contexts. They are more likely to recognize B as incorrect for surface area but might still struggle.
  - A: 30% (partial understanding)
  - B: 30% (mistake)
  - C: 15% (unlikely but possible due to confusion)
  - D: 25% (starting to understand the correct approach)

- **Proficient:** These students should have a good grasp of the formulas. They are likely to eliminate B and C easily.
  - A: 20% (might see this as part of the solution but not complete)
  - B: 5% (recognize as volume)
  - C: 5% (recognize as incorrect)
  - D: 70% (understand the correct formula)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level will quickly identify the correct formula and eliminate incorrect options.
  - A: 5% (unlikely to choose this)
  - B: 0% (know it's volume)
  - C: 0% (know it's incorrect)
  - D: 95% (confident in the correct formula)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=30% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=20% B=5% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
