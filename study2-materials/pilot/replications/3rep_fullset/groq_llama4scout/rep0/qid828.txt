To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and the potential pitfalls for students at different levels.

The question requires students to calculate \(30\%\) of \(£120\). This is a straightforward percentage calculation that can be computed as \(0.30 \times 120 = 36\).

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic percentage calculations or converting percentages to decimals. They might incorrectly calculate \(30\%\) of \( £120 \) or choose an answer based on a misunderstanding of percentages. 
  - A: \( £30 \) might seem like a simple subtraction or an incorrect percentage calculation.
  - B: \( £36 \) is the correct answer, but let's see if students at this level would get it.
  - C: \( £90 \) could be a result of miscalculating \(30\%\) as \(75\%\) or another incorrect percentage.
  - D: \( £360 \) could result from thinking \(30\%\) is \(300\%\) or another significant miscalculation.

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple errors.
  - They are likely to understand \(30\% = 0.30\), but might struggle with the multiplication or choose an obviously incorrect answer.

- **Proficient:** These students are expected to handle percentage calculations confidently.
  - They should easily compute \(30\%\) of \( £120 \) as \( £36 \).

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to not only compute the answer but also understand the context and potentially more complex applications.

Given these considerations, here's a predicted breakdown:

- **Below Basic:** 
  - A: \(20\%\) (simple mistake, direct percentage as amount)
  - B: \(40\%\) (gets it right through luck or basic understanding)
  - C: \(20\%\) (misinterprets percentage)
  - D: \(20\%\) (significant miscalculation)

- **Basic:**
  - A: \(5\%\) (unlikely to make such a simple error if understanding percentages)
  - B: \(80\%\) (confident in basic calculation)
  - C: \(10\%\) (might confuse with \(25\%\) or another close percentage)
  - D: \(5\%\) (unlikely to make such a large error)

- **Proficient:**
  - A: \(0\%\) (understands basic percentages)
  - B: \(95\%\) (accurately calculates)
  - C: \(3\%\) (minor confusion)
  - D: \(2\%\) (unlikely significant error)

- **Advanced:**
  - A: \(0\%\)
  - B: \(98\%\) (very confident in calculation)
  - C: \(1\%\)
  - D: \(1\%\)

So, the percentages are as follows:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
