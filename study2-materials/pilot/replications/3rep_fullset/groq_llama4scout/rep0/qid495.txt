## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula for the area of a triangle.
The area of a triangle is given by the formula: \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). In this case, the base is \( \sqrt{64} \) and the height is \( 4 \) cm.

## 2: Calculate the base of the triangle.
The base of the triangle is \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \) cm, since \( 8^2 = 64 \).

## 3: Apply the formula for the area of a triangle.
Using the formula, \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 4 = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \) cm\(^2\).

## 4: Evaluate the answer choices.
The correct answer is \( 16 \) cm\(^2\), which corresponds to option D.

## 5: Consider common misconceptions and errors.
A common misconception might be to forget the \( \frac{1}{2} \) factor, leading to \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \) cm\(^2\) (option A). Another could be misinterpreting \( \sqrt{64} \) as \( 64 \) directly, leading to \( \frac{1}{2} \times 64 \times 4 = 128 \) cm\(^2\), but this isn't an option. Squaring the height or base incorrectly isn't directly relevant here.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students might not understand the formula or miscalculate \( \sqrt{64} \). They could choose A (not applying \( \frac{1}{2} \)), B (misinterpreting \( \sqrt{64} \) as 64), or C (exaggerated error).
- **Basic:** Students understand the basic formula but might make simple calculation errors. They are likely to choose A (due to forgetting \( \frac{1}{2} \)) or less likely B or C.
- **Proficient:** Students know the formula and can calculate accurately. They should mostly choose D, with a few possible errors leading to A.
- **Advanced:** Students not only know the formula but are also less prone to errors. They should almost all choose D.

## 7: Assign percentages based on predicted errors and understanding.
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (common error), B=20% (misinterpretation), C=20% (larger error), D=20% (correct but challenging).
- **Basic:** A=30% (forgetting \( \frac{1}{2} \)), B=10%, C=5%, D=55%.
- **Proficient:** A=10%, B=5%, C=2%, D=83%.
- **Advanced:** A=2%, B=1%, C=1%, D=96%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=5% D=55%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=2% D=83%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=1% D=96%
