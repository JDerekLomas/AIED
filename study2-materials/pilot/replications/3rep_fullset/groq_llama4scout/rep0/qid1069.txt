To approach this question, let's first understand what the function machine does and then evaluate the statements made by Tom and Katie.

The function machine takes an input \(x\), first multiplies it by 5 (giving \(5x\)), and then subtracts this result from 8 (giving \(8 - 5x\)).

## Step 1: Evaluate Tom's Statement
Tom says the output is \(5x - 8\). However, according to the function machine's operations, the correct output is \(8 - 5x\), not \(5x - 8\). So, Tom is incorrect.

## 2: Evaluate Katie's Statement
Katie says the output is \(8 - 5x\), which matches the operations described for the function machine: multiply \(x\) by 5 to get \(5x\), then subtract \(5x\) from 8, resulting in \(8 - 5x\). So, Katie is correct.

## 3: Determine the Correct Answer Choice
Given that Tom is incorrect and Katie is correct, the correct answer is B: Only Katie.

## 4: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic expressions and understanding function machines. They may not fully comprehend the operations or may reverse them easily. There's a high chance they could select A (Only Tom) or D (Neither is correct) due to misunderstanding the operations. 
  - A: 30% (misunderstanding of operations, thinking Tom is right)
  - B: 20% (correct understanding, but this group might struggle)
  - C: 10% (unlikely to understand both are correct when one is clearly incorrect)
  - D: 40% (completely misunderstanding, thinking neither is correct)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple errors. They are more likely to understand the sequence of operations but could get confused.
  - A: 20% 
  - B: 60% 
  - C: 5% 
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts and should easily follow the function machine's operations.
  - A: 5% 
  - B: 80% 
  - C: 5% 
  - D: 10%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts easily. They would quickly identify Katie's correctness and Tom's incorrectness.
  - A: 2% 
  - B: 90% 
  - C: 5% 
  - D: 3%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
