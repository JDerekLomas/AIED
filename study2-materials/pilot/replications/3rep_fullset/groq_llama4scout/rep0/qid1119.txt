To predict how students at different ability levels would respond to this question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions it might trigger.

The question requires converting \(5\) kilometres and \(7\) centimetres into metres. The correct conversion involves knowing that \(1\) kilometre \(= 1000\) metres and \(1\) centimetre \(= 0.01\) metres. Thus, \(5\) kilometres \(= 5 \times 1000 = 5000\) metres, and \(7\) centimetres \(= 7 \times 0.01 = 0.07\) metres. Adding these together gives \(5000 + 0.07 = 5000.07\) metres.

## Step 1: Identify the correct answer
The correct way to write \(5\) kilometres and \(7\) centimetres in metres is \(5000.07\) metres, which corresponds to option B.

## 2: Consider common misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect conversions, such as adding the centimetres directly to the kilometres without proper conversion (leading to option C: \(5007\) m) or misunderstanding the conversion factors.

## 3: Analyze option A (\(5070 \mathrm{~m}\))
This option might seem plausible to students who incorrectly convert \(7\) centimetres to metres as \(70\) metres (which is not correct since \(7\) cm \(= 0.07\) m), or those who mistakenly add \(5\) km and \(7\) cm in a wrong unit conversion.

## 4: Analyze option C (\(5007 \mathrm{~m}\))
This could be a tempting option for students who correctly convert \(5\) kilometres to \(5000\) metres but then mistakenly add \(7\) metres (incorrectly assuming \(7\) centimetres equals \(7\) metres) instead of \(0.07\) metres.

## 5: Analyze option D (\(5700 \mathrm{~m}\))
This option seems to result from a significant misunderstanding, possibly adding \(5\) km (\(5000\) m) to \(7\) cm (incorrectly converted or considered as \(700\) m), which doesn't align with common unit conversion errors in a straightforward manner.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with unit conversions and basic arithmetic. They might choose D (\(5700 \mathrm{~m}\)) because it involves a simple addition error, or A (\(5070 \mathrm{~m}\)) due to misinterpreting the centimetres. B (\(5000.07 \mathrm{~m}\)) seems unlikely for this group due to the decimal representation. So, below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with decimals or conversions. They might lean towards C (\(5007 \mathrm{~m}\)) due to a simpler error (not converting centimetres to metres correctly). So, basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand conversions well and are less likely to make basic errors. They should predominantly choose B (\(5000.07 \mathrm{~m}\)), with some potential for A or C due to careless mistakes. So, proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%.
- **Advanced:** This group is expected to have a strong grasp of conversions and decimals. They are likely to choose B (\(5000.07 \mathrm{~m}\)) with near certainty. So, advanced: A=0% B=95% C=5% D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=5% D=0%
