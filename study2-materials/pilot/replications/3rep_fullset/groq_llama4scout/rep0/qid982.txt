To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and how students at different levels might respond.

The question tests the understanding of ratios and fractions in a context. Specifically, it requires students to understand that if \( \frac{1}{7} \) of the film is left to watch, then \( \frac{6}{7} \) of the film has been watched. The ratio of how much they have watched to how much they have yet to see is therefore \( \frac{6}{7} : \frac{1}{7} \), which simplifies to \( 6:1 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception might involve confusing the fraction of the film left with the fraction watched or misinterpreting the ratio. However, the question is structured to make the correct calculation straightforward.

## 2: Analyzing Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding fractions and ratios. They might incorrectly calculate or compare the parts of the film watched and left to see. Given the simplicity of the fractions (1/7 and 6/7), some might still manage to get it right by chance or by recognizing the relationship between the fractions. However, errors are likely to be high.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a grasp of basic fractions and might understand that if 1/7 is left, 6/7 has been watched. They might still struggle to express this as a ratio correctly but are more likely to understand the fractional parts.
- **Proficient:** These students are expected to comfortably work with fractions and ratios. They should easily recognize that 6/7 of the film has been watched and 1/7 is left, leading to a ratio of 6:1.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand fractions and ratios but can also apply them in various contexts efficiently. They would likely have no trouble with this question.

## 3: Predicting Responses
Given the question's clarity and the straightforward nature of the math involved:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (misinterpreting the watched part as 1), B=10% (misinterpreting and reversing), C=60% (correctly identifying 6 parts watched to 1 part left), D=10% (misinterpreting the left part as 6).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=10%, C=70%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 4: Final Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **below_basic:** A=15% B=5% C=70% D=10%
- **basic:** A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- **proficient:** A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=96% D=4%

The best answer is C.
