To approach this question, let's first understand the concept being tested and the common misconceptions associated with it. The question involves sharing an amount of money (£30) in a given ratio (3:2) and representing this situation with diagrams. 

The correct representation should reflect that the total parts in the ratio are 3+2 = 5 parts, and these parts share the £30. This means each part represents £30 / 5 = £6. Therefore, Tom gets 3 parts (£18) and Katie gets 2 parts (£12).

## Step 1: Understanding the Ratio and Sharing
The ratio 3:2 means for every 3 parts Tom gets, Katie gets 2 parts. The total amount to be shared is £30.

## 2: Analyzing the Diagrams
- A: A bar split into 3 pink blocks and 2 blue blocks. All blocks are the same size, and each block is labelled £30. This implies each block represents £30, which is incorrect since the total is £30, not each part.
- B: A pink bar split into 3 blocks, and below it a shorter blue bar split into 2 blocks. All blocks are the same size, and the difference in length between the pink and blue bars is labelled £30. This suggests the difference in their shares is £30, not the total amount.
- C: A bar split into 3 pink blocks and 2 blue blocks. All blocks are the same size, and the length of the whole bar is labelled £30. This suggests the total length (representing the total money) is £30, and it is divided into 5 equal parts.
- D: A pink bar split into 3 blocks, and below it a shorter blue bar split into 2 blocks. All blocks are the same size, and the length of the pink bar is labelled £30. This implies Tom's share is £30, which is incorrect.

## 3: Identifying the Correct Diagram
The correct diagram should show that the entire bar (representing the total £30) is divided into 5 equal parts (3 parts for Tom and 2 parts for Katie), which matches diagram C.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding ratios and sharing. They might be confused by the labelling and the concept of equal parts. 
  - A: 40% (misunderstanding of equal parts and labelling)
  - B: 30% (confusion with differences and totals)
  - C: 20% (some might grasp the total but not the division)
  - D: 10% (simple misunderstanding)

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic ratios but might make errors in calculation or interpretation.
  - A: 25%
  - B: 20%
  - C: 45% (understand the concept but might calculate wrong)
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient:** These students understand ratios and can calculate shares but might be distracted by misleading diagrams.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 15%
  - C: 70%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are confident in their understanding and calculation of ratios.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 85%
  - D: 5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
