To approach this question, let's consider the algebraic manipulation involved and the common misconceptions students might have.

The expression given is \( \frac{x^{2}-1}{x+1} \). This can be simplified by recognizing that \( x^{2} - 1 \) is a difference of squares, which factors into \( (x+1)(x-1) \). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[ \frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x+1} \]

For \( x \neq -1 \), this simplifies further to \( x - 1 \), because the \( (x+1) \) terms cancel out.

## Step 1: Understanding the Simplification
The correct simplification of the given expression is \( x - 1 \), which corresponds to option C.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to cancel the \( (x+1) \) terms without properly considering the restriction that \( x \neq -1 \), but in this case, the question does not ask for the domain, just the simplified form. Another misconception could be not recognizing the difference of squares or not canceling the terms correctly.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( x + 1 \) is incorrect because it doesn't properly simplify the expression.
- Option B: \( x \) is incorrect for the same reason.
- Option C: \( x - 1 \) is the correct simplification.
- Option D: \( None \) of the options would be chosen if none of A, B, or C are correct.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with algebraic manipulations, including factoring and canceling terms. They might not recognize \( x^{2} - 1 \) as a difference of squares or might incorrectly simplify the expression. 
  - A: 20% (incorrect but plausible due to confusion)
  - B: 20% (similarly, incorrect and plausible)
  - C: 30% (correct, but might be guessed or partially understood)
  - D: 30% (not understanding any option)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes or not fully understand the implications of \( x \neq -1 \).
  - A: 10% (less likely to choose this incorrectly as they have some understanding)
  - B: 10% (similarly less likely)
  - C: 70% (most should get it right with basic understanding)
  - D: 10% (a few might not understand)

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebra and should easily simplify the expression.
  - A: 5% (unlikely to make such a basic mistake)
  - B: 5% (similarly unlikely)
  - C: 85% (most will get it right)
  - D: 5% (very few would choose this)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have a deep understanding and would likely find the question straightforward.
  - A: 0% (very unlikely to choose incorrectly)
  - B: 0% (very unlikely)
  - C: 95% (almost all will get it right)
  - D: 5% (a few might choose this out of an abundance of caution or if they see a trap)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
