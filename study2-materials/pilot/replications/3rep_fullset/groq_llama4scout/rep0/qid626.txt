## Step 1: Understand the question and the shape
The question describes a compound shape made up of a square and a regular pentagon, with the area of the square given as \( 144 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \). The first step is to find the side length of the square, which is \(\sqrt{144} = 12 \mathrm{~cm}\).

## 2: Determine the side length of the regular pentagon
Since the shape is made by joining the square and the regular pentagon along one edge, the side length of the regular pentagon is also \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \) because a regular pentagon has all sides of equal length.

## 3: Calculate the perimeter of the square and the pentagon
The perimeter of the square is \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \mathrm{~cm} \).
The perimeter of a regular pentagon with side length \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \) is \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 4: Calculate the perimeter of the compound shape
When the square and the pentagon are joined along one edge, that edge is counted twice in the total perimeter of both shapes but should only be counted once in the perimeter of the compound shape. Therefore, the perimeter of the compound shape is \( 48 + 60 - 2 \times 12 = 48 + 60 - 24 = 84 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 5: Analyze potential student errors
- A common misconception might be to simply add the perimeters of the square and the pentagon and then subtract the two shared sides, which is essentially what was done but let's see if students would stumble.
- Another error could be forgetting to subtract the shared side twice.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students might not understand how to calculate the perimeter of a compound shape or might not know how to find the side length of the square from its area. They might also struggle with the concept of a regular polygon. Expect high rates of incorrect responses, possibly towards D) \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \) if they only consider the side of the square, or random guesses.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to calculate the side length of the square and understand basic perimeter calculations. However, they might make calculation errors or forget to subtract the shared side. Expect some correct answers but also errors, possibly A) \( 108 \mathrm{~cm} \) if they add perimeters and subtract one side.
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately calculate the perimeter of both shapes and correctly account for the shared side. Expect a high percentage to choose B) \( 84 \mathrm{~cm} \).
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the calculations but are also less likely to make careless errors. They should all choose B) \( 84 \mathrm{~cm} \) with a very high confidence.

## 7: Assign percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
- **Basic**: A=30% B=50% C=10% D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=30% B=50% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
