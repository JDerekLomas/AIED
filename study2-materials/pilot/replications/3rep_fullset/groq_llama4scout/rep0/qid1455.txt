To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question requires translating a verbal description into an algebraic equation. The description is: "I think of a number. I add on five and then multiply the result by four. The answer I get is \( 17 \)".

## Step 1: Understand the Correct Equation
The correct translation of the given description into an equation is \( 4(n + 5) = 17 \), which corresponds to option D. This is because you first add 5 to the number (\( n + 5 \)), and then you multiply the result by 4.

## 2: Analyze Potential Misconceptions
- Option A (\( n + 5 \times 4 = 17 \)) suggests adding 5 to \( n \) and then multiplying 5 by 4, which does not follow the order of operations described.
- Option B (\( 4n + 5 = 17 \)) implies multiplying \( n \) by 4 and then adding 5, which also does not match the description.
- Option C (\( n^4 + 5 = 17 \)) implies raising \( n \) to the power of 4 and then adding 5, which is a completely different operation.

## 3: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and translating text into equations. They might be more likely to choose an option that seems simpler or more familiar, even if incorrect. Option B might appeal because it involves straightforward multiplication and addition, just not in the correct order.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding of algebra. They might still fall into the trap of misinterpreting the order of operations or misunderstanding how to translate the text. Option A could be tempting because it directly uses numbers given in the problem in a simplistic way.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebra and are more likely to accurately translate the verbal description into an equation. However, they might still consider common misconceptions. Option D should be appealing, but there's a chance some might misinterpret the description.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are not only proficient but also have a deeper understanding and can handle more complex algebraic manipulations. They should easily identify the correct equation.

## 4: Estimate Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple, direct operations), B=30% (straightforward but incorrect), C=20% (unlikely but potentially confused with powers), D=10% (understands the sequence).
- **Basic**: A=30%, B=25%, C=10%, D=35% (starting to understand sequences better).
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=5%, C=5%, D=80% (strong understanding of algebraic translation).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (clear understanding).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
