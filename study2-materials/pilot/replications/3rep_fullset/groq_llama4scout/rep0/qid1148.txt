## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula for distance between two points
The question provides two points, \( (2,-5) \) and \( (-7,1) \), and asks for the distance between them using the formula \( \sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}} \). The student labels the points as \( x_{1} = 2 \), \( y_{1} = -5 \), \( x_{2} = -7 \), and \( y_{2} = 1 \).

## 2: Apply the formula with the given points
Substitute the given values into the formula: \( \sqrt{(-7-2)^{2}+(1-(-5))^{2}} = \sqrt{(-9)^{2}+(6)^{2}} = \sqrt{81+36} = \sqrt{117} \).

## 3: Analyze the potential misconceptions and errors
A common misconception could be misapplying the formula or incorrectly calculating the differences \( x_{2}-x_{1} \) and \( y_{2}-y_{1} \). However, the question seems straightforward as it guides the student through labeling the points and applying the formula correctly.

## 4: Evaluate the answer choices
- A: \( \sqrt{6} \) seems too small given the calculations.
- B: \( \sqrt{30} \) is also too small.
- C: \( -\sqrt{45} \) is incorrect because distance cannot be negative.
- D: \( \sqrt{117} \) matches the calculation.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with applying the formula or calculating the squares and square root. They might incorrectly calculate or choose an answer that seems too simple, like A or B. Some might incorrectly select C due to not understanding that distance is positive. A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to follow the formula but might make calculation errors. They are less likely to choose C. A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately apply the formula and calculate the result. They are likely to choose D. A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will easily and accurately calculate the distance, choosing D. A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

## 6: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
