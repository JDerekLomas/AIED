To approach this question, let's consider what is being tested: the definition of a regular polygon. A regular polygon is a shape with at least three sides, where all sides are of equal length, and all internal angles are equal.

1. **Understanding Regular Polygons**: 
   - A regular polygon has two main properties: all sides must be equal in length, and all angles must be equal.
   - A rhombus has all sides of equal length but does not necessarily have all angles equal (only opposite angles are equal, and they can vary; in a regular rhombus, which is a square, all angles are right angles).
   - A rectangle has opposite sides of equal length and all angles are right angles (90 degrees), but not all sides are necessarily equal.

2. **Identifying the Shapes**:
   - A square is both a rhombus and a rectangle and is a regular polygon because it meets both criteria: all sides are equal and all angles are equal.
   - For a shape to be a regular polygon, it must have equal sides and equal angles.

3. **Assessing the Options**:
   - **Tom's Claim (Rhombus)**: Only a rhombus with all angles equal (which makes it a square) would be a regular polygon. A general rhombus is not.
   - **Katie's Claim (Rectangle)**: Only a rectangle with all sides equal (which again makes it a square) would be a regular polygon. A general rectangle is not.

Given these considerations, let's evaluate the likely student responses based on ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the definitions. They might mistakenly think any shape with "regular" sides or angles could be considered a regular polygon. 
  - A (Only Tom) = 20%, B (Only Katie) = 20%, C (Both Tom and Katie) = 30%, D (Neither is correct) = 30%

- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might apply it loosely.
  - A = 15%, B = 15%, C = 20%, D = 50%

- **Proficient**: Students understand the basic properties but need to apply them precisely. A rhombus and rectangle are special cases, and students might recall that only specific cases (like a square) are regular polygons.
  - A = 5%, B = 5%, C = 10%, D = 80%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to have a strong understanding of geometric definitions and can apply them accurately.
  - A = 0%, B = 0%, C = 0%, D = 100%

Therefore, considering typical student understanding and common misconceptions:

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=20% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
