To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question on the correct working out for $72 \times 36$, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls or ease of solution at each ability level: below_basic, basic, proficient, and advanced.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to identify the correct long multiplication working out for $72 \times 36$. The options provided include incorrect workings and/or incorrect final answers, testing both the process of long multiplication and the accuracy of calculations.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A shows incorrect working and an incorrect final answer. This would likely be recognizable as incorrect by most students, especially those at higher ability levels, but might still attract some students at lower ability levels due to not fully understanding the process.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B presents correct first-row working but incorrect second-row working and an incorrect final answer. Students need to spot the mistake in the second row to eliminate this option.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C demonstrates correct working but an incorrect final answer due to not adding the rows correctly (or implying a misunderstanding of place value). This could trap students who don't complete the calculation.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D shows correct working and a correct final answer. This is the only accurate solution.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below_Basic:** At this level, students struggle with basic multiplication and may not fully understand the long multiplication process. They might be attracted to options that seem simpler or less work-intensive. **A=30%** (due to confusion), **B=25%** (some understanding but easily misled), **C=20%** (recognize some correct steps but flawed), **D=25%** (some might get it right through guesswork or partial understanding).
  
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of multiplication but might still make errors in long multiplication. **A=20%** (recognize it's wrong but might not know why), **B=30%** (might not catch the second-row mistake), **C=25%** (see correct steps but error in addition or understanding), **D=25%** (understand and apply correctly).

- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand long multiplication but might get distracted by the presentation. **A=10%** (clearly wrong), **B=15%** (should spot the mistake), **C=20%** (correct process but might miscalculate final answer), **D=55%** (accurately complete and choose correct answer).

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to easily identify correct and incorrect workings. **A=5%** (obviously incorrect), **B=5%** (should easily identify mistake), **C=10%** (correct steps but not final answer), **D=80%** (no issues with correct identification).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=20% D=55%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
