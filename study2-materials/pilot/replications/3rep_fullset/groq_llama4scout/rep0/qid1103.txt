To solve this, let's first calculate what the first bracket in the formula \( \sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}} \) equals given the points \( (2,-5) \) and \( (-7,1) \).

## Step 1: Identify the coordinates
The coordinates given are \( (x_{1}, y_{1}) = (2, -5) \) and \( (x_{2}, y_{2}) = (-7, 1) \).

## 2: Apply the formula for the first bracket
The first bracket in the formula refers to \( \left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right) \). So, we substitute \( x_{2} = -7 \) and \( x_{1} = 2 \) into the equation to get \( (-7 - 2) = -9 \).

## 3: Square the result
The expression then becomes \( (-9)^{2} \) which equals \( 81 \).

## 4: Evaluate the answer choices
Given that \( \left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right) = -9 \), the correct calculation for the first bracket is \( (-9)^{2} \).

## 5: Assess student understanding
- The question specifically tests if students can correctly apply the distance formula and understand the order of operations within it.
- Students at the below_basic level might struggle with substituting the correct values into the formula and understanding what "the first bracket" refers to, potentially leading to confusion.
- Basic level students should be able to follow the formula but might make careless mistakes in calculation or substitution.
- Proficient students should easily identify \( x_{2} - x_{1} \) as \( -7 - 2 = -9 \) and then understand \( (-9)^{2} \) is the correct step.
- Advanced students will not only calculate it correctly but also quickly recognize the correct answer choice.

## 6: Estimate student responses
- **Below_basic**: Might confuse the calculation or the formula. Expect a significant portion to choose incorrectly, possibly B or D due to miscalculation or misunderstanding of the formula. A=40% (guessing), B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Should have a better grasp but still might make simple arithmetic mistakes. Expect a higher percentage to choose A but still some to err. A=60%, B=15%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: Should easily calculate \( -9 \) and then \( (-9)^{2} \). A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Will almost universally choose correctly without hesitation. A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.

The best answer is A. 

Given the detailed thought process, here is the prediction in the exact required format:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
