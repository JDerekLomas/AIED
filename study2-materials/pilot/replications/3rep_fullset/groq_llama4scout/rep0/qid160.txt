## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula provided
The area \(A\) of a trapezium is given by the formula \(A = \frac{1}{2}(a + b)h\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the parallel sides and \(h\) is the perpendicular height. For the given trapezium, \(a = x + 2\), \(b = x + 4\), and \(h = x\). The area is given as \(40 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\). So, we have \(40 = \frac{1}{2}(x + 2 + x + 4)x\).

## 2: Derive the equation from the given information
Substitute the given values into the area formula: \(40 = \frac{1}{2}(2x + 6)x\). Simplify to get \(40 = \frac{1}{2}(2x^2 + 6x)\), which further simplifies to \(40 = x^2 + 3x\). Rearrange to get \(x^2 + 3x - 40 = 0\). This is a quadratic equation.

## 3: Solve the quadratic equation
To solve \(x^2 + 3x - 40 = 0\), we can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 3\), and \(c = -40\). Substituting these values in gives \(x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(-40)}}{2(1)}\).

## 4: Calculate the solutions using the quadratic formula
Calculate inside the square root: \(x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 160}}{2}\), which simplifies to \(x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{169}}{2}\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{-3 \pm 13}{2}\). This gives two solutions: \(x = \frac{-3 + 13}{2} = 5\) and \(x = \frac{-3 - 13}{2} = -8\).

## 5: Compare the solutions to the given options
The solutions to the equation are \(x = 5\) and \(x = -8\). Comparing these to the provided options:
- A: \(x = -8\) and \(x = -5\)
- B: \(x = -8\) and \(x = 5\)
- C: \(x = 8\) and \(x = -5\)
- D: \(x = 8\) and \(x = 5\)

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with solving the quadratic equation or even deriving it from the given problem. They might not correctly solve \(x^2 + 3x - 40 = 0\) or might choose an option that seems plausible but incorrect. Given the direct solutions, option B seems like it could be chosen by those who get the correct solutions but let's assume errors lead to a spread across incorrect options. A=20%, B=40%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp but might still make calculation errors. They are more likely to correctly identify that the equation solves to \(x = -8\) and \(x = 5\), thus B is the correct answer. A=10%, B=60%, C=15%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to solve the equation accurately and choose the correct option. A=5%, B=80%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to solve the problem without error and quickly identify the correct solutions. A=0%, B=90%, C=0%, D=10%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
