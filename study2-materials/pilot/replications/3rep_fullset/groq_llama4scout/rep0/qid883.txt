## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question tests students' understanding of solving linear equations, specifically the ability to apply inverse operations correctly. The equation given is \(\frac{5x}{3} - 1 = -2.4\). The task is to evaluate two proposed next steps in solving the equation: Tom's \(5x - 3 = -7.2\) and Katie's \(\frac{5x}{3} = -3.4\).

## 2: Evaluate Tom's proposed step.
To check Tom's step, we apply the operation he implicitly used to get from the original equation to his proposed step. If we multiply every term in the original equation by 3, we get \(5x - 3 = -7.2\), which matches Tom's step. This operation is valid.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's proposed step.
For Katie's step, \(\frac{5x}{3} = -3.4\), we add 1 to both sides of the original equation: \(\frac{5x}{3} - 1 + 1 = -2.4 + 1\), which simplifies to \(\frac{5x}{3} = -1.4\). Katie's step does not match this correct operation; she wrote \(-3.4\) instead of \(-1.4\). Thus, Katie's proposed step is incorrect.

## 4: Determine the correct answer based on the evaluations.
Given that Tom's step is correct and Katie's step is incorrect, the correct answer is that only Tom is correct.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not accurately apply inverse operations or check the validity of steps. Given the simplicity of checking Tom's step (multiplying by 3) and the straightforwardness of Katie's error, we might expect a significant portion to incorrectly validate Katie's step or fail to recognize Tom's as correct. A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make errors in applying operations. They are more likely to recognize Tom's correct step but might still be tricked by Katie's. A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic manipulations and should easily identify Tom's correct step and Katie's error. A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the algebraic manipulations but also can quickly assess the validity of proposed steps. They are likely to find both Tom's and Katie's steps easily evaluable. A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%

## 6: Format the predictions according to the required format.
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
