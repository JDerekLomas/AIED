## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The question provides a table of values for the equation \(y = x^2 - x + 3\) and asks to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = -1\), which is represented by \(\bigstar\).

## 2: Calculate the value of \(y\) for \(x = -1\)
To find \(y\) when \(x = -1\), we substitute \(x = -1\) into the equation \(y = x^2 - x + 3\).
So, \(y = (-1)^2 - (-1) + 3 = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5\).

## 3: Analyze the potential for student errors
The question is designed to test if students can correctly substitute a value into a given equation. The equation \(y = x^2 - x + 3\) is straightforward, and the calculation for \(x = -1\) does not seem to trigger common algebraic mistakes since it involves simple arithmetic operations.

## 4: Consider student ability levels and potential errors
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with substituting \(x = -1\) into the equation or with the arithmetic. They might incorrectly calculate \(y\) as \(-3\) (A) due to confusion with negative numbers or simply not performing the calculation correctly.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to substitute \(x = -1\) into the equation but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to get \(y = 5\) (B) but could potentially choose \(y = 3\) (C) if they incorrectly think the \(+3\) cancels out or is ignored in some simple manner.
- **Proficient:** These students should have no issue with substituting \(x = -1\) into the equation and calculating \(y = 5\). They are less likely to make errors.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to easily and accurately substitute \(x = -1\) into the equation, yielding \(y = 5\). They are highly unlikely to make mistakes.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (common mistake with negatives), B=60% (correct answer, but might not reach this level), C=10% (simple error), D=10% (unlikely but possible confusion).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** A=2%, B=95%, C=2%, D=1%.

## 6: Adjust predictions based on realistic student performance
Realistically, most students, even those who are proficient or advanced, have a small chance of making a careless error. The correct calculation yields \(y = 5\), so:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=50% C=10% D=10%
- **Basic:** A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced:** A=2% B=92% C=3% D=3%

The best answer is B.
