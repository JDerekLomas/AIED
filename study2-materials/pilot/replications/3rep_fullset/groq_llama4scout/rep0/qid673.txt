To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential for student misconceptions.

The question involves reflecting a point across the line \(y = x\). The point \(P\) is given as \((3,2)\), and the line of reflection is the dashed line representing \(y = x\). When reflecting a point \((x, y)\) across the line \(y = x\), the new coordinates become \((y, x)\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Reflection Across \(y = x\)
The point \(P(3,2)\) reflected across \(y = x\) becomes \(P'(2,3)\).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \((2,2)\)
- Option B: \((1,2)\)
- Option C: \((2,3)\)
- Option D: \((3,4)\)

## 3: Identifying the Correct Answer
The correct reflection of point \(P(3,2)\) across the line \(y = x\) is \((2,3)\), which corresponds to Option C.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding coordinates and reflections. They might not apply the correct rule for reflection across \(y = x\) or might get confused with the coordinates. A significant portion might choose an option that seems like a simple transformation or no transformation at all. Let's predict:
  - A: 20% (guessing or misunderstanding the concept)
  - B: 15% (another guess or incorrect application)
  - C: 40% (correct application, surprisingly high for this level)
  - D: 25% (misunderstanding or incorrect calculation)

- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a basic understanding of coordinates and might know the rule for reflecting across \(y = x\). However, they might make careless mistakes.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 70% (should understand the concept but might be slightly lower due to careless errors)
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to understand and correctly apply the reflection rule.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 2%
  - C: 90% (strong understanding and application)
  - D: 3%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also apply it accurately and quickly.
  - A: 2%
  - B: 1%
  - C: 95% (very confident in their answer)
  - D: 2%

## 5: Conclusion
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
- basic: A=10% B=5% C=70% D=15%
- proficient: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
- advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=70% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%
