To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or understanding related to subtracting fractions.

The question revolves around the concept of finding a common denominator to subtract fractions. The fractions given are \( \frac{5}{6} \) and \( \frac{1}{3} \). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept
To subtract these fractions, a common denominator is needed. The denominators are 6 and 3. The least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 3 is 6, because 6 is divisible by both 6 and 3.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Suggestion
Tom suggests changing both denominators to 6. This is a valid approach since 6 is a common multiple of both 6 and 3. \( \frac{1}{3} \) can be converted to \( \frac{2}{6} \) by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 2. Then, \( \frac{5}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Suggestion
Katie suggests changing both denominators to 18. This is also a valid approach because 18 is a common multiple of both 6 and 3. \( \frac{5}{6} \) can be converted to \( \frac{15}{18} \) by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 3, and \( \frac{1}{3} \) can be converted to \( \frac{6}{18} \) by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 6. Then, \( \frac{15}{18} - \frac{6}{18} = \frac{9}{18} = \frac{1}{2} \).

## 4: Evaluating the Options
- Tom is correct because 6 is a common denominator.
- Katie is correct because 18 is also a common denominator.
Therefore, both Tom and Katie are correct in their suggestions for finding a common denominator to subtract the fractions.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of common denominators or might not fully understand the question. They might choose D (Neither is correct) out of confusion or choose one over the other incorrectly. Let's assume A=20% (thinking only Tom's method is straightforward), B=10% (similar reasoning), C=40% (understanding both are valid), D=30% (confusion).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of fractions but might be more prone to suggesting one method as exclusively correct. Let's assume A=10%, B=10%, C=70%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand fractions well and are less likely to doubt the validity of both methods. Let's assume A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concept but can also reason about the efficiency and validity of different methods. They would easily see both methods as correct. Let's assume A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
