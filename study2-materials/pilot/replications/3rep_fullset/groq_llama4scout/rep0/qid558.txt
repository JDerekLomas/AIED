To approach this question, let's first analyze the algebraic expression given: \( \frac{t^{2}+t-2}{t-1} \). The numerator can be factored into \( (t+2)(t-1) \), which then allows the expression to be simplified as \( \frac{(t+2)(t-1)}{t-1} \). For \( t \neq 1 \), this simplifies to \( t + 2 \).

## Step 1: Identify the Misconception
The common misconception here involves not properly canceling out the \( (t-1) \) terms or not recognizing that \( t = 1 \) would make the denominator zero, and thus the expression undefined at \( t = 1 \), but for all other \( t \), it simplifies to \( t + 2 \).

## 2: Analyze the Options
- A: \( t + 2 \) is the correct simplification.
- B: \( t - 1 \) would be incorrect as it doesn't properly simplify the given expression.
- C: \( t - 2 \) is also incorrect and seems to arise from mistakenly subtracting 2 from \( t \) without proper algebraic manipulation.
- D: "Does not simplify" is incorrect because the expression can indeed be simplified for \( t \neq 1 \).

## 3: Consider Student Errors by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with factoring the numerator and could easily pick incorrect options due to lack of understanding. However, the factorization \( t^{2}+t-2 \) into \( (t+2)(t-1) \) might not be immediately apparent. We might expect a high percentage to choose D, assuming they recognize the fraction but don't simplify. A=10%, B=20%, C=15%, D=55%.
- **Basic:** Basic level students might be able to attempt the factorization but could still make errors. They might correctly factor the numerator to get \( (t+2)(t-1) \) but then not cancel \( (t-1) \) properly. Expect a significant number to get it right but also errors: A=40%, B=30%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students should easily factor \( t^{2}+t-2 \) and cancel \( (t-1) \), leading to A. Errors would likely be minimal: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the algebra but also consider domain restrictions. They would quickly simplify to \( t + 2 \) and understand \( t \neq 1 \): A=98%, B=1%, C=1%, D=0%.

## 4: Provide Predictions
Given these considerations, here are the detailed predictions:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
