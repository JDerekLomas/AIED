To approach this question, let's first analyze the equation given: \(x^{2} - 10x - 25 = 0\). This is a quadratic equation in the form of \(ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -10\), and \(c = -25\).

## Step 1: Solve the Quadratic Equation
To understand which region the equation belongs to, we first need to solve it. The equation can be solved by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}\). Substituting \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the formula gives us \(x = \frac{-(-10) \pm \sqrt{(-10)^{2} - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-25)}}{2 \cdot 1}\).

## 2: Calculate the Solutions
Calculating inside the square root: \(x = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 + 100}}{2}\), which simplifies to \(x = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{200}}{2}\). Further simplification gives \(x = \frac{10 \pm 10\sqrt{2}}{2}\) or \(x = 5 \pm 5\sqrt{2}\). This means the equation has two distinct real solutions.

## 3: Determine if the Equation Factorises
The equation \(x^{2} - 10x - 25 = 0\) can be examined to see if it factorises easily. It looks like it could be a perfect square or factorable in a simple way, but given its form, let's try to factor it or complete the square. The equation does not factor easily into integers, suggesting it might not be straightforwardly in the 'Factorises' category without further manipulation.

## 4: Analyze the Solutions for 'Has one solution equal to 0'
Neither of the solutions \(x = 5 + 5\sqrt{2}\) or \(x = 5 - 5\sqrt{2}\) equals 0, so the equation does not have one solution equal to 0.

## 5: Conclusion on Regions
Given that the equation has two real solutions and neither equals 0, it does not belong in the 'Has one solution equal to 0' circle. The equation can be considered to factorise if we find its roots, but it doesn't neatly factor into simple factors with integer coefficients. However, it does have real roots, and upon inspection, \(x^{2} - 10x - 25 = (x - 5)^{2} - 50 = 0\), which can guide us to see it as \((x-5-5\sqrt{2})(x-5+5\sqrt{2}) = 0\), implying it does factor but not in a simple integer-coefficient way.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with solving quadratic equations and understanding what "factorises" means. They might incorrectly assume it has one solution or doesn't factor at all, leading to \(D = 60\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 10\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic quadratic equations but might not deeply understand the concept of factorisation or the conditions for real roots. They might see it doesn't have a solution of 0, and struggle with factorisation, so \(D = 40\%\), \(A = 30\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(B = 10\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand quadratic equations and can solve them. They might recognise the equation can be solved and has two distinct roots, not equal to 0. They should see it factorises in a non-standard way, so \(A = 50\%\), \(D = 30\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 5\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are familiar with quadratic equations, their solutions, and factorisation. They should easily solve the equation, see it doesn't have a root of 0, and understand it factorises, even if not into simple integers. So, \(B = 60\%\), \(A = 30\%\), \(D = 5\%\), \(C = 5\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
proficient: A=50% B=15% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
