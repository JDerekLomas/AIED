## Step 1: Understand the question and the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for a given question about time calculation.

## 2: Analyze the question
The question involves calculating the arrival time of a coach in London, given that it takes 3 hours 50 minutes to complete a journey from Manchester and it leaves Manchester at 09:25.

## 3: Identify potential misconceptions or traps
A common misconception could involve incorrectly converting times or adding hours and minutes improperly. However, the question seems straightforward: add 3 hours and 50 minutes to 09:25.

## 4: Calculate the correct answer
To find the arrival time: 09:25 + 3 hours = 12:25, then add 50 minutes. 12:25 + 50 minutes = 13:15.

## 5: Evaluate option attractiveness based on common errors
- Option A (13:25) might be chosen by those who incorrectly calculate the time or misinterpret the addition of hours and minutes.
- Option B (12:75) is incorrect because 75 minutes is not a valid time representation; it seems to confuse minutes with a combination of hours and minutes.
- Option C (01:15) suggests an error where the student perhaps adds the time to the next day or misinterprets the clock.
- Option D (13:15) is the correct answer.

## 6: Consider student ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic time calculations and conversions. They are more likely to make errors.
- **Basic**: These students have a foundational understanding but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- **Proficient**: Students here have a good grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make careless errors.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to understand the concept well and calculate accurately.

## 7: Predict student responses
- **Below_basic**: Might have difficulty with adding 3 hours 50 minutes to 09:25. Could mistakenly choose A (13:25) due to miscalculation (20%), B (12:75) due to confusion with time formats (10%), C (01:15) due to misunderstanding of time addition (5%), and D (13:15) if they manage to calculate correctly (65%).
- **Basic**: Less likely to choose B (5%) or C (5%), more likely to choose A (15%) due to simple arithmetic errors, and D (75%) if calculations are correct.
- **Proficient**: Unlikely to choose B (0%) or C (0%), might choose A (5%) due to oversight, and most will choose D (95%).
- **Advanced**: Virtually no chance of choosing B or C, minimal chance of A (0%), and almost certainly D (100%).

## 8: Adjust predictions to fit the required format
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
- **basic**: A=15% B=5% C=5% D=75%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
basic: A=15% B=5% C=5% D=75%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
