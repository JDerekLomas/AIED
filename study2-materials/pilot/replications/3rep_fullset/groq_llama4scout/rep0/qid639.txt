To approach this question, let's analyze the potential difficulties and the nature of the calculation involved.

The question requires solving for \(\square\) in the equation \(263 + \square = 900\). This involves subtracting 263 from 900 to find the value of \(\square\).

## Step-step Calculation
1. \(900 - 263 = 637\)

So, the correct answer is \(637\), which corresponds to option C.

## Analysis by Ability Level

### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations, including subtraction. Given the numbers involved (900 and 263), some might find the subtraction challenging or make calculation errors.
- A: \(1163\) seems like an addition of the two numbers, which could appeal to some as a straightforward but incorrect operation. (20%)
- B: \(747\) could be a result of incorrect subtraction or estimation. (15%)
- C: \(637\) is the correct answer. (40%)
- D: \(647\) is close to the correct answer but incorrect, possibly due to a calculation mistake. (25%)

### basic
Students at this level are expected to handle simple arithmetic operations with more accuracy but might still make some errors due to lack of attention or minor calculation mistakes.
- A: \(1163\) (5%)
- B: \(747\) (5%)
- C: \(637\) (80%)
- D: \(647\) (10%)
