To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it might pose.

The question involves finding the ratio of \( PQ:PR \) given the movements from \( P \) to \( Q \) and then from \( Q \) to \( R \). The movements are:
- From \( P \) to \( Q \): 4 squares right and 1 square up.
- From \( Q \) to \( R \): 8 squares right and 2 squares up.

## Step 1: Calculate the total movement from P to Q and from P to R.
To find \( PQ \) and \( PR \), we calculate the distance traveled in each case. However, since the movements are given in a grid and involve both horizontal and vertical components, we can directly compute the differences in \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates.

## 2: Determine the coordinates of P, Q, and R.
Assuming \( P \) is at \( (0, 0) \), then:
- \( Q \) is at \( (4, 1) \) because we move 4 squares right and 1 square up from \( P \).
- \( R \) is at \( (4 + 8, 1 + 2) = (12, 3) \) because we move 8 squares right and 2 squares up from \( Q \).

## 3: Calculate PQ and PR using distance formula.
The distance \( d \) between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by \( d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \).
- \( PQ = \sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 1} = \sqrt{17} \)
- \( PR = \sqrt{(12 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{144 + 9} = \sqrt{153} \)

## 4: Calculate the ratio of PQ:PR.
The ratio \( PQ:PR = \sqrt{17} : \sqrt{153} \).
To simplify, notice that \( 153 = 9 \times 17 \), so \( \sqrt{153} = \sqrt{9 \times 17} = 3\sqrt{17} \).
Thus, \( PQ:PR = \sqrt{17} : 3\sqrt{17} = 1 : 3 \).

## 5: Analyze potential misconceptions and student responses.
Given the calculation, the correct answer is \( D: 1:3 \).
- A common misconception might involve incorrectly calculating distances or ratios, especially if students are not careful with the coordinates or apply incorrect formulas.
- Another potential error could be in simplifying the ratio or misunderstanding the relationship between \( PQ \) and \( PR \).

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding coordinates, calculating distances, or finding ratios. They might choose \( A: 1:12 \) or \( B: 1:4 \) due to miscalculations or not fully understanding the question. \( A = 40\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 10\% \).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in calculations or in interpreting the movements. They are more likely to get it wrong than right but might have a chance at \( C \) or \( D \) if they have some grasp of ratios. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 25\% \), \( C = 30\% \), \( D = 25\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to accurately calculate distances and ratios. They might still make minor errors but are more likely to choose \( D \) correctly. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 15\% \), \( D = 70\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should have a strong understanding of coordinate geometry and ratios, making them very likely to choose \( D \) correctly. \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 0\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 95\% \).

The best answer is D. 

Below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
Basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
Proficient: A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%
Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
