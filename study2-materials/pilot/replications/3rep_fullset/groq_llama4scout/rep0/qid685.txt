To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about common factors of 6 and 9, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks for a common factor of 6 and 9. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The factors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. Therefore, the common factors are 1 and 3.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question seems straightforward, asking for a common factor of 6 and 9. The correct answer is A) \( 3 \), as 3 is a factor of both 6 and 9.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing factors with multiples or not fully understanding what a common factor is. Students might mistakenly choose a number that is a multiple of both numbers rather than a factor.

## 3: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \( 3 \) is indeed a common factor.
- Option B: \( 6 \) is a factor of 6 but not of 9.
- Option C: \( 9 \) is a factor of 9 but not of 6.
- Option D: \( 18 \) is a multiple of both 6 and 9 but not a factor.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand factors or might confuse factors with multiples. They could choose B, C, or D due to misunderstanding. Option A might seem correct to some, but errors could occur. Prediction: A=40% (some understand basic factor concept), B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a better grasp of basic mathematical concepts, including factors. They are more likely to choose A but might still make mistakes. Prediction: A=70%, B=15%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid understanding of factors and are less likely to make simple errors. Prediction: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand factors but are also less prone to careless mistakes. Prediction: A=95%, B=2%, C=1%, D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
