## Step 1: Understand the question
The question presents a table with the number of pets and their frequencies, and asks to find the value that would replace the star when calculating the mean number of pets owned.

## 2: Identify the relevant information
To calculate the mean, we need the total number of pets and the total number of students. The mean is given by the formula: mean = (total number of pets) / (total number of students).

## 3: Determine the total number of students
The total number of students can be found by summing up the frequencies: 9 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 23.

## 4: Understand what the star represents
The star represents the frequency of students who own 2 pets.

## 5: Analyze the options with common misconceptions
- Option A: $2+4=6$ suggests adding the number of pets to the frequency.
- Option B: $2-4=(-2)$ suggests subtracting the frequency from the number of pets, which doesn't make sense in this context.
- Option C: $2 \times 4=8$ suggests multiplying the number of pets by the frequency.
- Option D: $2 \div 4=0.5$ suggests dividing the number of pets by the frequency.

## 6: Consider the context of calculating the mean
To calculate the mean number of pets, we need to know the total number of pets. This is calculated by multiplying each number of pets by its frequency and then summing these products. The star (frequency for 2 pets) directly contributes to this calculation as $2 \times \bigstar$.

## 7: Evaluate the difficulty and potential misconceptions
The question directly tests understanding of what a frequency represents and how it's used in calculating a mean. A common misconception might involve incorrectly applying operations to the numbers given (e.g., adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing them inappropriately).

## 8: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of what the question asks. They might choose options that seem to involve simple operations without understanding the context: A=40% (simple addition), B=20% (might seem like a subtraction problem), C=30% (multiplication seems relevant but applied incorrectly), D=10% (division seems least likely but could be considered).
- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of arithmetic but might still confuse the operations: A=30%, B=15%, C=40% (as it directly involves the numbers given), D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of frequency and its role in calculating means. They are less likely to fall into common misconceptions: A=10%, B=5%, C=80% (as it correctly involves multiplying the number of pets by its frequency), D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong understanding and are unlikely to make errors: A=5%, B=0%, C=95%, D=0%.

## 9: Adjust predictions based on the specific calculation needed
The correct calculation for the mean involves using the frequency (star) in a multiplication to contribute to the total number of pets. Thus, the correct answer is related to the frequency of 2 pets, which is simply the value of the star itself, not an operation on 2 and 4.

## 10: Finalize predictions
Given the context, the star directly represents the frequency, which should be a positive integer. Let's assume a typical distribution considering common sense and statistical understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
- **Basic**: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

The best answer is C.
