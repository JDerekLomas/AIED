To tackle this question, let's first analyze the equations given and what they represent graphically:

1) \(3x + 2y = 12\)
2) \(y = 3 - x\)

## Step 1: Solve the equations to find the point of intersection.
To find where these two lines intersect, we can substitute the expression for \(y\) from the second equation into the first equation:

\(3x + 2(3 - x) = 12\)

Simplifying:

\(3x + 6 - 2x = 12\)

\(x + 6 = 12\)

\(x = 6\)

Then substitute \(x = 6\) into \(y = 3 - x\):

\(y = 3 - 6 = -3\)

So, the lines intersect at \((6, -3)\).

## 2: Determine the slopes of the lines to understand their orientation.
- The slope of \(3x + 2y = 12\) can be found by rearranging the equation into slope-intercept form \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the slope:

\(2y = -3x + 12\)

\(y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 6\)

So, the slope of the first line is \(-\frac{3}{2}\).

- The slope of \(y = 3 - x\) is \(-1\).

## 3: Analyze the answer choices.
- A: The blue line has a positive slope, and the red line also has a positive slope. This does not match our findings.
- B: The blue line has a positive slope, and the red line has a negative slope. This could potentially match if the slopes and intercepts align with our calculations.
- C: Both lines have negative slopes but are identical, which does not match since the lines should intersect and have different slopes.
- D: Both lines have negative slopes but seem to have the same slope and intercept, which does not match.

## 4: Detailed check of promising options.
Let's focus on B, as it shows lines with different slopes:

- Blue line through \((-3, 0)\) and \((0, 3)\) suggests a positive slope, which was initially misjudged. Let's calculate: \(m = \frac{3 - 0}{0 - (-3)} = 1\), which is indeed positive, not matching our \(-3/2\) slope for the first line.
- Red line through \((0, 6)\) and \((4, 0)\) suggests a slope of \(\frac{0 - 6}{4 - 0} = -\frac{3}{2}\), matching one of our lines.

However, re-evaluating the approach for accuracy in prediction:

## 5: Accurate Prediction.
Given that most students struggle with accurately plotting and identifying lines based on equations, let's correct the course and directly assess likely student responses based on common misconceptions and understanding:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to even plot the lines correctly or understand the concept of intersection. They might randomly select or choose based on visually appealing graphs. 
  - A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%

- **Basic**: Students here might have a basic understanding but could struggle with accurately graphing or solving the equations simultaneously. They might be misled by visual cues.
  - A=20% B=50% C=15% D=15%

- **Proficient**: These students should be able to solve the equations and understand the graphical representation. They are less likely to be misled.
  - A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to not only solve the problem accurately but also quickly identify the correct graphical representation.
  - A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
