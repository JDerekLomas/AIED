To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the misconceptions it might trigger.

The question revolves around the concept of parallel lines in the context of linear equations in slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the slope of the line. For two lines to be parallel, they must have the same slope but different y-intercepts.

## Step 1: Understanding the Conditions for Parallel Lines
For lines to be parallel, their slopes (\(m\)) must be equal, but their y-intercepts (\(b\)) must be different.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom claims \(y = 4 - 3x\) and \(y = 4 - 2x\) are parallel. 
- The first line can be rewritten as \(y = -3x + 4\), so its slope (\(m_1\)) is \(-3\).
- The second line can be rewritten as \(y = -2x + 4\), so its slope (\(m_2\)) is \(-2\).
Since \(m_1 \neq m_2\), Tom's lines are not parallel.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie claims \(y = 4 - 3x\) and \(y = 2 - 3x\) are parallel.
- The first line is \(y = -3x + 4\), with a slope (\(m_1\)) of \(-3\).
- The second line can be rewritten as \(y = -3x + 2\), with a slope (\(m_2\)) of \(-3\).
Since \(m_1 = m_2\) but the lines have different y-intercepts, Katie's lines are parallel.

## 4: Evaluating the Difficulty and Misconceptions
The question tests the understanding of parallel lines having the same slope but different intercepts. A common misconception might be to confuse the slope and intercept or to not fully apply the conditions for lines to be parallel. However, this question is relatively straightforward because it directly presents the equations in a comparable form.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the concept of slope and intercepts. They might not correctly identify the slopes or might confuse the conditions for parallel lines. 
  - A: Only Tom (likely incorrect because Tom's lines aren't parallel) = 20%
  - B: Only Katie (correct that Katie's lines are parallel) = 30%
  - C: Both Tom and Katie (incorrect because Tom's lines aren't parallel) = 10%
  - D: Neither is correct (incorrect because Katie's lines are parallel) = 40%

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes or not fully grasp the implications of the slope-intercept form.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 40%
  - C: 10%
  - D: 40%

- **Proficient:** Students at this level should reliably understand the concept and apply it correctly.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 60%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 30%

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the concept but can also analyze and apply it with precision.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 80%
  - C: 0%
  - D: 20%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=0% B=80% C=0% D=20%
