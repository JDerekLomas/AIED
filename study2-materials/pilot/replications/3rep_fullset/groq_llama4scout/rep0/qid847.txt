To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question asks to factorize the expression \(p^{2}+4p\). The correct factorization is \(p(p+4)\), which corresponds to option B.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
- A common misconception might be to try and factor this into a difference of squares or a perfect square trinomial, which does not apply here.
- Another misconception could be to overlook the possibility of factoring out a common factor.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \((p-2)(p+2)\), suggests a difference of squares, which equals \(p^{2} - 4\), not \(p^{2} + 4p\). This would be an incorrect application of a formula.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \(p(p+4)\), is the correct factorization. It requires the ability to identify and factor out a common factor, \(p\), from both terms.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \((p+2)(p+2)\), or \((p+2)^{2}\), equals \(p^{2} + 4p + 4\), not \(p^{2} + 4p\). This suggests a confusion with perfect square trinomials.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, "Does not factorise," would be incorrect because \(p^{2} + 4p\) can indeed be factorized by taking \(p\) common.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might be tempted by options that look like standard forms (A and C) without understanding how to apply them correctly. Option A might appeal due to its symmetry, and option C due to its form resembling a square. Option B seems unlikely as it requires a clear understanding of factoring. **A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%**
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a grasp of basic algebra but might still make errors in applying formulas or factoring. They are more likely to recognize the need for factoring but might choose A or C due to superficial resemblance to known formulas. **A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%**
- **Proficient:** Students here have a solid understanding of algebraic techniques, including factoring. They should easily identify \(p(p+4)\) as the correct factorization. **A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%**
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand but can also apply advanced techniques. They are highly likely to choose the correct option without hesitation. **A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%**

Given the above analysis:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
