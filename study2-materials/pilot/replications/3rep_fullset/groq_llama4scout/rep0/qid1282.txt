## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to factorize the quadratic expression \( x^{2}+9 x+14 \) and identify the second bracket when one factor is given as \( (x+2) \).

## 2: Factorizing the Quadratic Expression
To factorize \( x^{2}+9 x+14 \), we look for two numbers that add up to 9 and multiply to 14. These numbers are 7 and 2 because \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) and \( 7 + 2 = 9 \). Therefore, \( x^{2}+9 x+14 \) can be factorized as \( (x+7)(x+2) \).

## 3: Identifying the Correct Option
Given that the expression factorizes to \( (x+7)(x+2) \), the correct completion of the bracket beside \( (x+2) \) is \( (x+7) \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebra and factorization. They might not know how to factorize the quadratic expression or could make calculation errors. The correct answer, \( (x+7) \), might not be obvious, and they could be tempted by incorrect options. However, without a clear understanding of factorization, they might guess or choose an option that seems plausible. Given the simplicity of the question and the clear factor pairs, even students below basic might have a chance to get it right if they've seen similar questions. A=20% B=15% C=20% D=45%
- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a basic understanding of algebra and factorization. They might still make errors but are more likely to get the correct answer. The factorization \( (x+7)(x+2) \) is straightforward, so most should identify \( (x+7) \) as the correct second bracket. A=10% B=10% C=15% D=65%
- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts, including factorization. They should easily recognize that \( (x+7) \) and \( (x+2) \) are the factors. Errors should be minimal. A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have an excellent understanding of algebra and can apply it to complex problems. They will certainly get this question correct, as it's a basic factorization. A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the factorization and the clear options provided, the predictions lean towards a higher success rate for all but the below-basic level.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=20% D=45%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=15% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
