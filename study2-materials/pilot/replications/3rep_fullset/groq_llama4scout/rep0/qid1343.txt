To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 12 \div 2+1 \times 2= \), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to the order of operations.

The correct calculation, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), is:
\[ 12 \div 2 + 1 \times 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
The question tests the understanding of the order of operations. A common misconception is to perform operations in the order they appear or to get confused between multiplication/division and addition/subtraction.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( 9 \). This would be the result if one incorrectly performed the operations as \( (12 \div 2 + 1) \times 2 \) or simply added/subtracted/multiplied/divided in the wrong order, such as \( 12 \div (2+1) \times 2 \) which is not applicable here but shows a line of incorrect reasoning.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( 3 \). This seems an implausible result from a straightforward calculation error related to the given operations, suggesting a significant misunderstanding.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( 14 \). This result could come from incorrect calculation such as \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \) and \( 1 \times 2 = 8 \), then \( 6 + 8 = 14 \), which actually is the correct calculation, indicating that Option C might actually be a correct answer, not an incorrect one.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \( 8 \), which, as calculated, is the correct answer.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might perform the operations as they appear: \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \), then \( 6 + 1 = 7 \), and \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) (leading to C), or simply get confused and pick an answer at random. Given the simplicity of the numbers, random guessing or basic incorrect operations might lead to A=20%, B=10%, C=40%, D=30%.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic grasp of operations but might still make errors due to misunderstanding the order of operations. They are more likely to get it right but could be tempted by incorrect operations: A=15%, B=5%, C=20%, D=60%.
- **Proficient:** Students here understand the order of operations well. They'd likely calculate it correctly: A=5%, B=0%, C=5% (possibly due to miscalculation), D=90%.
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the order of operations but are also less likely to make careless mistakes. They'd almost certainly get it right: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=5% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=5% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
