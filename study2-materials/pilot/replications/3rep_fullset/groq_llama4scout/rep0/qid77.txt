## Step 1: Understand the concept of perpendicular lines in mathematics
To determine which line is perpendicular to \(y = 3x - 2\), we need to recall that for two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1. The slope of the given line \(y = 3x - 2\) is 3.

## 2: Identify the slopes of the given options
- Option A: \(y = \frac{1}{3}x + 1\), slope = \(\frac{1}{3}\)
- Option B: \(y = 5 - \frac{1}{3}x\), slope = \(-\frac{1}{3}\)
- Option C: \(y = 3x + 7\), slope = \(3\)
- Option D: \(x = 3y - 4\), rearranging gives \(y = \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{4}{3}\), slope = \(\frac{1}{3}\)

## 3: Apply the concept of perpendicular lines to the options
For a line to be perpendicular to \(y = 3x - 2\), its slope must satisfy \(3 \times m = -1\), where \(m\) is the slope of the other line. Solving for \(m\) gives \(m = -\frac{1}{3}\).

## 4: Analyze each option against the condition for perpendicular lines
- Option A has a slope of \(\frac{1}{3}\), so \(3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1\), not -1.
- Option B has a slope of \(-\frac{1}{3}\), so \(3 \times -\frac{1}{3} = -1\), which matches the condition.
- Option C has a slope of \(3\), so \(3 \times 3 = 9\), not -1.
- Option D has a slope of \(\frac{1}{3}\), so \(3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1\), not -1.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with the concept of slope and perpendicular lines. They might not correctly identify the slope of the given line or apply the formula correctly. Option B is the correct answer, but due to potential confusion, some might choose A or D because they see a \(\frac{1}{3}\) which could mistakenly seem related, or C because it has the same slope as the original line. Expect a spread but with a significant portion possibly choosing incorrectly due to misunderstanding.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make careless mistakes. They should know the slope of the given line and the condition for perpendicular lines. However, they might confuse the slopes or miscalculate. Option B should be recognizable as correct, but some might mistakenly choose A or D.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and can apply them. They will likely identify Option B as the correct answer because they know the slope needed for a perpendicular line. Mistakes might be minimal.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them quickly and accurately. They will easily identify Option B as correct and might not even consider the other options due to their obvious incorrectness.

## 6: Estimate the percentages for each ability level
Given the straightforward nature of the question once the concept is understood, and considering common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20% (struggling to apply the concept correctly)
- **Basic**: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10% (mostly get it right but some confusion)
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2% (high accuracy with some minor errors)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0% (accurate application with no errors)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
