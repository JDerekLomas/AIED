To approach this question, let's first analyze the sequence and the given nth-term rule to understand what the question is asking and what might trip up students at different levels.

The sequence given is: \(6, 14, 28, 48, 74, \ldots\)

Let's examine the differences between terms:
- \(14 - 6 = 8\)
- \(28 - 14 = 14\)
- \(48 - 28 = 20\)
- \(74 - 48 = 26\)

The differences between terms are increasing by \(6\) each time (\(14 - 8 = 6\), \(20 - 14 = 6\), \(26 - 20 = 6\)), which suggests that the sequence could be related to a quadratic expression since the second differences are constant.

The nth-term rule provided is: \(3n^2 + \triangle n + \square\)

## Step 1: Understanding the Sequence and Rule
To find \(\triangle\), let's assume \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\) and see if we can derive a formula that fits.

## 2: Deriving the Formula for the Sequence
For \(n = 1\), the term is \(6\), so \(3(1)^2 + \triangle(1) + \square = 6\) or \(3 + \triangle + \square = 6\).

For \(n = 2\), the term is \(14\), so \(3(2)^2 + \triangle(2) + \square = 14\) or \(12 + 2\triangle + \square = 14\).

## 3: Solving for \(\triangle\) and \(\square\)
From the equation for \(n = 1\): \(\triangle + \square = 3\).

From the equation for \(n = 2\): \(2\triangle + \square = 2\).

## 4: Finding \(\triangle\)
Subtracting the second equation from the first gives: \(-\triangle = 1\), so \(\triangle = -1\).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand sequences well or might not be able to derive or apply the nth-term formula correctly. They might guess or apply simple arithmetic operations. Given the complexity of deriving \(\triangle\), a significant portion might choose incorrectly, potentially favoring simple operations like addition or subtraction without calculation. 
  - A: \(+1\) might seem plausible for some as a simple positive operation.
  - B: \(-1\) could be a correct answer for some through incorrect derivation or guessing.
  - C: \(+3\) seems less likely without specific calculation.
  - D: \(-3\) also less likely.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might struggle with algebraic manipulations or sequence analysis. They might recognize the need for a quadratic but struggle with exact coefficients.
  - A: \(+1\) or B: \(-1\) might be considered based on simpler patterns or mistakes in calculations.

- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to correctly analyze the sequence and derive or apply the formula accurately. They should recognize the quadratic nature and potentially solve for \(\triangle\) and \(\square\).
  - B: \(-1\) seems the most likely correct answer based on calculations.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level should easily recognize the sequence's pattern, derive the nth-term rule, and accurately fill in \(\triangle\).
  - B: \(-1\) is expected as the correct answer.

Given these considerations and the typical errors students make:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
