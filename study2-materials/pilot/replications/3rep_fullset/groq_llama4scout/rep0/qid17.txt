To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the options provided.

The question asks for part of the proof that the sum of two odd numbers is even. An odd number can be represented as \(2n + 1\) or \(2n - 1\), where \(n\) is an integer.

## Option A Analysis
Option A: \( \begin{array}{l}2 n+(2 m+1) \\ =2(n+m)+1\end{array} \)
This option incorrectly adds an even number (\(2n\)) and an odd number (\(2m + 1\)) and concludes with an expression that represents an odd number, not a proof that the sum of two odd numbers is even.

## Option B Analysis
Option B: \( \begin{array}{l}(2 n-1)(2 m+1) \\ =4 m n+2 n-2 m-1 \\ =2(2 m n-n-m)+1\end{array} \)
This option multiplies two odd numbers and shows the result is odd, which does not address the question of the sum of two odd numbers being even.

## Option C Analysis
Option C: \( \begin{array}{l}\text { Odd + Odd } \\ =\text { even }\end{array} \)
This option simply states the fact without providing a proof or algebraic representation.

## Option D Analysis
Option D: \( \begin{array}{l}(2 n-1)+(2 m+1) \\ =2 n+2 m \\ =2(n+m)\end{array} \)
This option correctly represents the sum of two odd numbers (\(2n - 1\) and \(2m + 1\)) and simplifies to \(2(n + m)\), which is an even number because it is a multiple of 2.

## Predicted Student Responses

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and understanding of odd/even properties. They might be tempted by simple or familiar-looking expressions.
  - A: 30% (some might see it as adding two numbers but not fully understand the algebraic manipulation)
  - B: 20% (might seem complex but not necessarily wrong in their view)
  - C: 30% (a straightforward statement they might believe)
  - D: 20% (correct but requires understanding of algebra and odd/even sums)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basics but may still struggle with algebraic proofs.
  - A: 20% (less likely to choose as they might see it's not directly proving the sum of two odds is even)
  - B: 15% (understand it's not directly relevant but might appreciate the algebra)
  - C: 25% (still a simple statement but might look for more)
  - D: 40% (start to see the algebraic proof)

- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand algebraic representations and can apply them to prove simple properties.
  - A: 10% (clearly does not prove the statement)
  - B: 5% (not relevant to the sum of two odd numbers)
  - C: 10% (too simplistic for a proof)
  - D: 75% (clearly shows the sum of two odd numbers is even)

- **Advanced**: These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and can quickly identify correct proofs.
  - A: 5% (obviously incorrect)
  - B: 0% (not relevant)
  - C: 0% (not a proof)
  - D: 95% (clear and correct proof)

Given the analysis:

basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=10% D=75%
