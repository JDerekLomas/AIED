To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given equation \(-3=p+12\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might encounter.

## Step 1: Understanding the Equation
The equation given is \(-3=p+12\). To solve for \(p\), one needs to isolate \(p\) on one side of the equation. This involves subtracting 12 from both sides, yielding \(p = -3 - 12 = -15\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception or mistake in solving linear equations like this one is not applying the operations correctly to both sides of the equation or making a mistake with the signs. For example, students might add 12 to both sides instead of subtracting, or they might incorrectly handle the negative signs.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(p = 9\). This would result from adding 12 to -3 and then presumably adding or incorrectly handling the numbers.
- Option B: \(p = -15\). This is the correct solution.
- Option C: \(p = -9\). This might result from a student thinking \(-3 - 12 = -9\), possibly due to a miscalculation or incorrect handling of negative numbers.
- Option D: \(p = 15\). This seems to be a result of incorrectly adding or multiplying the numbers without considering the negative signs properly.

## 4: Ability Level Predictions
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They are more likely to make errors in handling signs and operations.
  - A: 20% (simple addition mistake)
  - B: 40% (correct, but might be guessed)
  - C: 30% (plausible mistake)
  - D: 10% (seems unlikely but could happen due to random guess or severe misunderstanding)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still make careless mistakes.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 70% (most should get it right)
  - C: 15%
  - D: 5%

- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebraic equations and less likely to make simple mistakes.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 85%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Advanced students have a deep understanding and can handle complex manipulations with ease.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 95%
  - C: 0%
  - D: 5% (unlikely but possible if overthinking)

## 5: Adjusting for Realistic Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors, the predictions should reflect common algebraic mistakes and the understanding that even proficient students can occasionally make careless errors.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
