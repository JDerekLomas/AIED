To approach this question, let's first understand what's being tested. The question involves a function machine that takes an input of \(n\), divides it by 5, and then adds 3. The correct mathematical representation of this process is \(\frac{n}{5} + 3\).

Jo says the output is \(\frac{n}{5} + 3\), and Paul says the output is \(\frac{n+3}{5}\). We need to evaluate who is correct based on the operations described.

## Step 1: Understand the Function Machine's Operations
The function machine's operations are: input \(n\), divide by 5, then add 3. So, the correct formula based on these operations is \(\frac{n}{5} + 3\).

## 2: Evaluate Jo's Statement
Jo states the output is \(\frac{n}{5} + 3\), which matches the correct sequence of operations: divide \(n\) by 5 and then add 3.

## 3: Evaluate Paul's Statement
Paul states the output is \(\frac{n+3}{5}\). This implies adding 3 to \(n\) before dividing by 5, which does not match the sequence of operations given.

## 4: Compare and Conclusion
Given the operations (divide by 5, then add 3), Jo is correct. Paul's formula would be correct if the operations were: add 3 to \(n\), then divide by 5.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand the operations or apply them correctly. They might see the formulas and guess or misunderstand the operations. Given the simplicity of the question but the potential for misunderstanding the order of operations, we might expect a significant percentage to choose incorrectly.
  - A (Only Jo) = 40% (some understand Jo is right but not the others)
  - B (Only Paul) = 20% (some think Paul's way is correct)
  - C (Both Jo and Paul) = 10% (some might think both are right for wrong reasons)
  - D (Neither is correct) = 30% (others might not understand either)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make mistakes due to misunderstanding the question or the operations.
  - A = 60% (most understand Jo's correctness)
  - B = 15% (some mistakenly think Paul is right)
  - C = 5% (few think both are correct)
  - D = 20% (some do not understand)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the mathematical operations and their order.
  - A = 80% (clearly understand Jo is correct)
  - B = 5% (a few might mistakenly support Paul)
  - C = 5% (very few think both are correct)
  - D = 10% (a small percentage might not see either as correct)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the operations but can also analyze and apply them accurately.
  - A = 90% (almost all see Jo as correct)
  - B = 2% (very few mistakenly support Paul)
  - C = 2% (almost no one thinks both are correct)
  - D = 6% (a small percentage might have a different perspective)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=2% D=6%
