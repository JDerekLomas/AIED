## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question requires students to use a graph of the quadratic function \(y = x^2 + 2x - 3\) to approximate the solution to the inequality \(x^2 + 2x - 3 < -3\). This can be rewritten as \(x^2 + 2x < 0\).

## 2: Analyzing the inequality
To solve \(x^2 + 2x < 0\), we factor out \(x\), getting \(x(x + 2) < 0\). This inequality holds true for \(-2 < x < 0\), because when \(x\) is between \(-2\) and \(0\), the factors \(x\) and \(x + 2\) have opposite signs, making the product negative.

## 3: Considering the graph
The graph of \(y = x^2 + 2x - 3\) is a parabola that opens upwards. The inequality \(x^2 + 2x - 3 < -3\) simplifies to \(x^2 + 2x < 0\), which, as found, has a solution of \(-2 < x < 0\). This corresponds to the section of the graph where \(y < -3\), which can be visually identified.

## 4: Evaluating the difficulty and potential misconceptions
The question might seem challenging due to its graphical nature and the requirement to translate an algebraic inequality into a graphical solution. However, the key here is recognizing that the inequality \(x^2 + 2x - 3 < -3\) essentially asks for where the graph of \(y = x^2 + 2x - 3\) is below \(y = -3\). This is a straightforward task if one understands the graph and the inequality.

## 5: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand the inequality and the graph. They might not correctly interpret the graph or solve the inequality, potentially leading to random or incorrect choices. Given the nature of the question, \(A = 40\%\) (as it directly corresponds to the correct solution of the inequality), \(B = 20\%\) (incorrect but suggests some understanding of intervals), \(C = 10\%\) (specific but wrong), \(D = 30\%\) (another incorrect interval).

- **Basic**: Students here might have a better grasp of solving inequalities and understanding graphs but could still make mistakes in interpreting the graph or solving the inequality. They might be more likely to choose \(A = 60\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 15\%\).

- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve the inequality and understand the graph. They are likely to choose \(A = 80\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 0\%\), \(D = 10\%\).

- **Advanced**: Advanced students will not only solve the inequality correctly but also quickly interpret the graph. They are very likely to choose \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 0\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

## 6: Finalizing predictions
Based on the above analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
- **basic**: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=10% C=0% D=10%
- **advanced**: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=0% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
