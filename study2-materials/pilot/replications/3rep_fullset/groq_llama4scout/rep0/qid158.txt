To approach this question, let's analyze what it tests and the potential difficulties students might face.

The question tests the understanding of the first step in finding the range of a data set. The range is defined as the difference between the highest and lowest values in the data set. A common misconception might involve confusion with other statistical measures, such as the mean (which involves adding all numbers together) or simply misunderstanding the definition of range.

The correct answer, D) Write the numbers in ascending or descending order, reflects the proper initial step to ensure identification of the smallest and largest numbers, which then allows for the subtraction to find the range. Option A directly gives away a part of the range calculation but isn't the first step. Option B is partially correct but doesn't acknowledge descending order as also viable. Option C is the method for finding the mean, clearly incorrect for finding the range.

Given the phrasing of the question, let's consider how students at various levels might respond:

- **Below Basic:** These students might not have a strong grasp of statistical concepts. They might be inclined to select an option that directly involves a calculation (A or C) because these seem like "doing something" with the numbers.
  - A=40% (seems like a direct calculation), B=20% (partial understanding but limited), C=25% (confusion with mean), D=15%.

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a foundational understanding but might still be prone to confusion.
  - A=30% (still tempting because it's part of the solution), B=35% (ascending order makes sense), C=20% (less confused with mean now), D=15%.

- **Proficient:** Students here have a solid understanding of basic statistics concepts.
  - A=10% (less likely to confuse), B=40% (knows ascending order), C=5% (rarely confused with mean), D=45% (understands flexibility).

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand but can also apply concepts accurately and think critically.
  - A=5% (rare mistake), B=35% (still knows this), C=0% (no confusion), D=60% (fully understands and can articulate).

Adjusting for realistic interpretations:
- **Below Basic:** A=45%, B=20%, C=25%, D=10%
- **Basic:** A=35%, B=40%, C=15%, D=10%
- **Proficient:** A=15%, B=45%, C=5%, D=35%
- **Advanced:** A=5%, B=30%, C=0%, D=65%

The final prediction, rounded to the nearest 5%, could look like:
below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=45% C=5% D=35%
advanced: A=5% B=30% C=0% D=65%
