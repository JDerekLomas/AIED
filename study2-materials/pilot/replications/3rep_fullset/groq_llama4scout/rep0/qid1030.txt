To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question presents two statements about the fraction \( \frac{11}{50} \): Tom claims it equals 0.11, and Katie claims it equals 22%. We need to assess who is correct.

## 2: Convert Fraction to Decimal and Percentage
To evaluate the claims, we convert \( \frac{11}{50} \) into a decimal and a percentage.
- Decimal: \( \frac{11}{50} = 0.22 \)
- Percentage: \( 0.22 \times 100 = 22\% \)

## 3: Evaluate Claims
- Tom says \( \frac{11}{50} = 0.11 \), which is incorrect because \( \frac{11}{50} = 0.22 \).
- Katie says \( \frac{11}{50} = 22\% \), which is correct because \( 0.22 = 22\% \).

## 4: Analyze Potential Errors
The common misconception here involves converting fractions to decimals and percentages. A potential error is misconverting \( \frac{11}{50} \) to 0.11 instead of 0.22. Another error could be not recognizing that 22% is equivalent to 0.22.

## 5: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level

### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with conversions and basic fraction-decimal-percentage relationships. They might not accurately convert \( \frac{11}{50} \) to a decimal or percentage.
- A (Only Tom): 20% (some might mistakenly agree with Tom)
- B (Only Katie): 40% (recognize Katie's correctness but not assess Tom's claim accurately)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 10% (unlikely to think both are correct)
- D (Neither is correct): 30% (might realize Tom is wrong but not accurately assess Katie)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make conversion errors.
- A (Only Tom): 15% (less likely to be misled by Tom's incorrect conversion)
- B (Only Katie): 60% (more likely to correctly assess Katie but not evaluate Tom's claim)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 5% (very few think both are correct)
- D (Neither is correct): 20% (some recognize both claims are incorrect)

### proficient
Students at this level are more likely to accurately convert and compare.
- A (Only Tom): 5% (unlikely to be misled by Tom)
- B (Only Katie): 80% (most recognize Katie's correctness and Tom's error)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 2% (very few believe both are correct)
- D (Neither is correct): 13% (some might still not accurately assess)

### advanced
Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of conversions and relationships.
- A (Only Tom): 1% (highly unlikely to agree with Tom's incorrect statement)
- B (Only Katie): 90% (most recognize Katie's correctness)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 0% (none believe both are correct)
- D (Neither is correct): 9% (a small percentage might still not evaluate accurately)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=1% B=90% C=0% D=9%
