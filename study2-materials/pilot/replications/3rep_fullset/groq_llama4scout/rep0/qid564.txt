To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with multiplying out brackets.

The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \( -5(m-7) \). This involves applying the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but more generally for a term outside brackets) and handling the negative sign correctly.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Process
The correct process to multiply out \( -5(m-7) \) is to distribute the \( -5 \) across the terms inside the brackets: \( -5 \times m - (-5) \times 7 \). This simplifies to \( -5m + 35 \), because \( -(-5) \times 7 = 5 \times 7 = 35 \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception is failing to distribute the negative sign correctly. Students might forget to change the sign of the term that results from multiplying a negative number by a negative number. Another error could be mishandling the signs when distributing.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( 5m + 35 \) - Incorrect distribution and wrong sign.
- B: \( -5m - 35 \) - Incorrectly kept the negative sign for the constant term.
- C: \( -5m + 35 \) - Correct answer.
- D: \( 5m - 35 \) - Incorrect distribution and wrong signs.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level

### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and sign changes. They are likely to make errors in distributing and handling signs.
- A: 30% ( incorrect but plausible for those who ignore the negative sign)
- B: 40% (common mistake of not changing the sign of the second term)
- C: 20% (some might get it right through luck or basic understanding)
- D: 10% (less likely as it involves a sign change error and incorrect coefficient)

### basic
Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still make simple mistakes.
- A: 15% 
- B: 30% 
- C: 45% (most would understand basic distribution)
- D: 10%

### proficient
These students are expected to have a solid grasp of algebraic manipulations.
- A: 5% 
- B: 10% 
- C: 80% (most get it right)
- D: 5%

### advanced
Students at this level are expected to excel in algebraic manipulations and have a deep understanding.
- A: 0% 
- B: 0% 
- C: 95% 
- D: 5% (might arise from careless mistakes)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
