To approach this question, let's first understand what rotational symmetry means. Rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a shape can be rotated by a certain angle and still look the same. The order of rotational symmetry is the number of positions a shape can be rotated into and still match its original appearance.

## Step 1: Analyze the Shape
The shape in question isn't visually provided here, but we can infer based on common shapes and their symmetries. However, since I can't see the shape, let's discuss general principles. 

## 2: Understanding Rotational Symmetry Orders
- A shape with 0 rotational symmetry (A) does not look the same after any rotation, which applies to irregular shapes.
- A shape with 1 rotational symmetry (B) looks the same only after a 360-degree rotation, essentially meaning it doesn't look the same under any other rotation, characteristic of shapes without symmetry.
- A shape with 2 rotational symmetry (C) looks the same after a 180-degree rotation.
- A shape with 4 rotational symmetry (D) looks the same after 90, 180, 270, and 360-degree rotations.

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be confusing reflection symmetry with rotational symmetry or underestimating the order of symmetry in regular polygons.

## 4: Consider the Likely Shape and Student Responses
Without the image, let's assume a common shape like a square, which has rotational symmetry of order 4. 
- Students who are below basic might not understand symmetry at all, guessing randomly or choosing 1 (B) because they think only perfect circles have high symmetry.
- Basic students might recognize some symmetry but could choose 2 (C) if they think it's less symmetric than a square or similar.
- Proficient students would likely identify a square's symmetry correctly as 4 (D).
- Advanced students would not only identify it correctly but might also explain why.

## 5: Predicting Responses
Given these considerations and assuming a simple shape like a square:
- **Below Basic**: Might guess randomly, so A=25%, B=25%, C=25%, D=25%.
- **Basic**: Could recognize some symmetry, possibly guessing 2 or 4, so A=10%, B=20%, C=40%, D=30%.
- **Proficient**: Should recognize a square has order 4 symmetry, so A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: Would definitely choose 4, with minimal errors, so A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
