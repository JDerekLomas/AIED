## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks for the area of a right-angled triangle with given side lengths: base = 11cm, slant height = 13cm, and perpendicular height = 8cm.

## 2: Recall the formula for the area of a triangle
The formula for the area of a triangle when the base and height are known is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). In this case, the base and height are given as 11cm and 8cm, respectively.

## 3: Calculate the area
Substitute the given values into the formula: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 11 \times 8 = 44 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \).

## 4: Analyze the options with respect to common misconceptions
- Option A: \( 88 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \) could be a result of doubling the calculated area or using incorrect values.
- Option B: \( 71.5 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \) seems to involve a calculation error or using the wrong formula.
- Option C: \( 1144 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \) suggests a significant miscalculation, possibly using the wrong formula or incorrect operations (e.g., multiplying instead of dividing by 2).
- Option D: \( 44 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \) matches the correct calculation.

## 5: Assess the difficulty and potential for error
The question might seem straightforward, but students need to ensure they're using the correct base and height. The presence of a "slant height" could potentially confuse some students into using it incorrectly. However, given that the perpendicular height is explicitly provided, most students who understand the area formula should be able to select the correct answer.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with the formula or confuse the sides. They might opt for C due to a miscalculation or incorrect application of the formula (\( 11 \times 13 \times 8 \)) or simply choose randomly.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should know the formula but might make calculation errors. They could choose A if they forget to divide by 2 or choose B if they incorrectly calculate.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily identify the correct base and height, calculating the area correctly as \( 44 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \), thus choosing D.
- **Advanced**: These students should not only calculate the area correctly but also quickly dismiss incorrect options, confidently choosing D.

## 7: Estimate percentages
Given the correct answer is \( 44 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \) (D), and assuming most students can correctly identify the base and height:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (incorrect calculation), B=10% (random or incorrect), C=40% (miscalculation, e.g., \( 11*8*13 \)), D=30% (correct, but through luck or basic understanding).
- **Basic**: A=30% (forgets to divide by 2), B=15% (minor calculation error), C=10% (significant error), D=45% (correct calculation).
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=5%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=0%, C=0%, D=95%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
