To approach this question, let's first understand the structure of the problem and what it's testing. The question involves a two-tier pricing system for electricity usage: one rate for the first 100 units and another rate for any units beyond that. The rates are £0.25 per unit for the first 100 units and £0.10 per unit for any additional units.

## Step 1: Calculate the Cost for the First 100 Units
The cost for the first 100 units at £0.25 per unit is \(100 \times 0.25 = £25\).

## 2: Calculate the Cost for the Remaining Units
For 1000 units, the remaining units after the first 100 are \(1000 - 100 = 900\) units. At £0.10 per unit, the cost for these units is \(900 \times 0.10 = £90\).

## 3: Total Cost
The total cost for 1000 units of electricity is \(£25 + £90 = £115\).

## 4: Analyzing the Options
Given the calculation, the correct answer is \(£115\), which corresponds to option C.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of different rates for different quantities of electricity. They might not understand how to apply the rates correctly or might make calculation errors. Given the simplicity of the numbers (£0.25 and £0.10), errors might stem from misunderstanding the question or miscalculating. Option C (correct answer) might be chosen by 20-30%, with A, B, and D being chosen by 20-30% each due to calculation errors or incorrect interpretations.
- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of basic math operations but might still struggle with applying rates. They might calculate the cost for the first 100 units and the rest correctly but could make errors in addition or multiplying. The correct answer, C, might be chosen by 50-60%, with the others being less popular.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand the pricing structure and calculate correctly. They might choose option C (correct) around 80-90% of the time, with minimal selection of other options due to good understanding and calculation skills.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong understanding of the problem and excel in calculations. They would likely choose option C almost universally (>95%) as the question does not present significant challenge beyond basic calculation skills.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
- **basic**: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=98% D=2%

The best answer is C.
