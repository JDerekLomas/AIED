To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the formula Amy should use to calculate the distance between two points, let's analyze the question and the options provided.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the correct formula to calculate the distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) on a coordinate plane. The standard formula for distance is \(\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(\sqrt{(x_2 + x_1)^2 - (y_2 + y_1)^2}\) is incorrect because it incorrectly adds \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) and \(y_1\) and \(y_2\) inside the square root and subtracts the \(y\) terms.
- Option B: \(\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\) is the correct formula for calculating the distance between two points.
- Option C: \(\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\) gives the midpoint of the line segment connecting the two points, not the distance.
- Option D: \(\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\) calculates the slope of the line connecting the two points, not the distance.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not recognize the correct formula. They might confuse it with formulas for slope or midpoint. Option B is likely to be chosen by a small percentage because it looks complex. A=20% (guessing), B=30% (some recognition but unsure), C=20% (midpoint formula), D=30% (slope formula).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of coordinate geometry. They are more likely to recognize the distance formula. B=60%, A=15%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: Students here are familiar with the distance formula and can distinguish it from other formulas. B=80%, A=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: These students not only know the formula but can also apply it efficiently. B=90%, A=2%, C=2%, D=6%.

## 4: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
- **advanced**: A=2% B=90% C=2% D=6%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=2% D=6%
