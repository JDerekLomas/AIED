## Step 1: Understand the question and the content it tests
The question asks students to find \( 50 \mathrm{~m} \) as a percentage of \( 5 \mathrm{~km} \). To solve this, students need to convert both measurements to the same unit and then calculate the percentage. The correct calculation involves converting \( 5 \mathrm{~km} \) to meters (\( 5 \mathrm{~km} = 5000 \mathrm{~m} \)) and then finding \( \frac{50}{5000} \times 100\% \) to get \( 1\% \).

## 2: Identify potential misconceptions or errors
A common misconception could be not converting units correctly or misunderstanding how to calculate percentages of quantities. However, the question's structure might mitigate some errors because it directly asks for a percentage, prompting students to think about ratios.

## 3: Consider the impact of question specifics on student errors
The numbers chosen (\( 50 \mathrm{~m} \) and \( 5 \mathrm{~km} \)) are likely to cause some students to struggle with unit conversion. \( 5 \mathrm{~km} \) to \( 50 \mathrm{~m} \) conversion might be tricky for some, but it's a straightforward calculation: \( 5 \mathrm{~km} = 5000 \mathrm{~m} \), and \( \frac{50}{5000} = 0.01 \) or \( 1\% \).

## 4: Analyze the question's difficulty across different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with unit conversions and calculating percentages. They might not convert \( 5 \mathrm{~km} \) to meters correctly or might confuse the calculation of percentages.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the concept of percentages and unit conversions but could make careless mistakes or not fully understand how to apply these concepts to the question.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to convert units and calculate percentages accurately but might still make minor errors due to oversight.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to handle the conversion and calculation with ease and accuracy.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=10% (completely off), B=60% (likely due to direct proportion misunderstanding), C=20% (thinking 50m is half of 100m, a wrong reference), D=10% (another guess).
- **Basic**: A=5% (very confident but wrong), B=80% (understanding of percentage but struggles with conversion), C=10% (halving), D=5% (random guess).
- **Proficient**: A=0% (aware it's not equal), B=90% (correct calculation), C=5% (some confusion), D=5% (might see it as 10% of 500m).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95% (very confident in calculation), C=2% (rare mistake), D=3% (unlikely but possible miscalculation).

## 6: Translate predictions into the required format
Given the nature of the question and typical student responses:
- **Below Basic**: A=5%, B=70%, C=20%, D=5%
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=0%, B=90%, C=5%, D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=3%, D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=5% B=70% C=20% D=5%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
