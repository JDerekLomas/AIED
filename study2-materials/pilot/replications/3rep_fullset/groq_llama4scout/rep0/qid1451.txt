To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the misconceptions it might trigger.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents two sequences of L-shapes made of squares and asks students to determine if either Tom or Katie (or both) correctly identifies a linear sequence. A linear sequence is one where the difference between successive terms is constant.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Sequence
Tom's sequence shows L-shapes with the bottom line increasing by 1 square each time (2 squares, 3 squares, 4 squares), which suggests a pattern. The total number of squares in each shape increases by 1, then 1 (from 3 to 4 to 5 squares if the pattern of adding one more square to the bottom each time continues), indicating a possible linear sequence in terms of the number of squares.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Sequence
Katie's sequence shows L-shapes where the total number of squares increases by 2 each time (3 squares, 5 squares, 7 squares), which clearly indicates a linear sequence because the difference between successive terms is constant (increasing by 2 squares each time).

## 4: Identifying Misconceptions
A common misconception could be failing to recognize a linear sequence or incorrectly identifying one. However, both sequences provided are straightforward, and the question seems designed to directly test understanding of linear sequences rather than to subtly trigger misconceptions.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle to understand what constitutes a linear sequence or to analyze the patterns. They might not recognize either sequence as linear or might incorrectly identify one. Given the clarity of Katie's sequence, more might correctly identify Katie. **A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%**
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of sequences and can identify simple patterns. They should recognize Katie's sequence as linear. Tom's sequence, upon closer inspection, also shows a linear increase in the number of squares (3, 4, 5...). So, **A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%**
- **Proficient:** Students here have a good grasp of linear sequences and should easily identify both sequences as linear based on the pattern of differences. **A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%**
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand linear sequences but can also analyze and explain the pattern. They will clearly see both as linear. **A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
