To approach this question, let's first understand what's being tested. The question is about factorising a quadratic equation of the form \(x^{2} + 5x + 6\). The correct method for factorising such an equation involves finding two numbers that add up to the coefficient of \(x\) (which is 5 in this case) and multiply to give the constant term (which is 6 in this case).

The equation \(x^{2} + 5x + 6\) can be factorised as \((x + 3)(x + 2)\) because 3 and 2 add up to 5 and multiply to give 6.

Let's examine the options with this in mind:

A: Add to give \(6\) and multiply to give \(5\) - Incorrect because the numbers need to add to 5 and multiply to 6.
B: Add to give \(6x\) and multiply to give \(5\) - Incorrect because it introduces \(x\) into the sum, which is not relevant.
C: Add to give \(5\) and multiply to give \(6\) - Correct, as it accurately describes the requirement for factorising \(x^{2} + 5x + 6\).
D: Add to give \(5x\) and multiply to give \(6\) - Incorrect because it incorrectly introduces \(x\) into the sum.

Given this, let's predict the performance of students at different ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the basic concept of factorising quadratic equations. They might be confused about what is being asked and could potentially choose any option that sounds plausible. However, they are less likely to understand the correct relationship.
  - A: 30% (misunderstanding of basic principles)
  - B: 20% (confusion with algebraic expressions)
  - C: 30% (some might grasp the correct relationship by chance or partial understanding)
  - D: 20% (similar confusion as B)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebraic concepts but might still make errors due to lack of practice or misunderstanding the question.
  - A: 20% (common misconception)
  - B: 15% (less likely to be chosen due to obvious incorrectness)
  - C: 50% (should understand the basic requirement for factorising)
  - D: 15% (similarly, less likely due to obvious error)

- **Proficient**: Students at this level are expected to have a solid understanding of algebraic concepts, including factorising quadratic equations. They should easily identify the correct option.
  - A: 5% (unlikely to make a basic error)
  - B: 5% (unlikely)
  - C: 85% (should confidently choose the correct option)
  - D: 5% (unlikely)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them in more complex scenarios. They are less likely to make errors on simple questions like this.
  - A: 0% (very unlikely to make such a basic error)
  - B: 0% 
  - C: 95% (high confidence in choosing the correct option)
  - D: 5% (extremely unlikely but could be due to a momentary lapse)

Based on these considerations:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
