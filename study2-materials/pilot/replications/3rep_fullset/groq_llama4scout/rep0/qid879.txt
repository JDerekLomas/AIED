To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The question asks for the gradient of a line that passes through the points (0,3) and (1,1). The formula for calculating the gradient (or slope) of a line given two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:

\[ \text{Gradient} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Substituting the given points:

\[ \text{Gradient} = \frac{1 - 3}{1 - 0} = \frac{-2}{1} = -2 \]

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question is straightforward and requires the application of the gradient formula. The points given are (0,3) and (1,1), which should lead to a calculation of \(-2\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be misapplying the formula or incorrectly calculating the differences in \(y\) and \(x\). However, given that the points are simple and the calculation is straightforward (\(-2/1 = -2\)), the main error would likely come from miscalculation or not using the correct formula.

## 3: Analyzing Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the basic algebra and formula application. They might incorrectly calculate the gradient or confuse the formula.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept and can apply it correctly but might occasionally make a careless mistake.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to not only understand but also apply concepts accurately and efficiently.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given the simplicity of the calculation:
- The correct answer is \(A = -2\).
- A likely incorrect answer due to simple miscalculation could be \(C = -1.5\), if students mistakenly calculate \(\frac{1-3}{1-0} = \frac{-2}{1} = -2\) but then get confused or make a mistake, though this seems unlikely given the direct calculation.
- Other options (\(B = -1\), \(D = -0.5\)) seem less likely as they would result from more significant miscalculations.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic:** Might have a higher chance of selecting incorrect options due to confusion or lack of understanding. Let's assume \(A=60\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=10\%\).
- **Basic:** Should have a good grasp but might make simple mistakes. Assume \(A=80\%\), \(B=10\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=5\%\).
- **Proficient:** Highly likely to get it right. Assume \(A=95\%\), \(B=3\%\), \(C=1\%\), \(D=1\%\).
- **Advanced:** Virtually all should get it right. Assume \(A=99\%\), \(B=0.5\%\), \(C=0.25\%\), \(D=0.25\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
