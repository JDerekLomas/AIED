To approach this question, let's first understand the concept being tested: the expansion of quadratic expressions in the form of \((a+b)(c+d)\). The correct method to expand \((x+5)(x-2)\) involves using the distributive property (also known as FOIL when expanding binomials):

\( (x+5)(x-2) = x(x) + x(-2) + 5(x) + 5(-2) \)

\( = x^2 - 2x + 5x - 10 \)

\( = x^2 + 3x - 10 \)

Let's analyze the options given:

A: \( x^{2}-2 x+5 x-10 \) simplifies to \( x^2 + 3x - 10 \), which is correct.

B: \( x^{2}+2 x+5 x-3 \) simplifies to \( x^2 + 7x - 3 \), which is incorrect.

C: \( x^{2}-2 x-5 x+10 \) simplifies to \( x^2 - 7x + 10 \), which is incorrect.

D: \( x^{2}-2 x+5 x+3 \) simplifies to \( x^2 + 3x + 3 \), which is incorrect.

Given this, let's predict the performance by ability level:

### below_basic:
At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and are more prone to making errors. However, the structure of the question and the options provided might still guide them towards the correct answer if they have a basic understanding of how to multiply out brackets.

- A: 40% (recognize the correct application of FOIL)
- B: 20% (might incorrectly add or subtract terms)
- C: 20% (error in signs)
- D: 20% (error in signs and constant term)

### basic:
Students at this level have a solid grasp of algebraic basics and are less likely to make careless mistakes.

- A: 60% (apply FOIL correctly)
- B: 15% (mistake in combining terms)
- C: 15% (sign error)
- D: 10% (combination of errors)

### proficient:
These students are confident in their algebraic manipulations and understand the process well.

- A: 80% (correct application of FOIL)
- B: 5% (unlikely but possible mistake)
- C: 5% (unlikely sign error)
- D: 10% (less likely combination of errors)

### advanced:
At this level, students not only apply the formula correctly but also do so efficiently and accurately.

- A: 95% (correct and efficient application)
- B: 2% (rare mistake)
- C: 2% (rare error)
- D: 1% (very unlikely)

So, the final prediction is:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
