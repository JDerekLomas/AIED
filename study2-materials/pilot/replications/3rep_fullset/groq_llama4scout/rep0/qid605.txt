To solve this, let's first interpret the information given in the bar chart description and then estimate the number of teas sold on Tuesday.

## Step 1: Understand the Bar Chart
The bar chart has a vertical scale with ticks at 0, 50, 100, etc. The Teas bar has two sections: the lower section (Monday's sales) is 1 tick below 50, and the whole bar's height (Monday + Tuesday's sales) is 2 ticks above 100.

## 2: Calculate Monday's Tea Sales
Since the lower section of the Teas bar is 1 tick below 50, and assuming each tick represents 10 units (as 0 to 50 is 5 ticks, implying 10 units per tick), Monday's tea sales are approximately 40 (since 50 - 10 = 40).

## 3: Calculate Total Tea Sales (Monday + Tuesday)
The whole Teas bar's height is 2 ticks above 100. Given that 100 is 5 ticks from 0, 2 ticks above 100 would be at the 120 mark on the scale (100 + 20 = 120). So, the total tea sales for both days are approximately 120.

## 4: Calculate Tuesday's Tea Sales
To find Tuesday's tea sales, subtract Monday's sales from the total: 120 (total) - 40 (Monday) = 80.

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with reading the chart or understanding the question. They might not accurately interpret the scale or could miscalculate. Option D (40) could appeal to those who only consider Monday's sales or misread the chart. A=10%, B=20%, C=10%, D=60%.
- **Basic:** Basic level students should be able to understand the question and attempt to solve it. They might make calculation errors. B=60%, A=15%, C=15%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students should accurately read the chart and calculate. They are less likely to make errors. A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will easily and accurately solve the problem. B=90%, A=5%, C=5%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=5% D=0%
