To approach this question, let's first analyze what makes an equation have no real solutions, particularly in the context of quadratic equations or expressions that can be simplified to quadratic form. A quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) has no real solutions if the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac < 0\). For expressions in the form of \((w - a)^2 + b = 0\) or \((w - a)^2 - b = 0\), we need to consider if the square of a real number (which is always non-negative) can ever equal a negative number.

## Step 1: Analyze Option A
Option A: \((w-4)^{2}-16=0\). This can be rearranged to \((w-4)^{2} = 16\), which has solutions \(w-4 = \pm4\), so \(w = 8\) or \(w = 0\). Thus, it has real solutions.

## 2: Analyze Option B
Option B: \((w-4)^{2}+16=0\). Here, \((w-4)^{2} = -16\). Since the square of any real number is non-negative, there are no real solutions for \(w\).

## 3: Analyze Option C
Option C: \((w-4)^{2}=0\). This equation has a solution \(w = 4\), so it has one real solution.

## 4: Analyze Option D
Option D: \((w-4)^{2}-4=0\). This can be rearranged to \((w-4)^{2} = 4\), which means \(w-4 = \pm2\), so \(w = 6\) or \(w = 2\). Thus, it has real solutions.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and understanding of quadratic equations. They might incorrectly solve or analyze the equations. Option B seems unlikely to be chosen as it directly implies a negative value under the square root, which they might recognize as problematic. However, without understanding, they might randomly select or choose an option that seems "easy." \(A=20\%\) \(B=40\%\) \(C=20\%\) \(D=20\%\)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra. They might recognize that a squared term is always positive, making Option B stand out as it directly results in a negative value. \(A=10\%\) \(B=60\%\) \(C=10\%\) \(D=20\%\)

- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with quadratic equations and their properties. They should easily identify Option B as having no real solutions because it results in a negative number being equal to a squared term. \(A=5\%\) \(B=80\%\) \(C=5\%\) \(D=10\%\)

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concept but can quickly analyze each option. They will certainly identify Option B correctly and quickly dismiss the others. \(A=2\%\) \(B=90\%\) \(C=2\%\) \(D=6\%\)

Given the analysis:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=2% D=6%
