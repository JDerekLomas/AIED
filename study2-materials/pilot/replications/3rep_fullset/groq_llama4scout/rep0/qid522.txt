To approach this question, let's first understand the content and potential pitfalls. The question requires converting and adding time units: 5 hours + 500 minutes. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Conversion Needed
To solve this, students need to convert 500 minutes into hours and minutes or directly add it to 5 hours if they convert 5 hours into minutes first. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 500 minutes is equal to 8 hours and 20 minutes (because 500 ÷ 60 = 8 remainder 20).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not converting units properly or misunderstanding how to add different units of time. However, this question is fairly straightforward as it directly involves conversion and addition.

## 3: Solving the Question
First, convert 500 minutes to hours and minutes: 500 minutes = 8 hours 20 minutes. Then add this to 5 hours: 5 hours + 8 hours 20 minutes = 13 hours 20 minutes.

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- A: 10 hours. This would be incorrect as it doesn't account for the full conversion and addition.
- B: 8 hours and 20 minutes. This is incorrect because it doesn't add the 5 hours.
- C: 13 hours and 20 minutes. This matches our calculation.
- D: 13 hours and 33 minutes. This would be incorrect as it suggests an additional 13 minutes not accounted for in our calculation.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with unit conversions and additions. They might not convert 500 minutes correctly or add the hours and minutes properly. 
  - A: 30% (simple but incorrect addition)
  - B: 20% (only adding minutes, not hours)
  - C: 30% (correct calculation, surprisingly)
  - D: 20% (miscalculation)

- **Basic:** These students have a grasp of basic concepts but might make errors in more complex calculations or conversions.
  - A: 15% (not converting properly)
  - B: 10% (not adding hours)
  - C: 60% (correct calculation)
  - D: 15% (misinterpreting the conversion)

- **Proficient:** Students at this level are expected to handle conversions and additions with ease.
  - A: 5% (careless mistake)
  - B: 5% (unlikely but possible mistake)
  - C: 80% (correct calculation)
  - D: 10% (miscalculation)

- **Advanced:** These students are likely to understand the concepts very well and make few mistakes.
  - A: 0% (unlikely)
  - B: 0% (unlikely)
  - C: 95% (correct calculation)
  - D: 5% (very rare mistake)
