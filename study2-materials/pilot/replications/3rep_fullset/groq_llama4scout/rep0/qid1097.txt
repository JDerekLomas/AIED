## Step 1: Understanding the Sequence Rule
The sequence is given by the rule \(4n + 3\), where \(n\) represents the term number in the sequence. To find the first term, we substitute \(n = 1\) into the rule.

## 2: Calculating the First Term
Substituting \(n = 1\) into the rule \(4n + 3\), we get \(4(1) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7\). This means the first term of the sequence is \(7\).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
The options given are:
- A: \(4\)
- B: \(7\)
- C: \(3\)
- D: \(43\)

## 4: Identifying the Correct Answer
From the calculation in Step 2, the correct answer is \(7\), which corresponds to option B.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the concept of a sequence rule or might struggle with substituting \(n = 1\) into the equation. They might choose option C (\(3\)) because it's a component of the rule and seems like a simple or initial part of the sequence, or they might choose A (\(4\)) because it's the coefficient of \(n\). There's also a chance they might pick D (\(43\)) due to misunderstanding or random guessing. Option B (\(7\)) might not be their immediate choice because they might not calculate it correctly.

- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to substitute \(n = 1\) into the rule but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose B (\(7\)) as it's the correct calculation, but some might choose A (\(4\)) or C (\(3\)) due to not fully understanding the rule's application. D (\(43\)) seems less likely as it requires a significant miscalculation.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level should easily substitute \(n = 1\) into the rule and get \(7\). They are likely to choose B (\(7\)) correctly. Options A (\(4\)), C (\(3\)), and D (\(43\)) should be less appealing as they require either a misunderstanding of the rule or a significant calculation error.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only calculate the first term correctly but also understand the sequence's behavior. They will likely choose B (\(7\)) without hesitation. Errors leading to other options seem unlikely.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A = 30% (might see \(4\) as a standalone number), B = 20% (correct but unsure), C = 30% (sees \(3\) in the rule), D = 20% (random or significant error).
- **Basic**: A = 10%, B = 70%, C = 10%, D = 10%.
- **Proficient**: A = 5%, B = 90%, C = 3%, D = 2%.
- **Advanced**: A = 2%, B = 95%, C = 2%, D = 1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
