To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and the potential pitfalls for students at different levels.

The question \( 0.8 + 0.2 = \) is testing the basic addition of decimals. A common misconception could involve adding or multiplying incorrectly, or misunderstanding the place value of decimals.

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations, including the addition of decimals. They might not fully understand the concept of decimals or how to add them. 
  - Option A (10) seems incorrect because it's far too large.
  - Option B (0.10) and C (0.1) are essentially the same and suggest a misunderstanding of adding decimals, possibly thinking \(0.8 + 0.2 = 0.10\) or \(0.1\), which could be a mistake if students are not secure with decimal addition.
  - Option D (1) is the correct answer.

- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a grasp of basic decimal addition but might still make careless mistakes.
  - They are likely to understand that \(0.8 + 0.2 = 1\), making option D correct. Options A, B, and C are incorrect.

- **Proficient:** Students at this level should easily add decimals and understand place value.
  - They should confidently choose option D (1) as the correct answer without hesitation.

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand decimal operations but are also likely to be secure in their understanding of more complex mathematical concepts.
  - They will also choose option D (1) without any issues.

Given these considerations, here's a prediction of the responses:

- **Below Basic:** A=20% (some might mistakenly calculate or not understand decimals), B=30% (misunderstanding of decimal places), C=20% (similar to B, with a possible misinterpretation), D=30% (some get it right by chance or basic understanding).
- **Basic:** A=5% (unlikely to make such a large error), B=10% (possible minor mistake), C=5% (similar to B), D=80% (correct understanding).
- **Proficient:** A=0% (secure in their knowledge), B=2% (rare mistake), C=2% (rare mistake), D=96% (correct).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no chance of such an error), B=0% (no mistake), C=0% (no mistake), D=100% (correct).

So, the detailed prediction in the requested format is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
proficient: A=0% B=2% C=2% D=96%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
