To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it might pose.

The question involves substituting \(x = -6\) into the equation \(y = x^2 + 4\) to find \(y\).

## Step 1: Understand the Equation and the Task
The equation given is \(y = x^2 + 4\). The task is to find \(y\) when \(x = -6\). So, we substitute \(x = -6\) into the equation:
\(y = (-6)^2 + 4 = 36 + 4 = 40\).

## 2: Identify Potential Misconceptions or Errors
A common misconception might involve incorrect handling of negative numbers or misunderstanding the order of operations. For example, some students might calculate \(y = -6^2 + 4 = -36 + 4 = -32\), incorrectly interpreting \(-6^2\) as \((-6)^2\).

## 3: Analyze Option Choices
- A: \(40\) is the correct answer.
- B: \(4\) might be chosen by someone who incorrectly thinks \(x^2 = 0\) for any \(x\), or makes a calculation error.
- C: \(-24\) could result from an incorrect calculation, such as \(y = -6^2 + 4 = -36 + 12 = -24\), though this specific error isn't straightforward from common misconceptions.
- D: \(-32\) could result from \(y = -6^2 + 4\), mistakenly calculating \(-6^2\) as \(-36\).

## 4: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic substitutions and calculations. They might choose B, C, or D due to a lack of understanding of squaring numbers or adding positive numbers. 
  - A: 20% (those who might accidentally get it right or are familiar with basic squares)
  - B: 30% (misunderstanding of \(x^2\))
  - C: 20% (possible miscalculation)
  - D: 30% (common error of \(-6^2\) instead of \(36\))

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple calculation errors or misunderstand the equation.
  - A: 60% (correct calculation)
  - B: 15% (simple mistake)
  - C: 10% (unlikely but possible miscalculation)
  - D: 15% (error with negative numbers)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the equation and can substitute correctly but might still make occasional errors under pressure.
  - A: 90% (accurate calculation)
  - B: 5% (rare mistake)
  - C: 2% (unlikely error)
  - D: 3% (occasional slip)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident and accurate in their calculations.
  - A: 98% (near perfect accuracy)
  - B: 1% (very rare error)
  - C: 0.5% (extremely unlikely)
  - D: 0.5% (extremely unlikely)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
