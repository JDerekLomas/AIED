To approach this question, let's first analyze the algebraic expression given and the potential pitfalls or simplifications involved.

The expression to simplify is: \( \frac{4 t^{2}-1}{4 t+2} \)

## Step 1: Factor the numerator
The numerator can be factored as a difference of squares: \( 4t^2 - 1 = (2t - 1)(2t + 1) \).

## 2: Rewrite the expression with the factored numerator
So, the expression becomes: \( \frac{(2t - 1)(2t + 1)}{4t + 2} \).

## 3: Factor the denominator
The denominator can be factored by taking out a common factor: \( 4t + 2 = 2(2t + 1) \).

## 4: Rewrite the expression with both numerator and denominator factored
Now, the expression is: \( \frac{(2t - 1)(2t + 1)}{2(2t + 1)} \).

## 5: Simplify the expression
We can cancel out the \( (2t + 1) \) from both the numerator and the denominator, provided that \( 2t + 1 \neq 0 \), which implies \( t \neq -\frac{1}{2} \). After cancellation, the expression simplifies to: \( \frac{2t - 1}{2} \) or \( t - \frac{1}{2} \).

## 6: Analyze potential student responses
- Option A: \( t - 1 \) seems incorrect because it doesn't match our simplification.
- Option B: \( t + \frac{1}{2} \) is also incorrect based on our simplification.
- Option C: \( t - \frac{1}{2} \) matches our simplification.
- Option D: "Does not simplify" is incorrect because we were able to simplify the expression.

## 7: Consider common misconceptions and student errors
A common error might be failing to factor the numerator or denominator correctly, or not recognizing the opportunity to cancel terms. However, this question is structured in a way that makes the correct factorization and cancellation relatively straightforward.

## 8: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with factoring and simplifying algebraic expressions. They might not correctly factor \( 4t^2 - 1 \) or might not see how to simplify the fraction after factoring. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, with potentially A and B being popular due to simple mistakes in calculation or factoring. D might also be chosen by those who don't see a way to simplify. \( A=30\% \) \( B=25\% \) \( C=20\% \) \( D=25\% \)
- **Basic:** Students here have a better grasp of basic algebra. They might still make simple errors but are more likely to attempt to factor and simplify. \( A=20\% \) \( B=15\% \) \( C=55\% \) \( D=10\% \)
- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations. They should easily factor and simplify the expression, making \( C \) the most popular choice. \( A=5\% \) \( B=5\% \) \( C=80\% \) \( D=10\% \)
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are very confident in their algebraic skills. They should have no trouble with this question. \( A=0\% \) \( B=0\% \) \( C=90\% \) \( D=10\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
