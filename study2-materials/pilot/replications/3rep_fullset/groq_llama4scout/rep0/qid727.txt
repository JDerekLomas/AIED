To tackle this, let's analyze the function machine's process step by step and consider how students at different ability levels might respond.

The function machine does the following:
1. Adds 5 to the input number.
2. Doubles the result.

## Step 1: Apply the function to the number 4
For the input number 4:
- First, add 5: \(4 + 5 = 9\)
- Then, double the result: \(9 \times 2 = 18\)

## 2: Apply the function to the number 9
For the input number 9:
- First, add 5: \(9 + 5 = 14\)
- Then, double the result: \(14 \times 2 = 28\)

## 3: Evaluate the answer choices
Given the calculations, the correct output for the inputs 4 and 9 is 18 and 28, respectively. Let's see how students at different levels might respond:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations or following instructions. They might not accurately apply the operations in sequence or might miscalculate.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic mistakes or misunderstand the sequence of operations.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the operations and can apply them correctly but might occasionally make careless mistakes.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to not only understand but also apply the operations accurately and efficiently.

## 4: Predict student responses
- **Correct Answer**: B (18 and 28)
- **Misconception/Error Analysis**:
  - A (9 and 14) might be chosen by students who only add 5 but don't double.
  - C (81 and 196) could be selected by students who incorrectly apply operations (e.g., squaring instead of doubling and adding).
  - D (-3 and -0.5) seems unlikely as it involves negative numbers not directly produced by the given operations.

## 5: Estimate percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple addition), B=20% (correct but challenging sequence), C=30% (misconceptions), D=10% (unlikely due to negative numbers)
- **Basic**: A=25% (common mistake), B=60% (correct application), C=10% (less common misconception), D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=85%, C=3%, D=2%
- **Advanced**: A=2%, B=95%, C=2%, D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=60% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
