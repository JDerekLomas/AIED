## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question involves determining the nature of two events in a probability context: picking a 'P' and picking a vowel from a bag containing all 26 letters of the alphabet. The events are picking a 'P' and picking a vowel.

## 2: Defining key terms
- **Independent events** are those where the occurrence or non-occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other.
- **Mutually exclusive events** are those that cannot occur at the same time.
- **Probability events** is a general term and not a specific classification like independent or mutually exclusive.
- **Dependant events** (or dependent events) are those where the occurrence or non-occurrence of one affects the probability of the occurrence of the other.

## 3: Analyzing the events
- There are 26 letters in total, 1 'P', and 5 vowels (A, E, I, O, U).
- The probability of picking a 'P' is 1/26.
- The probability of picking a vowel is 5/26.
- The event of picking a 'P' and the event of picking a vowel can occur at the same time if the letter 'P' is considered, but since 'P' is not a vowel, these are mutually exclusive in the context of picking one letter that is either a 'P' or a vowel exclusively. However, considering the precise definitions:
  - If you pick a 'P', you cannot pick a vowel at the same time (since you're only picking one letter), making 'picking a 'P'' and 'picking a vowel' mutually exclusive events because they cannot happen simultaneously with a single draw.

## 4: Evaluating the options
- **A: Independent events**. For two events to be independent, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B). Here, P(pick 'P' and a vowel) = 0 because you can't pick both with one draw, suggesting independence might seem plausible at first glance but is actually about the nature of the events.
- **B: Mutually exclusive events**. Since picking a 'P' and picking a vowel cannot happen at the same time (as you're drawing one letter), these are mutually exclusive.
- **C: Probability events**. This is too vague and not a classification of events.
- **D: Dependant events**. These would require that the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other, which isn't directly relevant here as the events are about a single draw.

## 5: Predicting student responses
- **below_basic**: Might not fully understand the definitions, could confuse dependent and independent, and might choose C as it mentions "probability."
  - A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
- **basic**: Understands basic definitions, might still confuse but leans towards understanding mutual exclusivity.
  - A=30% B=50% C=15% D=5%
- **proficient**: Clearly understands definitions, should recognize mutual exclusivity.
  - A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: Deeply understands the concepts, should have no trouble identifying mutual exclusivity.
  - A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=50% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
