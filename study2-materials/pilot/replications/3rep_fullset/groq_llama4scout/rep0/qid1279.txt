## Step 1: Understand the sequence and the question
The given sequence starts with 11 and increases by 4 each time: 11, 15, 19, 23, and so on. The question asks to find the position in the sequence for the number 87.

## 2: Determine the formula for the nth term
To find the position of 87 in the sequence, we first need to determine the formula for the nth term. The sequence starts at 11 and increases by 4 each time. Thus, the nth term can be represented as \(11 + (n-1) \times 4\), which simplifies to \(11 + 4n - 4\) or \(7 + 4n\).

## 3: Solve for n when the term is 87
Using the formula \(7 + 4n = 87\), we solve for \(n\):
\(4n = 87 - 7\)
\(4n = 80\)
\(n = 80 / 4\)
\(n = 20\)

## 4: Analyze the answer choices
- A: 355
- B: 20
- C: \(4n + 7\)
- D: 21.75

## 5: Evaluate the difficulty of the question for different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with sequences and algebraic manipulation. They might not correctly solve for \(n\) or might choose an answer that seems to fit a common misconception.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to understand the sequence and solve for \(n\) with some effort. They might make calculation mistakes.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve for \(n\) and recognize that \(4n + 7\) is the formula for the nth term, not the position of 87.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only solve for \(n\) correctly but also understand that option C represents the formula for the nth term, not the solution to the problem.

## 6: Predict student responses
- **Below Basic**: Might not solve the equation correctly, possibly choosing D if they incorrectly calculate or think in decimals. A=30% (guessing), B=20% (correct but struggling), C=10% (misunderstanding the question), D=40% (incorrect calculation).
- **Basic**: Should be able to solve it but might make errors. A=15%, B=70%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Easily solve for \(n\). A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: Understand the sequence and the question clearly. A=2%, B=95%, C=2%, D=1%.

## 7: Convert predictions to exact format
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
- **basic**: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced**: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
