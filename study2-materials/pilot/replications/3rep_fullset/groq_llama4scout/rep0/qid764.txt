To approach this question, let's break down the concepts involved and consider the potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The statement in question is: "Common multiples of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) are also multiples of \( 25 \)". 

First, let's clarify the concepts:
- The least common multiple (LCM) of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) is \( 10 \), because \( 10 \) is the smallest number that both \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) can divide into evenly.
- Multiples of \( 10 \) include \( 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, ... \)
- Multiples of \( 25 \) include \( 25, 50, 75, 100, ... \)

The statement is claiming that any number that is a multiple of both \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) (i.e., a multiple of \( 10 \)) is also a multiple of \( 25 \). 

## Step 1: Analyzing the Statement
The statement can be tested by finding the LCM of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \), which is \( 10 \). Clearly, \( 10 \) is not a multiple of \( 25 \), which immediately suggests that the statement is not always true.

## 2: Identifying the Error
The error in the statement seems to stem from a confusion between the LCM of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) (which is \( 10 \)) and the properties of multiples of \( 25 \). Students might mistakenly believe that because \( 50 \) is a multiple of both \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) (and also of \( 25 \)), the statement could be true, but they would overlook \( 10 \), \( 20 \), \( 30 \), etc., which are multiples of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) but not of \( 25 \).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of LCM or might struggle with the abstract thinking required. They might be inclined to believe the statement if they can think of one example where it's true (like \( 50 \)) without considering counterexamples. So, they might choose A) always true (40%), with a significant portion unsure or choosing randomly (D) Impossible to say, around 30-40%). B and C might be less popular as they require a nuanced understanding.

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a grasp of basic concepts but might still fall into simple traps. They might recognize that \( 10 \) is not a multiple of \( 25 \) but could still be swayed by examples like \( 50 \). Thus, they might lean towards B) sometimes true (40-50%), acknowledging there are cases where it's true but not universally. A smaller percentage might still choose A) always true.

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid understanding and can likely see that while \( 50 \) is a common multiple of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) and also a multiple of \( 25 \), \( 10 \) is not. They should recognize the statement is not always true. Hence, they might choose C) never true (60-70%), as they understand that being a multiple of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) doesn't necessarily make a number a multiple of \( 25 \).

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concepts but can also reason abstractly about them. They will quickly identify that the statement cannot be universally true because of counterexamples like \( 10 \), \( 20 \), etc. They are likely to choose C) never true (80-90%), as they can easily generate counterexamples and understand the logical structure of the statement.

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=45% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
