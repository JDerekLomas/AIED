## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation provided is \(2x + 3y = 12\). The table of values has \(y = 0\) and \(x\) is represented by a star \(\bigstar\). We need to find the value of \(x\) when \(y = 0\).

## 2: Solve for \(x\) when \(y = 0\)
Substitute \(y = 0\) into the equation \(2x + 3y = 12\):
\[2x + 3(0) = 12\]
\[2x = 12\]
\[x = 6\]

## 3: Analyze the potential for student errors
This question tests the ability to substitute values into an equation and solve for the variable. Given \(y = 0\), the equation simplifies to \(2x = 12\), which is a straightforward calculation. However, students might make errors if they forget to substitute \(y = 0\) correctly or miscalculate the solution.

## 4: Consider student ability levels and potential errors
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and substitutions. They might incorrectly solve the equation or not understand how to substitute \(y = 0\).
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to perform simple substitutions and solve for one variable. However, they might make careless mistakes.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are expected to accurately substitute values and solve equations. They are less likely to make errors on simple substitution questions.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of algebraic concepts and are very likely to solve the equation correctly.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
- **Below Basic**: 
  - A=20% (random guess),
  - B=20% (random guess),
  - C=40% (some understanding that \(y=0\) simplifies the equation, but calculation error),
  - D=20% (random guess).
- **Basic**:
  - A=10% (careless mistake),
  - B=10% (careless mistake),
  - C=70% (correct calculation, \(2x = 12\) so \(x = 6\)),
  - D=10% (careless mistake).
- **Proficient**:
  - A=5% (unlikely mistake),
  - B=5% (unlikely mistake),
  - C=85% (confident in algebraic manipulations),
  - D=5% (unlikely mistake).
- **Advanced**:
  - A=0% (very unlikely mistake),
  - B=0% (very unlikely mistake),
  - C=95% (strong understanding, accurate calculation),
  - D=5% (very unlikely mistake, possibly a slip).

## 6: Translate predictions into the required format
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
- **basic**: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
