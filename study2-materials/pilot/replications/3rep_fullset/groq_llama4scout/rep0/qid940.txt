To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and compare them to the given ratio of teachers to students, which is \(1:9\).

## Step 1: Understand Tom's Statement
Tom says there are \(9\) times as many students as teachers. Given the ratio \(1:9\), for every \(1\) teacher, there are \(9\) students. This means there are indeed \(9\) times as many students as teachers, making Tom's statement correct.

## 2: Understand Katie's Statement
Katie says one in ten people are teachers. The ratio given is \(1:9\), which means for every \(10\) people (\(1\) teacher \(+ 9\) students), \(1\) person is a teacher. Therefore, Katie's statement is also correct.

## 3: Analyze the Statements Together
Since both Tom and Katie's statements are correct based on the given ratio of \(1:9\), the correct answer is that both Tom and Katie are correct.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding ratios and proportions. They might find it hard to translate the ratio into a comparison of numbers or a fraction of the total. However, the straightforward nature of the statements (Tom's being a direct ratio comparison and Katie's a simple fraction) might help. Still, they might be confused: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding of ratios and can likely see that Tom's statement directly matches the ratio. Katie's statement might be understood as equivalent. Expect a higher percentage to get it right: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%.
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with ratios and proportions. They should easily see that both statements are correct and equivalent: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and can quickly see the equivalence of the statements. They are likely to get the correct answer without hesitation: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
