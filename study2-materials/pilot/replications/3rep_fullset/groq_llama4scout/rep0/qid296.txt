## Step 1: Understand the quadratic formula and its application
The quadratic formula to solve equations of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. For the given equation $5h^2 - 3h - 2 = 0$, we have $a = 5$, $b = -3$, and $c = -2$.

## 2: Apply the quadratic formula to the given equation
Substituting $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the quadratic formula gives us $h = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot (-2)}}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 40}}{10} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{10}$.

## 3: Identify the components of the quadratic formula in the given problem
The expression under the square root in the quadratic formula is $b^2 - 4ac$, which for our equation is $9 + 40 = 49$. The denominator is $2a$, which is $10$ in this case.

## 4: Compare with the given expression
The given expression is $\frac{?\pm \sqrt{9-(-40)}}{?}$. Simplifying inside the square root gives $\sqrt{9 + 40} = \sqrt{49}$.

## 5: Determine the correct values for the expression
The correct expression should be $\frac{?\pm \sqrt{49}}{?}$. Comparing this to our derived formula, $\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{10}$, it's clear that $?$ should equal $10$ (the denominator) and $\sqrt{49}$ equals $7$, so the expression inside the square root in the given problem, $9-(-40)$, indeed equals $49$.

## 6: Evaluate the answer choices based on the quadratic formula
Given that $\sqrt{9-(-40)} = \sqrt{49}$, the value under the square root is $49$. Thus, we are looking for an answer that corresponds to $49$ when considering the structure of the question.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the quadratic formula and algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly calculate $9 - (-40)$ or might confuse the formula. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of the quadratic formula but might make careless mistakes. They should recognize the $49$ but might not correctly fill in the rest of the formula.
- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with the quadratic formula and should easily identify that $9 - (-40) = 49$. They are likely to choose the correct option related to $49$.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are not only familiar with the formula but also understand its implications and can apply it with ease. They should quickly identify the correct answer.

## 8: Assign percentages based on understanding and common misconceptions
- The expression to replace the square is directly derived from $b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4(5)(-2) = 9 + 40 = 49$.
- **Below Basic**: A=0% B=20% C=60% D=20% (struggle with calculations and formula application)
- **Basic**: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10% (mostly get it right but some confusion)
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5% (strong understanding, minor errors)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5% (very confident in their calculations)

The best answer is C. 

Below_basic: A=0% B=20% C=60% D=20%
Basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
