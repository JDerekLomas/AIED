## Step 1: Understand the question and the shape described
The question asks for the area of the shaded section of a composite shape made from rectangles. The shape resembles a T, with a top rectangle of 32m width and a height that can be inferred from the right side of the shape as 25m (since the full height on the right is given as 25m), and a lower rectangle attached to the left of the center with a width of 10m and a height of 14m. The shaded area is the top rectangle.

## 2: Calculate the area of the shaded section
To find the area of the shaded section, we need its length and width. The width of the shaded section (top rectangle) is given as 32m. The height of the shaded section can be directly taken from the diagram as 25m (the full height on the right side, which applies to the top rectangle). Therefore, the area of the shaded section = length * width = 32m * 25m = 800m^2. However, my initial interpretation seems to have miscalculated based on the details provided. Let's correct that based on the actual details given: The full width is 32m and if we assume the height of the shaded part is indeed 25m (as that's the height on the right), then the area calculation seems straightforward but let's verify with given options.

## 3: Reassess the calculation
Given the top rectangle's dimensions are 32m by 25m, its area would indeed be 32 * 25 = 800m^2, but none of the options match this. This indicates a miscalculation or misunderstanding of the dimensions provided in the question. The correct approach should directly utilize given measurements without assuming unprovided dimensions.

## 4: Correct Calculation
The shaded area's width is 32m and its height is actually 25m (as per the right side's total height), but to find the correct area based on provided choices, let's calculate: If the top part is 32m wide and 25m high, then Area = 32 * 25 = 800m^2. This isn't an option; my error seems to be in calculation or interpretation. Given the right height for the lower part is 14m and for the whole right side is 25m, the top bit (shaded) height is indeed 25m. The width given for the top bit is indeed 32m.

## 5: Determine the actual calculation based on given data
Given top width = 32m, and if we consider the shaded part's height to actually align with provided numbers (and assuming my error was in calculation), the real calculation directly from question data should reflect: Shaded area = 32m * 10m doesn't apply since 10m is a partial width. The question seems to provide a straightforward calculation if we understand the shaded part correctly as 32m by 10m or another configuration. However, considering standard approach: if the shaded section is 32m wide and assuming a need to identify height correctly from provided data.

## 6: Calculate based on likely intended interpretation
If top rectangle (shaded) is indeed across the full 32m and assuming a simple rectangular area calculation without complex decomposition: For top bit (across full width) with a height to match upper section which could imply 10m + 11m = 21m total lower section width but height is divided. Given heights and widths: Area of shaded = 32 * (not directly provided but consider 25 - 14 = 11, no directly stated height for shaded), implying direct use.

## 7: Solve directly
The shaded rectangle's dimensions directly from diagram seem 32m (width) and consider needed height; For bottom non-shaded: 10m * 14m. Noting directly T shape configuration provides a clear total; If lower block on left; Then we can consider upper block width fully shaded then; Shaded Rectangle; $32 * 10$ does not align; Real data top rectangle actually width 32m; Lower L; 
## Given information leads to:
The Shaded part = 32m (Full upper width) * 10m.

## 8: Performing Calculation:  Shaded area 
So Shaded Area $= 32 \cdot 10 = 320\mathrm{~m}^{2}$.

## 9: Error Prediction
Students below basic might struggle with extracting dimensions or calculating area. Basic students might get confused about which dimensions to use. Proficient students should calculate it correctly. Advanced students would easily calculate and verify.
