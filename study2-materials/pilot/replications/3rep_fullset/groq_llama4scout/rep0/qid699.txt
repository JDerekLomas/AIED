## Step 1: Understand the question and the statements made by Tom and Katie.
The question provides the heights of 5 plants and asks us to evaluate the statements made by Tom and Katie regarding changes in these heights. Tom claims that if all plants double in height, the range of heights won't change. Katie claims that if all plants grow by 12 cm, the range won't change.

## 2: Calculate the original range of plant heights.
To assess their statements, first, we need to find the original range. The heights given are 23 cm, 17 cm, 40 cm, 25 cm, and 31 cm. The smallest height is 17 cm, and the largest is 40 cm. The range is the difference between the largest and smallest heights: \(40 - 17 = 23\) cm.

## 3: Evaluate Tom's statement - If all plants double in height, the range won't change.
If all plants double in height, their new heights will be: \(46, 34, 80, 50, 62\) cm. The new smallest height is 34 cm, and the new largest height is 80 cm. The new range is \(80 - 34 = 46\) cm. Since \(46 \neq 23 \times 2\), but actually, the range does change because it is scaled by 2, Tom is incorrect. The range doubles when all values double.

## 4: Evaluate Katie's statement - If all plants grow by 12 cm, the range won't change.
If all plants grow by 12 cm, their new heights will be: \(35, 29, 52, 37, 43\) cm. The new smallest height is 29 cm, and the new largest height is 52 cm. The new range is \(52 - 29 = 23\) cm. Since \(23 = 23\), Katie is correct; the range remains unchanged when a constant is added to all values.

## 5: Determine the correctness of Tom and Katie's statements.
Tom is incorrect because doubling all heights doubles the range. Katie is correct because adding the same value to all heights does not change the range.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of range and how changes in data affect it. They might not fully grasp the implications of doubling or adding a constant to all values. Expect a high chance of choosing incorrectly, possibly A or D, due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying concepts to new situations. They might incorrectly agree with Tom or disagree with both without fully understanding why Katie is correct. Expect some to choose A, B, or D, but with a better grasp than below basic.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts of range and how linear transformations affect it. They should recognize Katie's statement as correct and Tom's as incorrect, leading to a likely choice of B.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately and reason about the effects of different operations on data sets. They should easily identify Katie as correct and Tom as incorrect, also choosing B.

## 7: Estimate percentages for each ability level.
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (misunderstanding Tom's statement), B=20% (not understanding Katie's correctness), C=10% (unlikely to understand both correctly), D=30% (complete misunderstanding).
- **Basic**: A=30%, B=40%, C=15%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=15%, B=60%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=80%, C=5%, D=10%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
