## Step 1: Understand the sequence and the question
The sequence is given by \( u_{n} = 1 - 3n \), and we need to find the 15th term, \( u_{15} \).

## 2: Calculate the 15th term
To find \( u_{15} \), substitute \( n = 15 \) into the formula: \( u_{15} = 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -44 \).

## 3: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer is \( -44 \), which corresponds to option A.

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions or errors
A common misconception might involve incorrect substitution or calculation. For example, some students might calculate \( u_{15} \) as \( 1 - 3 + 15 \) or incorrectly multiply \( 3 \times 15 \) as \( 30 \) instead of \( 45 \).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substitution and calculation. They might incorrectly calculate \( 3 \times 15 \) or forget to subtract 3n from 1. Expect a high chance of errors.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes or misunderstand the sequence formula. They are likely to attempt the calculation but might get it wrong due to careless errors.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the formula and can calculate it correctly but might still be prone to minor errors under pressure.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of the concept and calculate the term accurately without issues.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some get it right by chance), B=20% (error in calculation), C=30% (simple mistake, e.g., \( 1 - 15 = -14 \)), D=30% (another type of error).
- **Basic**: A=60% (most get it right), B=15% (calculation error), C=10% (simple arithmetic mistake), D=15% (error in calculation or misunderstanding).
- **Proficient**: A=85% (most calculate correctly), B=5% (minor calculation error), C=5% (simple mistake), D=5% (error).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (almost all get it right), B=2.5% (rare error), C=2.5% (rare simple mistake), D=0% (unlikely to choose incorrect options).

## 7: Refine estimates based on the question's specifics
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation, errors are likely to be minimal even among lower-ability students, especially since the calculation involves simple arithmetic.

## 8: Assign specific percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=30%, B=25%, C=20%, D=25%
- **Basic**: A=70%, B=15%, C=10%, D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=1%, D=0%

The best answer is A.
