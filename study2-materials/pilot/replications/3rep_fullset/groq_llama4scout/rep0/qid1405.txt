To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it presents.

The question provides a graph of a vertical line that goes through a point on the x-axis. The point is one box to the right of -10, and there are 5 boxes between 0 and -10. This implies that each box represents 2 units on the x-axis (since -10 divided into 5 parts equals 2 units per part). Therefore, the point is at -10 + 2 = -8.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to identify the equation of a vertical line that passes through the point -8 on the x-axis. A vertical line's equation is of the form \(x = a\), where \(a\) is the x-coordinate of any point on the line.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be confusing the equation of a vertical line with that of a horizontal line. The equation of a horizontal line is \(y = b\), where \(b\) is the y-coordinate of any point on the line. For a vertical line passing through \((-8, 0)\) or any other point with an x-coordinate of -8, the equation is \(x = -8\).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(y = 10\). This is the equation of a horizontal line, not a vertical line, and it does not pass through the point indicated.
- Option B: \(x = -9\). This suggests a vertical line but one unit to the left of the correct position.
- Option C: \(x = -8\). This is the correct equation for a vertical line passing through the point indicated on the graph.
- Option D: \(y = -8\). This is the equation of a horizontal line, not a vertical line.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of equations of lines and how to read a graph. They might confuse vertical and horizontal lines. Option A (\(y=10\)) and Option D (\(y=-8\)) might seem plausible as they represent lines, just not the correct type. Option C (\(x=-8\)) is likely to be chosen by those who understand the concept of a vertical line but might make calculation errors, placing them at around 20-30%. Option B (\(x=-9\)) could be chosen by those slightly better at calculations but still confused, around 10-20%. 
    - Below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make simple mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the line as vertical and thus choose between B and C. 
    - Basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts well and should easily identify the line as vertical and its equation. 
    - Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but are also adept at applying them. They should have no trouble identifying the correct equation.
    - Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
