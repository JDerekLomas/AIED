## Step 1: Understand the question and the graph
The question provides a graph showing Jadon's distance over time and asks us to interpret the gradient of the negative sloping section of the graph, which is given as 0.5. This gradient represents a change in distance over a change in time, which is essentially speed. However, since the line is sloping downwards, it indicates that Jadon is moving back towards his starting point.

## 2: Interpret the meaning of the gradient in the context of the graph
The gradient of a distance-time graph represents speed. A negative gradient indicates movement in the opposite direction to what was initially considered positive (in this case, back towards home). The gradient being 0.5 means that for every second, Jadon covers 0.5 meters back towards his starting point.

## 3: Analyze the answer choices
- A: Jadon is travelling away from home at a speed of \( 0.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \). This would be correct if the gradient were positive and represented the initial part of the journey away from home, but it doesn't match the negative sloping section.
- B: Jadon is decelerating at a rate of \( 0.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2} \). Deceleration refers to a decrease in speed over time, which would be relevant if we were discussing the change in speed, not directly the gradient of a distance-time graph.
- C: Jadon is accelerating at a rate of \( 0.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2} \). This choice refers to an increase in speed over time and is not directly related to the gradient of the distance-time graph provided.
- D: Jadon is travelling back home at a speed of \( 0.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \). This directly relates to the negative slope of the graph, indicating movement back towards the starting point.

## 4: Consider student understanding at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle to understand the concept of gradient in a distance-time graph and might confuse speed with acceleration or deceleration. They might choose A or C due to a lack of understanding of what the gradient represents.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand that the gradient represents speed but could be confused about the direction and might choose A if they misunderstand the direction of travel or B/C if they confuse speed with acceleration/deceleration.
- **Proficient**: These students should understand that the gradient of a distance-time graph represents speed and that a negative gradient indicates movement back towards the starting point. They are likely to choose D.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the basic concepts but can also apply them accurately. They will choose D as it correctly represents the speed at which Jadon is travelling back home.

## 5: Predict student responses
Given the specific question and the common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
- **Proficient**: A=10% B=15% C=10% D=65%
- **Advanced**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=10% D=65%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
