## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks students to solve the equation \(x^{2}-x-9=-6\) using a graph of \(y = x^{2} - x - 9\). The equation can be rearranged to \(x^{2}-x-3=0\), which is not directly solvable through simple inspection but can be solved graphically or through the quadratic formula.

## 2: Identify the solution method
To solve \(x^{2}-x-9=-6\), one can rearrange it to \(x^{2}-x-3=0\) and then use the quadratic formula, \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a=1\), \(b=-1\), and \(c=-3\). Alternatively, solutions can be approximated graphically by finding where \(y = x^{2} - x - 9\) intersects \(y = -6\), which simplifies to finding where \(y = x^{2} - x - 3\) intersects \(y = 0\).

## 3: Solve the equation
Using the quadratic formula:
\[x = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^{2} - 4(1)(-3)}}{2(1)}\]
\[x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 12}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}\]
\[x \approx \frac{1 \pm 3.61}{2}\]
So, \(x \approx 2.305\) or \(x \approx -1.305\).

## 4: Compare solutions to answer choices
- \(x \approx 2.2, \quad x \approx -1.2\) (when rounded to one decimal place) matches option C.
- The other options do not match these solutions.

## 5: Assess difficulty and potential misconceptions
This question requires graphical interpretation and solving a quadratic equation. A common misconception might be misinterpreting the graph or not solving the equation correctly. However, the provided graph and the straightforward nature of solving \(x^{2}-x-3=0\) make it less prone to errors for proficient students.

## 6: Estimate student responses by ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle to solve the quadratic equation or interpret the graph correctly. They might choose A or D due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students could attempt to solve it but might make calculation errors. They might lean towards B or C but could also choose A or D.
- **Proficient**: Students should accurately solve the equation or use the graph effectively, likely choosing C.
- **Advanced**: Students would easily solve the equation and choose C, with possibly some verifying their answers graphically.

## 7: Assign percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (guessing or incorrect calculation), B=20% (may see graph but misinterpret), C=30% (some may get close), D=10% (recognize no easy solution).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=20%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=5%, C=90%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
