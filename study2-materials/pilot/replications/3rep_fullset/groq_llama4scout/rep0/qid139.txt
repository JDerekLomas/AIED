To solve this, let's consider the nature of the question and the common misconceptions students might have.

The question asks students to multiply two terms indicated by arrows in the brackets \((5p-4)(2p-3)\), specifically \(-4\) from the first bracket and \(-3\) from the second bracket. The calculation required is \((-4) \times (-3)\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculation
The calculation \((-4) \times (-3) = 12\). This is a basic multiplication of two negative numbers, which results in a positive number.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be that students forget that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. Some might think \(-4 \times -3 = -12\), incorrectly applying the rule for adding or subtracting negatives.

## 3: Assessing Difficulty Level
Given that the question directly points to the terms to be multiplied and the operation is straightforward, it seems like it should be relatively easy for most students, assuming they remember the rule about multiplying negative numbers.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication or remembering rules about negative numbers. They might choose \(B) -12\) (thinking negatives make a negative) or struggle to calculate, potentially selecting \(D) -7\) or \(A) +7\) due to a complete misunderstanding. However, given the direct nature of the question, \(C) +12\) seems likely for those who do recall the rule, but let's assume a significant portion would incorrectly choose \(B) -12\) or struggle, so: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a better grasp but might still make careless mistakes. Expect a significant portion to get it right: A=5% B=30% C=60% D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to get it right, understanding the multiplication of negatives: A=2% B=10% C=85% D=3%.
- **Advanced**: For advanced students, this is straightforward: A=1% B=5% C=92% D=2%.

## 5: Formatting the Response
Given these predictions:
- below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
- basic: A=5% B=30% C=60% D=5%
- proficient: A=2% B=10% C=85% D=3%
- advanced: A=1% B=5% C=92% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=30% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=10% C=85% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=5% C=92% D=2%
