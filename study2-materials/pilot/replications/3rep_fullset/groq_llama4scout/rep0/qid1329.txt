## Step 1: Understand the question
The question requires students to add two fractions, $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{10}$, and then express the sum as a fraction with a denominator of $30$. The goal is to find the numerator of this resulting fraction, denoted by $\bigstar$.

## 2: Solve the problem
To add $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{10}$, we need a common denominator, which in this case can be $30$. So, we convert each fraction: $\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 10}{3 \times 10} = \frac{10}{30}$ and $\frac{1}{10} = \frac{1 \times 3}{10 \times 3} = \frac{3}{30}$. Then, we add them: $\frac{10}{30} + \frac{3}{30} = \frac{13}{30}$. Therefore, $\bigstar = 13$.

## 3: Analyze potential misconceptions and difficulty levels
The question tests the ability to add fractions with different denominators and to express the result with a specified denominator. A common misconception might involve adding the numerators and denominators separately or failing to find a common denominator. However, the structure of this question, with the answer choices provided, might guide students towards the correct method.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with finding a common denominator or adding fractions. They might add the numerators ($1+1=2$) and the denominators ($3+10=13$), or simply not understand how to proceed, leading to random or incorrect answers. Given the simplicity of the fractions and the provided answer choices, some might guess or incorrectly calculate, possibly leading to: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make procedural errors. They are likely to find a common denominator and attempt to add the fractions but might make calculation mistakes. The correct answer, A=13, seems straightforward, but without calculation: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand fraction addition and can find a common denominator. They should accurately calculate $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{10}{30} + \frac{3}{30} = \frac{13}{30}$. Thus, they should predominantly choose A: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the procedures but can also apply them efficiently. They should quickly and accurately find that $\bigstar = 13$, with minimal chance of error: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%.

## 5: Format the predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
- proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
