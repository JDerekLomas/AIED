To solve this, let's first understand the concept of reflecting a point across the line \(y = -x\). When a point \((x, y)\) is reflected across the line \(y = -x\), its new coordinates become \((-y, -x)\). This is because the line \(y = -x\) acts as a mirror, swapping the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates and changing their signs.

Given that point \(P\) is at \((0, 5)\), applying the reflection across \(y = -x\), we get the new coordinates of \(P\) as \((-5, 0)\).

Now, let's analyze the options and predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **A: \((-5, 0)\)** - This is the correct answer.
- **B: \((-4, -1)\)** - This would be an incorrect transformation.
- **C: \((-2, 2)\)** - This seems to be a mistaken attempt at reflection or transformation.
- **D: \((-4, 5)\)** - This seems to misunderstand the reflection process entirely.

## Predictions by Ability Level:

### below_basic
- A: 20% (might get it by chance or partially understand reflection)
- B: 30% (common error, not understanding reflection)
- C: 30% (another common miscalculation)
- D: 20% (complete misunderstanding)

### basic
- A: 50% (starting to grasp reflection concept, might make careless errors)
- B: 25% (some still confused about the correct process)
- C: 15% (less common mistake as they understand basic transformations)
- D: 10% (significant misunderstanding)

### proficient
- A: 80% (good understanding of reflection across \(y = -x\))
- B: 10% (careless mistake or not fully paying attention)
- C: 5% (unlikely to make such a basic error)
- D: 5% (minimal chance of significant misunderstanding)

### advanced
- A: 95% (excellent understanding, very few make errors)
- B: 3% (rare careless mistake)
- C: 1% (extremely unlikely to make such an error)
- D: 1% (also extremely unlikely)

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
