To solve this, let's first understand the question. The diagram shows a bar divided into 4 equal sections, with one of these sections colored green and further divided into 2 equal sections. The question asks which calculation gives the fraction that replaces the question mark, which represents the width of one of the smaller green sections.

## Step 1: Understanding the Diagram
The entire bar is divided into 4 equal parts, so each part represents \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the whole. The green section is 2 of these parts, so it represents \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \) of the whole. However, the green section is further divided into 2 equal parts, and we are interested in the fraction of the whole that one of these smaller parts represents.

## 2: Identifying the Fraction for the Question Mark
Since the green section is \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the whole and it's divided into 2 equal parts, each smaller part represents \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the whole. Alternatively, if the whole is divided into 8 equal parts (since 4 sections are each divided into 2), then each smaller part represents \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the whole.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{5} \)
- B: \( \frac{1}{4} \div \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{1}{2} \)
- C: \( \frac{2}{5} \div 2 = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{5} \)
- D: \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \)

## 4: Determining the Correct Option
The fraction that one of the smaller green sections represents is \( \frac{1}{8} \). Let's see which option equals \( \frac{1}{8} \):
- \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \), which matches option D.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with fractions and division. They might choose A or C because they seem to involve simple operations, but they won't accurately reflect the diagram's request. Option D seems less likely to be chosen by below-basic students due to its accuracy and the level of understanding required. 
  - A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- **Basic**: Basic level students will have a better grasp of fractions but might still struggle with the relationship between the parts. They might be tempted by A or C due to simple calculation appeal.
  - A=20% B=25% C=20% D=35%
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand fractions well and should easily identify the correct calculation. They are less likely to choose A, B, or C.
  - A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will quickly and accurately determine the correct answer. The question might seem straightforward to them.
  - A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=20% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
