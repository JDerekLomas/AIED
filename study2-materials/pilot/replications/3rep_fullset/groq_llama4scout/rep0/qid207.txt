To solve this, let's first expand and simplify the given expression: \(x(3x - 5) + 6(2x - 3)\).

## Step 1: Expand the expression
Expanding \(x(3x - 5)\) gives \(3x^2 - 5x\), and expanding \(6(2x - 3)\) gives \(12x - 18\).

## 2: Combine like terms
Combining these, we get \(3x^2 - 5x + 12x - 18\), which simplifies to \(3x^2 + 7x - 18\).

## 3: Match with \(Px^2 + Qx + R\)
Matching this with \(Px^2 + Qx + R\), we find \(P = 3\), \(Q = 7\), and \(R = -18\).

## 4: Identify the value of \(R\)
The value of \(R\) is \(-18\), which corresponds to option B.

## 5: Analyze potential student errors
The question asks us to predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option. The correct answer is straightforward to find by expanding and simplifying the given expression. However, to assess potential errors, we consider common misconceptions or difficulties students might have.

## 6: Consider common errors
A common error could be in the distribution or combining of terms. For instance, incorrectly expanding \(x(3x - 5)\) to \(3x - 5x\) (forgetting the \(x\) multiplication) or \(6(2x - 3)\) to \(12 - 18\) (forgetting to distribute \(6\) to \(2x\)). However, the question specifically asks for \(R\), which comes from the constant term \(-18\), making it less prone to errors related to \(x\) terms.

## 7: Assess difficulty by ability level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and could easily make errors in expanding or combining terms. They might not even attempt to simplify or could incorrectly calculate \(R\).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes or struggle with distributing and combining like terms. They are more likely to get it right than below basic but could still be distracted by incorrect options.
- **Proficient:** These students are expected to handle algebraic expressions with ease, including expanding and simplifying. They are less likely to make errors in finding \(R\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and are likely to quickly and accurately solve for \(R\).

## 8: Predict error rates
Given the straightforward nature of finding \(R\) directly from the constant term in the expansion:
- **Below Basic:** A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40% (high error rate, guessing)
- **Basic:** A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5% (mostly correct, some guessing)
- **Proficient:** A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1% (very high accuracy)
- **Advanced:** A=1% B=98% C=1% D=0% (extremely high accuracy)

The best answer is B. 

Below_basic: A=5% B=60% C=20% D=15%
Basic: A=2% B=85% C=10% D=3%
Proficient: A=1% B=98% C=1% D=0%
Advanced: A=0% B=99% C=1% D=0%
