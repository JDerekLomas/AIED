To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to multiplying negative numbers.

The question asks to identify the incorrect calculation among the given options:
A: \( (-7) \times 2=-14 \)
B: \( (-7) \times(-2)=-14 \)
C: \( 7 \times 2=14 \)
D: \( 7 \times(-2)=-14 \)

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception when multiplying negative numbers is forgetting that two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive result, and a negative number multiplied by a positive number gives a negative result.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A: \( (-7) \times 2 = -14 \). This is correct because a negative times a positive gives a negative.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B: \( (-7) \times(-2) = -14 \). This is incorrect because two negatives multiplied together should give a positive, so \( (-7) \times(-2) = 14 \).

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \). This is a basic multiplication fact and is correct.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D: \( 7 \times(-2) = -14 \). This is correct because a positive times a negative gives a negative.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts and the concept of negative numbers. They might incorrectly choose options that seem plausible or make common errors. Option B is likely to be chosen by a significant number because it tests the understanding of negative number multiplication, which can be tricky.  
  - A=60% (gets it right, simple fact)
  - B=20% (common misconception)
  - C=10% (basic fact, might get confused)
  - D=10% (basic fact, might get confused)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of basic facts but might still struggle with more complex concepts like negative numbers.
  - A=80%
  - B=15% (still a bit tricky)
  - C=2%
  - D=3%

- **Proficient**: These students understand multiplication facts and have a good grasp of negative numbers.
  - A=95%
  - B=3% (less likely to fall for the misconception)
  - C=1%
  - D=1%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately. They are less likely to make errors.
  - A=99%
  - B=1%
  - C=0%
  - D=0%

## 7: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
