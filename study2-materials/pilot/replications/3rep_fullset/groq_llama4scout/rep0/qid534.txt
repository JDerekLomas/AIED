To solve this, let's first perform the subtraction that Isaac intends:

\[
(6g + h) - (6g - 3h) = 12 - (-3)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
6g + h - 6g + 3h = 12 + 3
\]

Which further simplifies to:

\[
4h = 15
\]

So, the correct answer is D) \(4h = 15\).

Now, let's analyze the potential for errors based on student ability levels:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations or understanding the process of solving simultaneous equations. They might not correctly perform the subtraction or might not understand the concept of eliminating a variable. However, the straightforward nature of this specific question (involving simple numbers and a clear step of subtraction) means that even students who are below basic might be able to follow the operation and see that subtracting one equation from the other eliminates \(g\) and results in \(4h = 15\). But, given the nature of the question, there might still be a significant chance of errors due to lack of understanding or careless mistakes. 
  - A: \(20\%\)
  - B: \(15\%\)
  - C: \(10\%\)
  - D: \(55\%\)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of algebra and can typically perform simple manipulations. They are less likely to make errors in basic arithmetic or simple algebraic steps. The question is quite straightforward, so most basic students should be able to get it right.
  - A: \(5\%\)
  - B: \(5\%\)
  - C: \(5\%\)
  - D: \(85\%\)

- **Proficient:** Students at this level have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts and can apply them to solve problems efficiently. They are likely to perform the subtraction correctly and understand the implications of their actions.
  - A: \(2\%\)
  - B: \(2\%\)
  - C: \(2\%\)
  - D: \(94\%\)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand algebraic concepts well but can also apply them to more complex problems. They would easily and quickly solve this, with minimal chance of error.
  - A: \(1\%\)
  - B: \(1\%\)
  - C: \(1\%\)
  - D: \(97\%\)

Given the format and my analysis:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=2% D=94%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%
