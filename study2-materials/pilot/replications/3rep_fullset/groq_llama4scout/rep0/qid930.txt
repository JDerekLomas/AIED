To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question presents a probability spinner with 5 equal sections, where 2 sections are labelled with a blue number 1, and 3 sections are labelled with a red number 2. The task is to determine the correct sample space.

## Step 1: Understanding the Sample Space
The sample space in probability theory is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. For the given spinner, the outcomes are the numbers that can be landed on: 1 or 2.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom says the sample space can be written as \( S=\{1,2\} \). This representation is correct in terms of the unique outcomes of spinning the spinner. It does not account for the frequency or probability of each outcome but lists all possible outcomes.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie says the sample space can be written as \( S=\{1,1,2,2,2\} \). This representation seems to account for the frequency of each outcome (2 sections with 1 and 3 sections with 2), which could be interpreted as listing each possible spin outcome individually. However, in standard probability theory, the sample space for this spinner would indeed focus on the unique outcomes {1,2} rather than listing repetitions.

## 4: Identifying Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to think that the sample space must reflect the frequency of outcomes (as Katie suggests) rather than just the unique outcomes. However, the sample space \( S=\{1,2\} \) is appropriate for defining the possible outcomes without implying unequal probabilities.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding what a sample space represents. They might be confused by Katie's listing and think it represents every spin individually, or they might not understand that Tom's is a simplified version. They might lean towards B (Only Katie) because it seems to account for all sections of the spinner, or D (Neither is correct) if they see both as incorrect for different reasons. A=10%, B=40%, C=20%, D=30%.

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding of probability. They might recognize Tom's answer as correct because it lists unique outcomes but could be swayed by Katie's detailed listing. They might start to see that both could be argued for different reasons but would likely recognize Tom's as the standard approach. A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand that the sample space consists of unique outcomes. They recognize Tom's \( S=\{1,2\} \) as correct. They might see Katie's as an attempt to list every possible spin but understand it's not standard for defining a sample space in this context. A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students have a deep understanding of probability concepts. They will clearly see Tom's representation as the conventional and correct sample space for this scenario. They might appreciate Katie's attempt to reflect the spinner's composition but understand it's not necessary for defining the sample space. A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
