To approach this question, let's first understand the formula for the area of a trapezium, which is given by \( \text{Area} = \left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)h \), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \(h\) is the perpendicular height between the parallel sides.

## Step 1: Identify the parallel sides and the height of the trapezium.
From the diagram provided, the parallel sides are labelled as 9cm and 10cm, and the perpendicular height is labelled as 6cm. The non-parallel sides are 7cm and 7.5cm, which are not needed for calculating the area using the formula.

## 2: Determine the correct values for \(a\) and \(b\).
Given the formula, \(a\) and \(b\) must be the lengths of the parallel sides. Therefore, \(a = 9\) and \(b = 10\), or vice versa, since the choice of \(a\) and \(b\) is arbitrary.

## 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on the correct understanding.
- A: \(7 + 7.5\) suggests using the non-parallel sides, which is incorrect.
- B: \(9 + 10\) suggests using the parallel sides, which is correct.
- C: \(7 + 6\) suggests using one non-parallel side and the height, which is incorrect.
- D: \(6 + 7.5\) suggests using the height and one non-parallel side, which is incorrect.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand the basic properties of a trapezium or might confuse the formula. They are likely to choose options that seem to add any two numbers together without understanding the context. Option B seems correct but might not be chosen by those who don't recognize the parallel sides. Expect a spread across incorrect options.
- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might be prone to simple errors. They should recognize the parallel sides but might get confused with the formula. Expect a higher percentage choosing B but some might still opt for A, C, or D due to confusion.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level understand the geometry and the formula. They should easily identify \(a = 9\) and \(b = 10\), making B the correct choice. Few should choose incorrect options.
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the geometry and formula but are also less likely to make careless mistakes. They should all choose B.

## 5: Assign percentages.
Given the question's clarity and the straightforward nature of identifying parallel sides, even students who are not advanced should be able to get this right. However, the percentage choosing the correct answer will increase with ability level.

- **Below Basic:** A=40% (simple addition of given numbers), B=30% (correct but might not understand why), C=15%, D=15%.
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=95%, C=2.5%, D=2.5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2.5% D=2.5%
