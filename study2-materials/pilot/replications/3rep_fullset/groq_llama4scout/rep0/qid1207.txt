To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions it may trigger, then predict the performance of students at different ability levels.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question tests the understanding of equivalent expressions, specifically focusing on the commutative property of multiplication and the concept of reciprocal. Tom's statement suggests that \( \frac{p}{q} \) is equivalent to \( \frac{q}{p} \), which is incorrect unless \( p = q \) or \( p = -q \) (in the case of considering negative values). Katie's statement that \( pq \) is equivalent to \( qp \) is correct due to the commutative property of multiplication.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom's statement \( \frac{p}{q} = \frac{q}{p} \) implies \( p^2 = q^2 \), which is only true if \( p = q \) or \( p = -q \). This is a specific condition and not a general rule, making Tom's statement generally incorrect without additional context.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie's statement \( pq = qp \) is correct due to the commutative property of multiplication, which states that the order of the factors does not change the product.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic concepts and properties. They might not fully understand the commutative property or the concept of reciprocals. Therefore, they could be more likely to agree with Tom or not understand Katie's correctness, leading to:
  - A: 30% (some might mistakenly think Tom is right)
  - B: 20% (might think only Katie is right but not understand why)
  - C: 20% (some might incorrectly think both are right)
  - D: 30% (some might realize neither is correct in a general sense)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a better grasp of basic algebra. They are likely to understand Katie's statement but might still be tricked by Tom's:
  - A: 20%
  - B: 40% (understand Katie but not necessarily why Tom is wrong)
  - C: 20% (might still incorrectly think both are right)
  - D: 20%

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid understanding of algebra and should easily see that Katie is correct and Tom is not:
  - A: 10%
  - B: 60% (clearly understand Katie is right)
  - C: 10% (unlikely to think both are right)
  - D: 20%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and should not be misled:
  - A: 0% (should not think Tom is right)
  - B: 80% (clearly see Katie is right and Tom is wrong)
  - C: 0% (know both statements' validity)
  - D: 20%

## 5: Adjusting Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student misconceptions, let's refine these predictions to better reflect likely student performance:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%

The best answer is B.
