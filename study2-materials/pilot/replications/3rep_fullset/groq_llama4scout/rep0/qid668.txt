To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions.

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. In the given set of numbers: \(0, 0, 2, 2\), both \(0\) and \(2\) appear twice, which is more than any other number. Therefore, the correct answer is that both \(0\) and \(2\) are modes, which corresponds to option A.

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept of Mode
The mode is a measure of central tendency that identifies the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode at all if all values are unique.

## 2: Analyzing the Given Dataset
The dataset provided is \(0, 0, 2, 2\). Here, \(0\) and \(2\) both appear twice, making them equally frequent. This means the dataset is bimodal.

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to think that a dataset can only have one mode, or to misunderstand what constitutes a mode. However, the question here is straightforward: if two or more values appear with the same highest frequency, and that frequency is higher than any other value's frequency, then both (or all) of these values are modes.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic definitions or might not fully understand the concept of mode. They might incorrectly choose \(C\) (1) because they misunderstand what a mode is, or \(D\) (There is no mode) because they don't recognize that \(0\) and \(2\) appear equally often. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 40\%\), \(D = 30\%\).

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of statistical terms but might still make errors. They are likely to understand that mode refers to the most frequent value but might not immediately see that both \(0\) and \(2\) qualify. \(A = 60\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 10\%\).

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid understanding of the concept of mode and are likely to correctly identify both \(0\) and \(2\) as modes. \(A = 80\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the concept but are also less likely to fall into common misconceptions. They will almost certainly choose \(A\). \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 3\%\), \(D = 2\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
