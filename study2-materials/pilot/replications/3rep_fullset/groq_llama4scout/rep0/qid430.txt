## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential misconception
The question asks for the gradient of the line given by the equation \(4x - 5y = 20\). A common misconception related to the gradient of a line given in a general form \(ax + by = c\) is that students might confuse the coefficients of \(x\) and \(y\) or forget to rearrange the equation into the slope-intercept form \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the gradient.

## 2: Identify the correct method to find the gradient
To find the gradient, the equation should be rearranged into the slope-intercept form. Rearranging \(4x - 5y = 20\) gives \(-5y = -4x + 20\), and thus \(y = \frac{4}{5}x - 4\). This shows that the gradient of the line is \(\frac{4}{5}\).

## 3: Analyze the options given
The options provided are:
A: \(4\)
B: \(\frac{4}{5}\)
C: \(-\frac{4}{5}\)
D: \(-4\)

## 4: Consider the potential errors for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not know how to rearrange the equation or might confuse the signs and coefficients. They might choose A or D due to a lack of understanding of how to convert the equation into slope-intercept form.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to rearrange the equation but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose B as correct if they rearrange the equation correctly, but some might choose A if they forget to divide by -5.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily rearrange the equation and identify the gradient as \(\frac{4}{5}\), choosing B. However, some might mistakenly choose C if they incorrectly rearrange the equation or forget the sign.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only correctly identify the gradient but also be able to do so quickly and accurately, choosing B.

## 5: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (misinterpreting coefficients), B=20% (correct but unlikely due to skill level), C=10% (incorrect sign), D=30% (misinterpreting equation).
- **Basic**: A=25% (careless mistake), B=60% (correct), C=10% (mistake with signs), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (rare mistake), B=85% (correct), C=5% (small chance of mistake), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no mistakes expected), B=95% (correct), C=3% (very rare mistake), D=2% (very unlikely).

## 6: Adjust estimates based on common misconceptions and question difficulty
Given the straightforward nature of rearranging \(4x - 5y = 20\) into \(y = \frac{4}{5}x - 4\), even lower-ability students have a decent chance of getting it right if they follow procedures. The question does not particularly trigger common misconceptions strongly because the numbers are straightforward.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
