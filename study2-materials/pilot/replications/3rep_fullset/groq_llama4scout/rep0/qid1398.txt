To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the characteristics of a reciprocal function and the given graphs.

A reciprocal function, in its basic form \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), has two asymptotes: a vertical asymptote at \(x = 0\) and a horizontal asymptote at \(y = 0\). The graph consists of two branches, one in the first quadrant and one in the third quadrant. As \(x\) approaches 0 from the right, \(y\) approaches infinity. As \(x\) approaches infinity, \(y\) approaches 0.

- **Option A** does not show a graph that approaches the y-axis asymptotically nor does it have the characteristic shape of a reciprocal function; it seems to describe a curve that continually rises.
  
- **Option B** shows two branches, one in the top right quadrant and one in the bottom left quadrant, which matches the general shape of a reciprocal function. The branches approach the axes asymptotically.

- **Option C** describes a graph that crosses the origin and does not have asymptotic behavior towards the axes, which does not fit the typical shape of a reciprocal function.

- **Option D** describes a symmetrical U shape, which does not match the characteristics of a reciprocal function.

Given these descriptions:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to identify key features of functions. They might be confused by the descriptions but could lean towards simplistic or recognizable shapes.
  - A: 20% (might be misled by gradual increase)
  - B: 40% (recognizes two separate branches)
  - C: 20% (misinterprets as it has a clear turning point)
  - D: 20% (recognizes a 'U' shape but not appropriate)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might not fully recognize the asymptotic behavior.
  - A: 10% 
  - B: 60% (better understanding of asymptotic behavior)
  - C: 15% 
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient**: These students understand the properties of reciprocal functions well.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 80% 
  - C: 5%
  - D: 10%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the properties but can apply them to identify functions quickly.
  - A: 0% 
  - B: 90%
  - C: 0%
  - D: 10%

Thus, the prediction, given the exact format required, is:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
