To tackle this question, let's first understand the concepts involved and then predict how students at different ability levels might respond.

- **Variable**: A symbol that represents a value that can change.
- **Expression**: A group of numbers, symbols, and/or operators that can be evaluated to a single value. It doesn't contain an equals sign.
- **Equation**: A statement that two mathematical expressions have the same value; it contains an equals sign.
- **Term**: A single part of an expression or equation that is separated by operators (like +, -, etc.).

The given statement is \(6 - 3g = 3\). 

## Step 1: Identifying the Nature of the Statement
The statement \(6 - 3g = 3\) includes an equals sign and can be evaluated or solved for \(g\), which makes it more than just an expression or a term. It equates two expressions, making it an equation.

## 2: Evaluating Option A - Variable
A variable is a symbol that represents a value that can change. Here, \(g\) is indeed a variable, but the question asks for a word to describe the entire statement \(6 - 3g = 3\), not just part of it.

## 3: Evaluating Option B - Expression
An expression is a collection of numbers, variables, and mathematical operations. While \(6 - 3g\) is an expression, the entire statement \(6 - 3g = 3\) includes an equals sign and therefore is not just an expression.

## 4: Evaluating Option C - Equation
An equation states that two expressions are equal. The statement \(6 - 3g = 3\) fits this definition perfectly because it equates two mathematical expressions.

## 5: Evaluating Option D - Term
A term is a single part of an algebraic expression, separated by an operator. In \(6 - 3g = 3\), there are multiple terms, and the entire statement cannot be described simply as a term.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with the vocabulary and the concept of equations. They might confuse the terms or not understand the definitions well. However, they might still be able to identify that it's not just a simple number or a single term. Option C (Equation) might be challenging for them to choose correctly due to a lack of understanding of the terminology. **A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%**
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebraic concepts. They should recognize the equals sign and understand that \(6 - 3g = 3\) represents a relationship between expressions. They are more likely to choose correctly between expression and equation. **A=10%, B=20%, C=60%, D=10%**
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are comfortable with algebraic terminology and concepts. They should easily recognize \(6 - 3g = 3\) as an equation because it contains an equals sign and equates two expressions. **A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%**
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebraic concepts and terminology. They will certainly understand the distinction and choose the correct term. **A=0%, B=0%, C=100%, D=0%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
