## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to identify which multiplication will help factorise the quadratic expression \( x^{2}+13 x+30 \). To factorise this expression, students need to find two numbers that multiply to 30 and add up to 13.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Factors
The factors of 30 that add up to 13 are 3 and 10, because \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) and \( 3 + 10 = 13 \). This means the correct answer is C) \( 3 \times 10 \).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve students not checking if the numbers they choose both multiply to the constant term and add to the coefficient of the linear term. However, in this case, the question directly guides students towards considering the multiplication that leads to factorisation.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts and adding numbers. They might choose randomly or pick a multiplication that seems familiar, such as \( 1 \times 30 \) or \( 5 \times 6 \) without checking if the numbers add up to 13. However, given the straightforward nature of the question, some might still stumble upon the correct answer by chance or through trial and error. Predicted percentages: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a better grasp of multiplication and addition but might not always apply these skills accurately in algebraic contexts. They are more likely to recognize the need to find factors of 30 but might make errors in calculations or not systematic in their approach. Predicted percentages: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid understanding of algebra and factorisation. They should be able to quickly identify that \( 3 \times 10 \) are the numbers that add to 13 and multiply to 30. Predicted percentages: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the concept but can apply it quickly and accurately. They might also recognize that only one option directly corresponds to the factors needed for factorisation. Predicted percentages: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%.

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis, the predicted percentages for each ability level are as follows:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
