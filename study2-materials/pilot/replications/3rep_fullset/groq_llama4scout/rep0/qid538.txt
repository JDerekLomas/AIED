## Step 1: Understand the question and the content it tests
The question tests the ability to calculate the perimeter of a compound shape made up of a square and a regular pentagon, given the area of the square. The area of the square is \(196 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\), which implies that the side length of the square is \(\sqrt{196} = 14 \mathrm{~cm}\).

## 2: Determine the side length of the regular pentagon
Since the shape is made up of a square and a regular pentagon joined along one edge, and assuming they share a side, the side length of the pentagon is also \(14 \mathrm{~cm}\) because a regular pentagon has all sides of equal length.

## 3: Calculate the perimeter of the compound shape
The perimeter of the square is \(4 \times 14 = 56 \mathrm{~cm}\), and the perimeter of the regular pentagon is \(5 \times 14 = 70 \mathrm{~cm}\). However, when joined along one edge, two sides are internal to the compound shape and should not be counted in its perimeter. Thus, the perimeter of the compound shape is \(56 + 70 - 2 \times 14 = 56 + 70 - 28 = 98 \mathrm{~cm}\).

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions and errors
A common misconception might involve not accounting for the shared side correctly or misinterpreting how the perimeters combine. However, given that the numbers are straightforward and the concept of shared sides is clear, the main task is to ensure students correctly calculate the side lengths and apply them to find the perimeter.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic calculations or not fully understand the concept of perimeter and area. They might incorrectly calculate the side length of the square or not understand how to combine the shapes' perimeters. Option A seems too low, B seems unrelated, C seems plausible but requires correct calculation, and D seems correct but let's assess the likelihood. Given the simplicity of the numbers, \(14\%\) might choose A (incorrectly thinking the side length is the perimeter), \(10\%\) might choose B (possibly adding areas or incorrect calculation), \(20\%\) might choose C (possibly misinterpreting how perimeters add), and \(60\%\) might choose D (correct calculation).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are more likely to get it right but could be swayed by obvious incorrect answers. So, A=\(5\%\), B=\(5\%\), C=\(20\%\), D=\(70\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make simple mistakes. They would likely calculate the perimeter correctly. So, A=\(1\%\), B=\(1\%\), C=\(10\%\), D=\(88\%\).
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them to complex problems efficiently. They are very likely to get it right. So, A=\(0\%\), B=\(0\%\), C=\(5\%\), D=\(95\%\).

## 6: Convert predictions into the required format
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=\(14\%\) B=\(10\%\) C=\(20\%\) D=\(56\%\)
- **basic**: A=\(5\%\) B=\(5\%\) C=\(20\%\) D=\(70\%\)
- **proficient**: A=\(1\%\) B=\(1\%\) C=\(10\%\) D=\(88\%\)
- **advanced**: A=\(0\%\) B=\(0\%\) C=\(5\%\) D=\(95\%\)

The best answer is D.
