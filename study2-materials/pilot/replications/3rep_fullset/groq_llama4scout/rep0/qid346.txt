To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and the common misconceptions associated with ratios.

The question presents a ratio of yoghurt sharing between Kate and Isaac as \(2:5\). The task is to determine what fraction of the total yoghurt Kate has. This can be calculated by adding the parts of the ratio (\(2 + 5 = 7\)) and then finding Kate's fraction as \(\frac{2}{7}\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Ratio
The ratio \(2:5\) means that for every 2 parts Kate gets, Isaac gets 5 parts. The total parts are \(2 + 5 = 7\).

## 2: Identifying Kate's Fraction
Kate's share of the yoghurt is \(\frac{2}{7}\) of the total because her parts are 2 out of the total 7 parts.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve misunderstanding how to express a part of a ratio as a fraction of the whole. For instance, some might incorrectly calculate Kate's fraction as \(\frac{2}{5}\) (comparing her share directly to Isaac's without considering the total) or mistakenly think it involves adding or comparing the ratios in a different manner.

## 4: Evaluating the Options
- A: \(\frac{3}{2}\) is incorrect because it implies Kate has more than the whole, which doesn't make sense.
- B: \(\frac{3}{5}\) suggests a comparison that doesn't align with the ratio given or the calculation for Kate's share.
- C: \(\frac{2}{5}\) might seem plausible but actually represents Isaac's share relative to Kate's, not Kate's share of the total.
- D: \(\frac{2}{7}\) correctly represents Kate's share of the total yoghurt.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with ratios and fractions. They could mistakenly choose A, B, or C due to a lack of understanding. A=30% (misinterpreting the ratio for a larger fraction), B=20% (incorrect comparison), C=30% (Isaac's fraction), D=20%.
- **Basic:** These students have a foundational understanding but might still make errors. A=10%, B=15%, C=25%, D=50%.
- **Proficient:** Students here understand ratios and fractions well. A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80%.
- **Advanced:** These students are confident and accurate with ratios and fractions. A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95%.

Given these considerations, the predicted percentages are:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=25% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
