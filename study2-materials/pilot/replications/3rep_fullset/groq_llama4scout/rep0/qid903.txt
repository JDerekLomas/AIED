To approach this question, let's analyze the shapes presented and the concept of a line of symmetry. A line of symmetry is a line that divides a shape into two parts that are mirror images of each other.

- **Shape A (Trapezium):** A trapezium does not inherently have a line of symmetry, although some special types of trapeziums (like isosceles trapeziums) do. Without specifying that this is an isosceles trapezium, we should assume it doesn't have a line of symmetry for general understanding.

- **Shape B (Circle with a 90-degree sector removed):** A circle has multiple lines of symmetry, but removing a sector disrupts this symmetry. However, the shape B, being a circle with a sector removed, does not have a line of symmetry in the traditional sense because it's no longer a complete circle.

- **Shape C (Crescent shape):** A crescent shape, or a moon shape, does not have a line of symmetry. It's designed to be asymmetrical.

- **Option D (All of them):** For this to be true, all shapes must have at least one line of symmetry.

Given these observations:
- **Trapezium (A)** may or may not have a line of symmetry, depending on whether it's specifically an isosceles trapezium.
- **Circle with a sector removed (B)** does not have a line of symmetry.
- **Crescent shape (C)** does not have a line of symmetry.

## Step 1: Understanding Lines of Symmetry
A line of symmetry divides a shape into two identical parts. 

## 2: Analyzing Shape A
An isosceles trapezium has a line of symmetry, but a general trapezium does not.

## 3: Analyzing Shape B
Removing a sector from a circle destroys its symmetry.

## 4: Analyzing Shape C
A crescent or moon shape typically does not have a line of symmetry.

## 5: Making Predictions
- **Below Basic:** Students might struggle to understand the concept of symmetry. They might incorrectly assume all shapes could have symmetry or not understand the specific conditions for each shape. So, they might choose A (20%), B (10%), C (10%), D (60%).
- **Basic:** Students understand basic shapes but might not apply the symmetry concept accurately across all shapes. They might recognize A could have symmetry under certain conditions but not B or C. So, A (40%), B (20%), C (10%), D (30%).
- **Proficient:** Students have a good understanding of shapes and symmetry. They'd likely identify A as potentially having symmetry if it's isosceles, but not B or C. So, A (70%), B (10%), C (5%), D (15%).
- **Advanced:** These students would have a nuanced understanding and could consider the conditions under which each shape has symmetry. They'd likely choose A if they consider it could be an isosceles trapezium. So, A (90%), B (0%), C (0%), D (10%).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
