To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the method Dora uses.

Dora's method involves:
1. Adding the whole part first.
2. Adding the decimal part.
3. Adding the results of step 1 and step 2.

For \( 3.5 + 21.8 \), applying Dora's method:
- The whole part: \( 3 + 21 = 24 \)
- The decimal part: \( 0.5 + 0.8 = 1.3 \)
- Adding them together: \( 24 + 1.3 = 25.3 \)

So, the correct application of Dora's method is:
\( \begin{array}{c}
3+21=24 \\
0.5+0.8=1.3 \\
24+1.3=25.3
\end{array} \)

This matches option D.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question tests the understanding of adding decimal numbers using a specific method. The student's task is to apply Dora's method to a new problem.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A incorrectly calculates the decimal part sum as \( 0.5 + 0.8 = 0.13 \), which seems like a plausible mistake for students not confident in adding decimals.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B does not follow Dora's method correctly; it seems to add 3.5 and 21 directly and then add 0.8, which does not align with Dora's step-by-step process.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C correctly applies Dora's method for the whole and decimal parts but might be chosen by students who make calculation errors or do not complete the final step correctly.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D correctly applies Dora's method: adds the whole numbers (\( 3 + 21 = 24 \)), adds the decimals (\( 0.5 + 0.8 = 1.3 \)), and then adds those two results (\( 24 + 1.3 = 25.3 \)).

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic addition and decimal operations. They might choose A due to calculation errors or misunderstanding of decimals (A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose C due to calculation errors in the final step or misunderstanding (A=10%, B=20%, C=40%, D=30%).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the method and can apply it correctly. They are likely to choose D, with some possibly choosing C due to minor errors (A=5%, B=5%, C=20%, D=70%).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will easily apply Dora's method correctly and are less likely to make mistakes. Thus, they will mostly choose D (A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95%).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=20% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
