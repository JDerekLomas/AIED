To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question step by step.

The question involves adding two vectors:
\[ \left(\begin{array}{l}2 \\ 3\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}-1 \\ 0\end{array}\right) \]

To add these vectors, we add their corresponding components:
\[ \left(\begin{array}{l}2 + (-1) \\ 3 + 0\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \]

So, the correct answer is \( \left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \), which corresponds to option A.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question is designed to test the understanding of vector addition. A common misconception could be not understanding how to add vectors component-wise or making errors in simple arithmetic.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \( \left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \), is the correct answer. Students who understand vector addition should select this option.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( \left(\begin{array}{c}-2 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \), would be incorrect because it suggests \(2 + (-1) = -2\), which is an arithmetic error.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \left(\begin{array}{c}-2 \\ 0\end{array}\right) \), would also be incorrect because it suggests both \(2 + (-1) = -2\) and \(3 + 0 = 0\), combining two errors.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( \left(\begin{array}{l}3 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \), is incorrect because it suggests \(2 + (-1) = 3\), which is an arithmetic error.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of vector addition. They might be more likely to choose options with errors that reflect common misconceptions. Option B and D might seem plausible to them due to arithmetic mistakes. So, \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 30\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 30\%\).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple arithmetic errors. They are more likely to choose A but might still be tempted by B or D due to careless mistakes. So, \(A = 60\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Proficient:** These students understand vector addition and are less likely to make arithmetic errors. They should mostly choose A. So, \(A = 85\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 3\%\), \(D = 2\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of the concepts and are unlikely to make errors. They should almost exclusively choose A. So, \(A = 95\%\), \(B = 3\%\), \(C = 1\%\), \(D = 1\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
