To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with congruent shapes.

## Step 1: Understanding Congruent Shapes
Congruent shapes are those that have the same size and shape. This means that for two shapes to be congruent, their corresponding sides and angles must be equal. The orientation of the shapes does not affect their congruence.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom says that two shapes that are the same shape and size but have different orientations are congruent. This statement is correct because congruence is defined by having the same size and shape, regardless of orientation.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie says that two shapes, one big and one small, are congruent. This statement is incorrect because for shapes to be congruent, they must be of the same size and shape.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with understanding what makes shapes congruent. They might not fully grasp that orientation doesn't matter but could mistakenly think size does. Therefore, they might incorrectly choose B (Only Katie) or C (Both Tom and Katie) because they don't fully understand the concept of congruence.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of shapes but might still be confused about what constitutes congruence. They are likely to recognize that Tom's statement is correct but might be unsure or mistaken about Katie's. Hence, they could choose A (Only Tom) or D (Neither is correct) with a possibility of some choosing B or C due to misunderstanding.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand that congruent shapes must have the same size and shape, regardless of orientation. They should correctly identify Tom's statement as correct and Katie's as incorrect, leading them to choose A (Only Tom).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the definition of congruence but can also apply it accurately in various contexts. They will definitely choose A (Only Tom) as they can easily see that Tom's shapes are congruent due to being the same size and shape despite different orientations, and Katie's shapes are not congruent because they are of different sizes.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (some understand Tom but not Katie), B=30% (think Katie's is correct), C=20% (think both are correct), D=10% (recognize neither is correct).
- **Basic:** A=60% (understand Tom), B=20% (mistakenly think Katie), C=10% (believe both), D=10% (see neither).
- **Proficient:** A=80% (correctly identify Tom), B=10% (error on Katie), C=5% (both), D=5% (neither).
- **Advanced:** A=95% (accurately choose Tom), B=3% (rare error), C=1% (very rare error), D=1% (very rare error).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
