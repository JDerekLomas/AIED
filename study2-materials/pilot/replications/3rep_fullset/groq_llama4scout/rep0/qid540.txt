To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's first analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it may pose.

The question asks students to estimate the value of \(\frac{3.24 \times 17.6}{0.224}\). To solve this, let's simplify it:

\(\frac{3.24 \times 17.6}{0.224}\)

First, notice that \(0.224 = 0.224 \times 100 = 22.4 / 100\), but more usefully, \(3.24 \times 17.6\) can be computed directly.

\(3.24 \times 17.6 = 57.024\)

Then,

\(\frac{57.024}{0.224} = 254.57...\)

Or more approximately, \(255\), which is close to \(270\) but actually closer to \(250-260\). Let's approximate and see which answer it is closest to:

- \(10.8\) seems too low.
- \(12\) seems too low.
- \(270\) seems close, given \(254.57...\approx 250-260\), and considering we're estimating.
- \(300\) seems a bit high.

Given this calculation, the correct estimate, without doing the full calculation, would seem to be around \(270\), making option C the closest.

The common misconception here could involve difficulties with dividing by decimals or estimating large numbers. Students might struggle with converting decimals to more manageable forms or could make estimation errors.

Let's break down by ability level:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with the calculation and estimation. They might not even attempt to calculate \(3.24 \times 17.6\) properly or could get confused with the division by \(0.224\). Given the options, they might lean towards very rough estimates or get completely lost. 
  - A: \(30\%\) (random guessing)
  - B: \(20\%\) (random guessing)
  - C: \(30\%\) ( might seem plausible for those who can do a very rough estimate)
  - D: \(20\%\) (could seem high but plausible for very rough estimation)

- **Basic**: Students here might manage to do the multiplication but could struggle with the division by a decimal. They might incorrectly move decimals or not know how to handle \(0.224\).
  - A: \(10\%\)
  - B: \(10\%\)
  - C: \(60\%\) (as it seems the closest after a rough calculation)
  - D: \(20\%\)

- **Proficient**: These students should be able to handle decimal operations fairly well. They might do a quick estimation and recognize \(270\) as a reasonable answer.
  - A: \(5\%\)
  - B: \(5\%\)
  - C: \(80\%\)
  - D: \(10\%\)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level should easily compute or estimate the value accurately. They'd likely identify \(270\) as the closest option quickly and confidently.
  - A: \(0\%\)
  - B: \(0\%\)
  - C: \(90\%\)
  - D: \(10\%\)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
