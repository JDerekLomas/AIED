## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question presents a rectangle $ABCD$ with coordinates $A(1,3)$, $B(1,5)$, $C(2,5)$, and $D(2,3)$, which is rotated $90^{\circ}$ clockwise from the center $(3,2)$. The task is to identify the error made by John in rotating the rectangle.

## 2: Identifying the correct rotation
To rotate a point $(x, y)$ by $90^{\circ}$ clockwise around a center $(h, k)$, we use the formula $(x', y') = (h + (y - k), k - (x - h))$. Applying this to the center $(3, 2)$:
- For $A(1,3)$, $A' = (3 + (3 - 2), 2 - (1 - 3)) = (3 + 1, 2 + 2) = (4, 4)$
- For $B(1,5)$, $B' = (3 + (5 - 2), 2 - (1 - 3)) = (3 + 3, 2 + 2) = (6, 4)$
- For $C(2,5)$, $C' = (3 + (5 - 2), 2 - (2 - 3)) = (3 + 3, 2 + 1) = (6, 3)$
- For $D(2,3)$, $D' = (3 + (3 - 2), 2 - (2 - 3)) = (3 + 1, 2 + 1) = (4, 3)$

## 3: Comparing with the given solution
The rotated rectangle given has coordinates $(4,3)$, $(6,3)$, $(6,2)$, and $(4,2)$. Let's verify if this matches a $90^{\circ}$ clockwise rotation around $(3,2)$:
- The correct rotation for $A(1,3)$ around $(3,2)$ should be $(4,4)$ as calculated, not $(4,3)$.
- This indicates an error, but we need to identify the type of error.

## 4: Analyzing possible errors
- Option A: He hasn't, this is correct. This seems incorrect based on calculations.
- Option B: He has translated by the vector $\left(\begin{array}{l}3 \\ 2\end{array}\right)$. This doesn't match the transformation described.
- Option C: He has rotated $90^{\circ}$ anticlockwise. Rotating $90^{\circ}$ anticlockwise around $(3,2)$ would give different coordinates.
- Option D: He has used the wrong centre. This could be a possibility if the rotation seems correct but for a different center.

## 5: Detailed analysis for each option
- The given transformation results in points $(4,3)$, $(6,3)$, $(6,2)$, and $(4,2)$. 
- A $90^{\circ}$ clockwise rotation about $(3,2)$ should yield $(4,4)$, $(6,4)$, $(6,3)$, $(4,3)$ for $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ respectively, indicating John's rotation does not match this.

## 6: Evaluating student responses
## below_basic:
Students at this level might struggle with understanding rotations and translations. They might not accurately apply the rotation formula or understand the concept of rotating around a point not the origin.

## below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
## basic: A=10% B=25% C=25% D=40%
## proficient: A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%
## advanced: A=0% B=5% C=5% D=90%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=25% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=5% D=90%
