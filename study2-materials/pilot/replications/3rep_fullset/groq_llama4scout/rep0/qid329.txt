To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question revolves around the order of operations, specifically the correct interpretation of expressions involving division and subtraction. The correct order of operations is often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction).

## Step 1: Understand the Expressions
Tom's expression is \( 0.1 - 0.2 \div 0.3 \), which, following BIDMAS, is calculated as \( 0.1 - (0.2 \div 0.3) \). Katie's expression \( 0.2 \div 0.3 - 0.1 \) is presented as equivalent to Tom's but with the operations reversed.

## 2: Evaluate Tom's Statement
Tom says \( 0.1 - 0.2 \div 0.3 \equiv 0.1 - (0.2 \div 0.3) \). This is correct according to BIDMAS because division comes before subtraction.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's Statement
Katie says \( 0.1 - 0.2 \div 0.3 \equiv 0.2 \div 0.3 - 0.1 \). This statement is incorrect because it reverses the order of operations and the numbers' positions in a way that does not follow BIDMAS.

## 4: Calculate the Expressions for Clarity
Let's calculate \( 0.2 \div 0.3 \) to understand the values: \( 0.2 \div 0.3 \approx 0.6667 \).
- Tom's expression: \( 0.1 - 0.6667 = -0.5667 \)
- Katie's expression: \( 0.6667 - 0.1 = 0.5667 \)
These are clearly not equal, confirming Katie is incorrect.

## 5: Assess Student Understanding
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not fully understand BIDMAS or may struggle with the concept of order of operations. They might incorrectly think Katie is right (20-30%), think Tom is right but not understand why (30-40%), or not understand the question at all (20-40%). So, a plausible guess could be: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of BIDMAS but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to understand Tom's statement is correct but might be confused by Katie's. A possible distribution: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand BIDMAS well and can apply it. They should see Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect. So, A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand BIDMAS but can also see through misconceptions easily. They will definitely choose D (Katie's statement is wrong, and Tom's is correct but the question asks who is correct, implying both cannot be right). A likely distribution: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%.

## 6: Final Predictions
Given the understanding and likely student responses:
- below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
- basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
- proficient: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
- advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
