## Step 1: Understand the sequence and its pattern
The given sequence is 98, 92, 86, .... To find the pattern, let's calculate the difference between consecutive terms. The difference between the second and first term is 92 - 98 = -6, and the difference between the third and second term is 86 - 92 = -6. This indicates that the sequence decreases by 6 each time.

## 2: Determine the formula for the nth term
The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is \(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\), where \(a_1\) is the first term and \(d\) is the common difference. For this sequence, \(a_1 = 98\) and \(d = -6\). Substituting these values into the formula gives \(a_n = 98 + (n - 1)(-6)\).

## 3: Simplify the formula
Simplifying the formula: \(a_n = 98 + (n - 1)(-6) = 98 - 6n + 6 = 104 - 6n\). This can also be written as \(a_n = -6n + 104\).

## 4: Compare the simplified formula with the given options
Comparing \(a_n = -6n + 104\) with the options provided:
- A: \(-6n + 104\) matches exactly.
- B: \(-6n + 92\) is close but incorrect because it doesn't account for the initial term correctly.
- C: \(-6n\) is incorrect because it doesn't account for the starting value of the sequence.
- D: \(6n + 92\) is incorrect because it suggests the sequence increases, which is opposite to the given sequence.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with identifying the pattern or applying the formula. They might choose C because it directly relates to the common difference but forgets the starting point, or they might incorrectly choose D if they mistakenly think the sequence increases.
- **Basic:** Students here should be able to identify the sequence's pattern but might make calculation errors. They are likely to choose A if they correctly calculate the formula, but some might choose B if they miscalculate or misunderstand the sequence's starting point.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily identify the pattern and calculate the correct formula. Most should choose A, with a few potentially choosing B due to minor calculation errors.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only easily identify the pattern but also quickly derive the correct formula. They are likely to choose A, with very few choosing other options due to oversight or calculation mistakes.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each ability level
Given the simplicity of the question once the pattern is recognized, and assuming most students can identify the arithmetic sequence and its common difference:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (those who guess or partially understand), B=15% (incorrect but related), C=30% (common difference without starting point), D=35% (wrong direction or completely off).
- **Basic:** A=60% (correct calculation), B=20% (small error in calculation or sequence understanding), C=10% (overlooks initial term), D=10% (incorrectly assumes increasing sequence).
- **Proficient:** A=80% (accurately derive formula), B=10% (minor error), C=5% (fails to account for initial term), D=5% (misinterprets sequence direction).
- **Advanced:** A=90% (correctly and quickly derive), B=5% (minor miscalculation), C=2.5% (overlooks initial term), D=2.5% (misinterprets sequence).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=2.5% D=2.5%
