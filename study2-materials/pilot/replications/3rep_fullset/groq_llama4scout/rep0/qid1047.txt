## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks for the gradient of a line that passes through the points (0,0) and (1,2). The gradient of a line is calculated as the change in y divided by the change in x.

## 2: Calculate the gradient
Using the two points given, the gradient = (2 - 0) / (1 - 0) = 2 / 1 = 2.

## 3: Analyze the options
- A: \( 0 \) - This would be incorrect because it suggests the line is horizontal.
- B: \( 2 x \) - This option suggests a relationship that changes with x, which is not how gradient is defined for a straight line.
- C: \( 2 \) - This matches the calculation of the gradient.
- D: \( 1 \) - This is incorrect as it does not match the calculated gradient.

## 4: Consider student misconceptions and errors
Students might confuse the gradient with other concepts, such as the y-intercept, or might not fully understand that the gradient of a straight line is constant. Option B, \( 2 x \), could appeal to students who mistakenly think the gradient changes with x, a common misconception when not fully grasping the concept of a linear equation's slope.

## 5: Assess the difficulty and predict student responses
- Below_basic: Students at this level might not understand what gradient means or how to calculate it. They might choose A (0) because they think the line is flat, or they might choose B because it looks like a formula. C=20% (correct calculation), A=30% (thinking it's a horizontal line), B=40% (misunderstanding), D=10%.
- Basic: Students here should have a basic understanding of gradient but might still make errors. They are likely to choose C (2) as they can calculate it, but some might still be confused. C=60%, A=20%, B=15%, D=5%.
- Proficient: Students at this level should easily calculate the gradient and understand it's constant for a straight line. C=80%, A=5%, B=10%, D=5%.
- Advanced: These students not only understand how to calculate the gradient but also know it's a fundamental property of linear equations. They are very unlikely to make mistakes. C=95%, A=2%, B=2%, D=1%.

## 6: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
