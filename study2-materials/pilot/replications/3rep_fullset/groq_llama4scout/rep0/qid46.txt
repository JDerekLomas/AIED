To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions it targets.

The question presents two bar models and asks students to determine who, between Tom and Katie, is correct in their representation of \(2x\). Tom's model shows a bar divided into two parts, labeled \(2\) and \(x\), suggesting the model represents \(2 + x\), not \(2x\). Katie's model shows a bar divided into two equal parts, both labeled \(x\), which correctly represents \(x + x = 2x\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The key misconception here is understanding that \(2x\) means \(2 \times x\), not \(2 + x\). This is a fundamental concept in algebra that students often struggle with.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Representation
Tom's representation, \(\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline 2 & x \\ \hline \end{tabular}\), implies \(2 + x\), not \(2x\), making Tom incorrect.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Representation
Katie's representation, \(\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline x & x \\ \hline \end{tabular}\), correctly implies \(x + x = 2x\), making Katie correct.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic concepts. They might incorrectly interpret both models or understand neither correctly. Given the simplicity of the question and the visual aid, a significant portion might still recognize Katie's model as correct but could be confused by Tom's. Expect a high percentage to choose B (Only Katie) due to the visual clarity of Katie's model representing \(2x\), but some might mistakenly choose A (Only Tom) or D (Neither is correct) due to confusion. C (Both Tom and Katie) seems unlikely as the correct interpretation of both is distinct.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebraic expressions. They should recognize Katie's model as \(2x\) but might still be confused by Tom's model. A significant portion will choose B (Only Katie), with some potentially choosing D (Neither is correct) if they're unsure about Tom's model.

- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand algebraic expressions well. They should easily recognize Katie's model as representing \(2x\) and understand that Tom's does not. Thus, they will likely choose B (Only Katie).

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the algebraic concept but can also analyze and critique representations. They will clearly see that Katie's model represents \(2x\) and Tom's does not, leading them to choose B (Only Katie) with high confidence.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might mistakenly agree with Tom), B=60% (recognize Katie's correctness), C=10% (unlikely to think both are correct), D=10% (might think neither is correct due to confusion).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=2%, B=95%, C=2%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
