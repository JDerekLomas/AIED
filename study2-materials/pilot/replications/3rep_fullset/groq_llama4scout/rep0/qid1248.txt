## Step 1: Analyzing the question
The question presents a composite shape made from two rectangles, forming a backwards "L" shape. The dimensions given are: the base of the shape is 11cm long, the vertical height of the whole shape is 12cm, the horizontal width of the top part of the shape is 5cm, and the vertical height of the bottom rectangle is 4cm. The top rectangle is shaded.

## 2: Identifying the relevant dimensions for the shaded area
To find the area of the shaded section, we need to determine the dimensions of the shaded rectangle. The height of the shaded rectangle is the same as the total height minus the height of the bottom rectangle, which is 12cm - 4cm = 8cm. The width of the shaded rectangle is given as 5cm.

## 3: Calculating the area of the shaded section
The area of a rectangle is calculated as width times height. So, the area of the shaded section is 5cm * 8cm = 40cm^2.

## 4: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with calculating areas or identifying the correct dimensions. They might incorrectly calculate the area or choose an answer without calculation. Given the straightforward nature of the calculation once the correct dimensions are identified, but considering potential miscalculations or incorrect identification of dimensions, we might expect a spread across the options but with a significant portion possibly choosing A if they correctly identify the dimensions but make calculation errors.

- **Basic**: Students here should be able to follow the calculation but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are likely to calculate the area correctly but could be misled by the layout or forget to calculate the dimensions correctly.

- **Proficient**: These students should easily identify the correct dimensions and calculate the area without issues. They are less likely to make mistakes in identifying the dimensions or in the arithmetic.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only calculate the area correctly but also be able to handle more complex aspects of the question. They are highly likely to choose the correct answer.

## 5: Estimating the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the correct calculation is 40cm^2:
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (as they might guess or make simple errors), B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: A=80% (correct calculation), B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=95% (correct), B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=99% (correct), B=0.5%, C=0.3%, D=0.2%.

The best answer is A.
