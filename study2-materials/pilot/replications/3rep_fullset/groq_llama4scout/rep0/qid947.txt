To solve this, let's first analyze the conjecture and the examples given by Tom and Katie.

The conjecture states that all numbers have an even number of factors because factors come in pairs. This is generally true, but there are exceptions. A number has an odd number of factors if and only if it is a perfect square. This is because, in the list of factors, each factor pairs up with another, except when the number is a perfect square; in that case, the square root of the number is a factor that does not have a separate pair.

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Counterexample
Tom says \(24\) is a counter-example. To verify, we list the factors of \(24\): \(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\). There are \(8\) factors, which is an even number. Therefore, \(24\) does not serve as a counter-example to the conjecture that all numbers have an even number of factors.

## 2: Analyze Katie's Counterexample
Katie says \(16\) is a counter-example. Listing the factors of \(16\): \(1, 2, 4, 8, 16\). There are \(5\) factors, which is an odd number. Since \(16\) is a perfect square (\(4^2\)), it indeed has an odd number of factors, making it a counter-example to the conjecture.

## 3: Determine the Correct Answer
Given that \(24\) is not a counter-example but \(16\) is, Katie is correct, and Tom is not. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Only Katie.

## 4: Predict Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of factors or the conditions under which a number has an odd or even number of factors. They might incorrectly identify counterexamples or not understand why a specific number is or isn't a counterexample. Given the nature of the question, a significant portion might choose A or D due to confusion. \(A=30\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=40\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of factors but might struggle with applying the concept to counterexamples. They might recognize \(16\) as a perfect square and thus a counter-example but could be unsure about \(24\). \(A=15\%\), \(B=40\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=35\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand factors and perfect squares. They should recognize \(16\) as a counter-example and understand \(24\) is not. \(A=5\%\), \(B=60\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=30\%\).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concepts but can also reason about the properties of numbers and their factors efficiently. They will easily identify \(16\) as a counter-example and dismiss \(24\). \(A=2\%\), \(B=80\%\), \(C=2\%\), \(D=16\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=2% B=80% C=2% D=16%
