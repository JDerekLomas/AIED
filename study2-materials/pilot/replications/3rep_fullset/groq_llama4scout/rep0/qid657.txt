To tackle this question, let's consider what it tests: the ability to compare integers. This seems straightforward but might catch students who have a misconception about how numbers are structured or compared, especially if they're not paying close attention to the digits and their places.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The potential misconception here involves misunderstanding the place value of digits in a number. For instance, some students might mistakenly think that because 5 is greater than 4, then 5000 would be greater than any number starting with 4, which is correct but let's see if they apply it correctly. Katie's statement compares 3050 to 3500, which could potentially confuse students if they look at the hundreds place without considering the thousands.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom says \( 5000 \) is greater than \( 4987 \). This statement is clearly true because 5000 is indeed greater than 4987. A student with a basic understanding of number comparison should get this right.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie says \( 3050 \) is greater than \( 3500 \). This statement is false because 3050 is less than 3500. The error here could arise from students not properly comparing the numbers, possibly getting distracted by the lower place values (0 vs. 0) without noticing the thousands and hundreds place values.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic number comparisons. They might incorrectly think Katie is right or not understand how to compare the numbers properly. So, they might choose B (Only Katie) or D (Neither is correct) because they don't accurately compare the numbers. Prediction: A=40% (gets Tom right but might not understand Katie's mistake), B=20% (thinks only Katie is right, which is incorrect), C=10% (unlikely to understand both correctly), D=30% (doesn't understand either).
- **Basic**: Students here should understand basic comparisons. They are likely to get Tom's statement right but might struggle with Katie's if they're not careful. Prediction: A=70% (recognizes Tom's correctness), B=10% (recognizes Katie's error), C=5% (unlikely both are recognized correctly in this group), D=15% (some might still be unsure).
- **Proficient**: These students should easily recognize Tom's statement as true and Katie's as false. Prediction: A=80% (easily see Tom is correct), B=5% (unlikely to think Katie is the only one correct), C=5% (both correct is not possible here), D=10% (a few might still misunderstand).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level would definitely understand the comparisons. Prediction: A=90% (clearly Tom is correct), B=0% (Katie's statement is incorrect), C=0% (both can't be correct), D=10% (very few, if any, would think neither is correct).

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the above analysis, here are the predictions in the required format:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
