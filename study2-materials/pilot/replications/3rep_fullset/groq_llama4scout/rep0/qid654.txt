To approach this question, let's first analyze the algebraic expression given and what it would take to simplify it, then consider the common misconceptions and errors students might make.

The expression to simplify is \( \frac{m^{2}-2 m-3}{m-3} \). This can be simplified by factoring the numerator. The numerator \( m^{2} - 2m - 3 \) can be factored as \( (m - 3)(m + 1) \), because -3 times 1 equals -3, and -3 plus 1 equals -2, which matches the coefficient of \( m \).

So, \( \frac{m^{2}-2 m-3}{m-3} = \frac{(m - 3)(m + 1)}{m - 3} \).

For \( m \neq 3 \), this simplifies to \( m + 1 \), because \( (m - 3) \) cancels out.

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Simplification
The correct simplification of the given expression is \( m + 1 \), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Consider Common Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not fully factoring the numerator or incorrectly cancelling terms. However, the expression is designed in such a way that if a student recognizes the factorable form of the numerator, they can easily simplify it.

## 3: Analyze the Difficulty Level
The question requires the student to factor a quadratic expression and then simplify a fraction. This is a standard algebraic technique but might catch students who are not fluent in factoring or who do not check for cancellation of common factors.

## 4: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with factoring the quadratic or understanding the cancellation process. They might choose \( m - 2 \) (B) or \( m - 1 \) (C) if they attempt to simplify without proper factoring or misinterpret the factors. \( m + 1 \) (A) seems unlikely for many, but \( D \) (Does not simplify) could also be a choice if they recognize that \( m = 3 \) would make the denominator zero but don't see the factorization. Let's predict: A=20% (guessing), B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.

- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of basic algebra. They might still make simple mistakes but are more likely to attempt factoring. Let's predict: A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.

- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations. They should easily factor and simplify. Let's predict: A=85%, B=5%, C=5%, D=5%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very confident in their algebraic skills. Almost all should get it right. Let's predict: A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.

The best answer is below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
