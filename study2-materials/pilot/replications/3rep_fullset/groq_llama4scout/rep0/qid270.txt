To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given inequality \(x^{2} < 16\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The inequality \(x^{2} < 16\) can be solved by taking the square root of both sides, remembering to consider both the positive and negative square roots due to the nature of \(x^2\). This yields \(-4 < x < 4\), which corresponds to option B: \(\{-4<x<4\}\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception is to consider only the positive square root, leading to \(x < 4\), which is option C. Another error could be misunderstanding the direction of the inequality or not fully squaring the inequality correctly.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A: \(\{x<-4\} \cup\{x>4\}\) suggests that \(x^2 > 16\), which is the opposite of what we're solving for. This would likely be chosen by students who misunderstand the inequality sign or the squaring process.

## 3: Analyzing Option D
Option D: \(\{-8<x<8\}\) suggests a different inequality, \(x^2 < 64\), not \(x^2 < 16\). This could be chosen by students who mistakenly use a different number or incorrectly solve the inequality.

## 4: Ability Levels and Predictions
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and understanding of inequalities. They might incorrectly choose options that reflect a lack of understanding of squaring and inequalities, such as A or D, due to confusion.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make simple errors. They might choose C because they forget to consider the negative root.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts but might still make occasional errors under pressure. They are likely to choose B but might occasionally choose C if they rush.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make errors.

## 5: Predictions
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (misunderstanding of inequality), B=20% (correct but struggling), C=30% (only positive root), D=20% (random/guess).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=60%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=95%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
