To approach this question, let's consider the properties of the quadrilaterals mentioned and the concept of rotational symmetry.

- A trapezium (or trapezoid) has no rotational symmetry in the general case, except for the isosceles trapezium, which still only has a rotational symmetry of order 1 (or no rotational symmetry).
- An irregular quadrilateral generally has no rotational symmetry.
- A parallelogram has rotational symmetry of order 2 if it's not a rectangle or a rhombus, but if it's a rectangle or a rhombus, it can have higher order symmetry (up to order 4 for a square).
- Rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a figure can be rotated by a certain angle (less than 360 degrees) and still look the same.

Given these definitions:

## Step 1: Understanding Rotational Symmetry
The order of rotational symmetry refers to how many times a shape can be rotated within 360 degrees and still appear the same. A shape with rotational symmetry of order 2 looks the same after a 180-degree rotation.

## 2: Applying to Given Shapes
- A trapezium typically does not have rotational symmetry (order 1).
- An irregular quadrilateral generally does not have rotational symmetry (order 1).
- A parallelogram, if it's a general parallelogram, has an order of rotational symmetry of 2 (since it looks the same after a 180-degree rotation).

## 3: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand what rotational symmetry means. They might incorrectly assume all shapes have the same or no symmetry, or they might pick based on the appearance without understanding symmetry. 
  - A=30% (guessing or mistaken identity)
  - B=30% (similar reasoning)
  - C=20% (recognizing parallelogram's symmetry)
  - D=20% (not understanding or thinking they are equal)

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic grasp of shapes but might confuse properties. They might know a parallelogram has some symmetry.
  - A=20% 
  - B=20% 
  - C=40% (recognizing parallelogram can have order 2 symmetry)
  - D=20% 

- **Proficient:** These students understand the properties of quadrilaterals and symmetry. They should recognize a parallelogram has order 2 symmetry, and others generally have order 1.
  - A=10% 
  - B=10% 
  - C=60% 
  - D=20% 

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand but can apply and reason about the properties. They'd definitely know a parallelogram has order 2 symmetry.
  - A=5% 
  - B=5% 
  - C=80% 
  - D=10% 

The best answer is C. 

Predictions:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
