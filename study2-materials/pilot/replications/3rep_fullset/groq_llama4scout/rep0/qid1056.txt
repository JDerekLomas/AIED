## Step 1: Understand the sequence given
The sequence provided is 11, 15, 19, 23, ... which indicates a common difference of 4 between each term.

## 2: Identify the general formula for the nth term
Given the sequence starts at 11 and increases by 4 each time, the nth term can be represented as \(11 + (n-1) \times 4\), which simplifies to \(11 + 4n - 4\) or \(7 + 4n\).

## 3: Solve for n when the term is 67
To find the position in the sequence where the number 67 appears, we set the nth term formula equal to 67 and solve for n: \(7 + 4n = 67\).

## 4: Perform the algebra to solve for n
Subtract 7 from both sides: \(4n = 60\).
Divide both sides by 4: \(n = 15\).

## 5: Evaluate the answer choices based on the solution
- A: \(16.75\) suggests a misunderstanding of how sequences work or a miscalculation.
- B: \(275\) seems unrelated to the straightforward calculation of n.
- C: \(4n + 7\) is actually the correct formula for the nth term, not the position of 67.
- D: \(15\) matches our calculation for the position of 67 in the sequence.

## 6: Consider student misconceptions and errors
Students might struggle with:
- Not recognizing the sequence's pattern or not applying it correctly.
- Confusing the formula for the nth term with finding a specific term's position.
- Making calculation errors.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **below_basic**: Might not understand sequences well, could guess or miscalculate. A=40% (incorrect but plausible if they try to solve it), B=20% (random guess), C=10% (might recognize the formula but not apply it), D=30% (correct calculation).
- **basic**: Understands basic sequences, might make calculation errors. A=30%, B=15%, C=15%, D=40%.
- **proficient**: Should easily solve it but might get distracted. A=15%, B=5%, C=10%, D=70%.
- **advanced**: Should have no issues with this. A=5%, B=0%, C=5%, D=90%.

## 8: Adjust predictions for realistic error rates
Given the straightforward nature of this question once the pattern is recognized, most students should be able to get it right, especially if they've covered sequences.

## 9: Final predictions
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
- **basic**: A=25% B=10% C=10% D=55%
- **proficient**: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=10% C=10% D=55%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
