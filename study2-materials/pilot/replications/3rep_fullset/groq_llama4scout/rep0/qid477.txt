To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The expansion of the expression \((x+4)(x-1)\) requires the use of the distributive property (or FOIL method), which is a fundamental concept in algebra. The correct expansion is:

\[
(x+4)(x-1) = x(x) + x(-1) + 4(x) + 4(-1)
\]

\[
= x^2 - x + 4x - 4
\]

\[
= x^2 + 3x - 4
\]

Let's compare this to the given options:

A: \(x^{2}-x+4x+3 = x^2 + 3x + 3\)

B: \(x^{2}+x+4x-3 = x^2 + 5x - 3\)

C: \(x^{2}-x-4x+4 = x^2 - 5x + 4\)

D: \(x^{2}-x+4x-4 = x^2 + 3x - 4\)

The correct answer is D.

Now, let's consider how students at different ability levels might perform:

### below_basic
Students at this level struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not fully understand how to apply the FOIL method or make simple arithmetic errors.

- A: 30% (confusing signs and not applying FOIL correctly)
- B: 20% (adding instead of subtracting and misapplying terms)
- C: 25% (incorrectly handling negative signs and constants)
- D: 25% (either gets it correct by chance or partially understands FOIL)

### basic
Basic level students have a grasp of the FOIL method but might make careless mistakes or not fully simplify their answers.

- A: 20% (misunderstanding the application of signs)
- B: 15% (making errors in combining like terms)
- C: 20% (incorrect handling of negative terms)
- D: 45% (understands FOIL, applies it correctly)

### proficient
Proficient students are comfortable with algebraic expansions and should be able to apply the FOIL method accurately.

- A: 5% (small chance of minor error)
- B: 5% (error in signs or combining terms)
- C: 10% (misunderstanding of negative signs)
- D: 80% (accurately applies FOIL and simplifies)

### advanced
Advanced students have a deep understanding of algebra and should find this question straightforward.

- A: 0% (unlikely to make such a basic error)
- B: 0% (similarly unlikely)
- C: 5% (possibility of testing a misconception but low)
- D: 95% (comfortably and accurately expands the expression)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=20% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
