To approach this, let's analyze the question and the potential difficulties students might face based on their ability levels.

The question involves solving a simple linear equation and evaluating the correctness of two proposed steps in the solution process. The equation given is:
\[
\frac{x-6}{2}=10
\]

To solve it, one would typically multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator, leading to:
\[
x - 6 = 20
\]
Then, add 6 to both sides to solve for \(x\):
\[
x = 26
\]

Now, let's evaluate Tom's and Katie's suggestions:

1. **Tom's suggestion:** \( \frac{x}{2}=16 \)
If we multiply both sides of the original equation by 2, we get:
\[
x - 6 = 20
\]
Adding 6 to both sides gives:
\[
x = 26
\]
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
\[
\frac{x}{2} = 13
\]
So, Tom is incorrect.

2. **Katie's suggestion:** \( x-6=20 \)
Multiplying both sides of the original equation by 2 directly gives:
\[
x - 6 = 20
\]
So, Katie is correct in her suggestion as a next step but let's see how it aligns with common misconceptions and student understanding.

## Predicting Student Responses

### below_basic:
At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly solve the equation or understand the steps involved.
- **A (Only Tom):** 20% (Some might mistakenly think Tom's step is correct without properly checking.)
- **B (Only Katie):** 40% (Katie's step seems more directly related to solving the equation, which might appeal to students who understand the basic operation of multiplying both sides by 2.)
- **C (Both Tom and Katie):** 10% (Students at this level might not carefully evaluate each step.)
- **D (Neither is correct):** 30% (Some students might recognize that Tom's step is incorrect but not fully understand Katie's.)

### basic:
Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra but might make simple mistakes.
- **A (Only Tom):** 15% (Students might see Tom's manipulation as plausible but incorrect upon closer inspection.)
- **B (Only Katie):** 60% (Katie's suggestion directly follows from a standard algebraic manipulation.)
- **C (Both Tom and Katie):** 5% (Students here are more likely to accurately assess each suggestion.)
- **D (Neither is correct):** 20% (Some might recognize both are incorrect or not fully understand.)

### proficient:
Students here have a solid grasp of algebraic methods and are less likely to be misled.
- **A (Only Tom):** 5%
- **B (Only Katie):** 80%
- **C (Both Tom and Katie):** 5%
- **D (Neither is correct):** 10%

### advanced:
At this level, students not only understand algebra well but can also critically evaluate mathematical statements.
- **A (Only Tom):** 0% (Tom's suggestion is clearly incorrect.)
- **B (Only Katie):** 90%
- **C (Both Tom and Katie):** 0%
- **D (Neither is correct):** 10%

Given the above analysis:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
