## Step 1: Analyze the sequence given to understand the pattern.
The sequence provided is \(94, 86, 78, \ldots\). To find the pattern, let's calculate the difference between consecutive terms. From 94 to 86, the difference is \(86 - 94 = -8\). From 86 to 78, the difference is \(78 - 86 = -8\). This indicates that each term decreases by 8.

## 2: Determine the general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.
The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is \(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\), where \(a_n\) is the nth term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(n\) is the term number, and \(d\) is the common difference.

## 3: Apply the general formula to the given sequence.
For this sequence, \(a_1 = 94\) and \(d = -8\). Substituting these values into the general formula gives \(a_n = 94 + (n - 1)(-8)\).

## 4: Simplify the formula.
Simplifying, we get \(a_n = 94 - 8n + 8 = 102 - 8n\).

## 5: Compare the simplified formula with the given options.
The simplified formula \(a_n = 102 - 8n\) can also be written as \(a_n = -8n + 102\). Let's compare this with the options:
- A: \(8n + 86\)
- B: \(-8n + 106\)
- C: \(-8n\)
- D: \(-8n + 102\)

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with identifying the pattern or applying the formula. They might incorrectly identify the sequence or forget to apply the formula correctly. Option C seems too simple and might appeal to those not fully understanding the sequence. Option A is clearly incorrect due to the positive slope. Option B is close but incorrect. Option D matches our derivation. Given the struggle with basics, A=20%, B=15%, C=30%, D=35%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of sequences but might make calculation errors. They are more likely to recognize the sequence type but could mess up the formula. A=10%, B=20%, C=15%, D=55%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand sequences well and can apply the formula accurately. They are less likely to make errors in calculation. A=5%, B=10%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can also manipulate and apply formulas with ease. They are highly unlikely to make errors. A=0%, B=5%, C=0%, D=95%.

## 7: Convert predictions into the required format.
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
- basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
- proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
- advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
