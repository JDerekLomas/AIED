To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and the common misconceptions associated with it. The question requires students to calculate \(0.7^2\). A common error in students' work is misplacing the decimal point or misunderstanding the operation, especially when dealing with decimals.

## Step 1: Understand the Calculation
The calculation \(0.7^2\) means \(0.7 \times 0.7\). This is a straightforward multiplication of decimals.

## 2: Identify Potential Misconceptions
One potential misconception is that students might incorrectly calculate or misplace the decimal point. For example, some might think \(0.7^2 = 0.7 \times 10^{-2}\) or simply not perform the calculation correctly.

## 3: Analyze the Options
- A: \(0.49\)
- B: \(1.4\)
- C: \(0.14\)
- D: \(4.9\)

Let's calculate \(0.7^2\):
\(0.7 \times 0.7 = 0.49\)

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic calculations and are more likely to make errors. They might choose B, C, or D due to miscalculation or misunderstanding of exponents and decimals. A=40% (correct calculation but might be a guess), B=30% (possibly thinking \(0.7 \times 2 = 1.4\)), C=15% (miscalculation), D=15% (significant miscalculation).
- **Basic:** Students here have a good grasp of basics but might still make simple errors. A=70% (should know this), B=20% (simple error), C=5% (less common error), D=5% (significant error).
- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with calculations and less likely to make simple errors. A=90% (confident in calculation), B=5%, C=2.5%, D=2.5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident and accurate in their calculations. A=98% (very confident), B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

## 5: Translate to Requested Format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
- basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
- proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2.5% D=2.5%
- advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2.5% D=2.5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
