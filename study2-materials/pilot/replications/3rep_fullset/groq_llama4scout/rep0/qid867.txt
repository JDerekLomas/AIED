To approach this question, let's first understand the content and the common misconceptions associated with expanding and simplifying the expression \( (x-4)^{2} \).

The correct expansion of \( (x-4)^{2} \) is \( (x-4)(x-4) = x^{2} - 4x - 4x + 16 = x^{2} - 8x + 16 \). 

A common misconception might involve errors in handling the signs or in applying the formula \( (a-b)^{2} = a^{2} - 2ab + b^{2} \), which in this case would give \( x^{2} - 2 \cdot x \cdot 4 + 4^{2} = x^{2} - 8x + 16 \).

Now, let's analyze the options given:
- A: \( x^{2} - 8x + 16 \) - This is the correct expansion.
- B: \( x^{2} + 16 \) - This suggests a mistake where the middle term \( -8x \) is omitted and not the square applied properly.
- C: \( x^{2} - 16 \) - This is incorrect as it misses both the middle term \( -8x \) and incorrectly applies the constant term.
- D: \( x^{2} - 8x - 16 \) - This option incorrectly suggests a negative constant term.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the algebraic expansion and are more likely to choose options that reflect common errors. Option B (\( x^{2} + 16 \)) might appeal because it looks like what you get if you just square the \( -4 \) and ignore \( x \), and option C (\( x^{2} - 16 \)) might seem right if one only considers \( (x)^{2} - (4)^{2} \) without applying the proper algebraic expansion. Option D could be chosen if one incorrectly applies a subtraction in the expansion. A=20% (as they might guess), B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.

- **Basic**: At this level, students are more likely to recognize the need for a \( -8x \) term but might still make errors on the constant term. The correct answer A should be more appealing but errors in calculation or applying formulas could lead to B, C, or D. A=50%, B=20%, C=20%, D=10%.

- **Proficient**: Students here are expected to handle algebraic expansions confidently. The majority should choose A. Errors might still occur but less frequently. A=85%, B=5%, C=5%, D=5%.

- **Advanced**: These students are highly confident in their algebraic manipulations and are less likely to make errors. A=98%, B=1%, C=1%, D=0%.

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
