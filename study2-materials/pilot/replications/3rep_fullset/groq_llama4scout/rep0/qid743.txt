To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with function machines and algebraic expressions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Function Machine
The function machine takes an input \(x\), adds 10 to it, and then multiplies the result by 3. Algebraically, this can be represented as \(3(x + 10)\).

## 2: Algebraic Representation
To find the algebraic representation of the function machine's output:
\(3(x + 10) = 3x + 30\).

## 3: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom says the output is \(3x + 30\). This matches our algebraic representation, so Tom is correct.

## 4: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie says the output is \(10 + 3x\). This can also be seen as \(3x + 10\), which does not match our correct algebraic representation of \(3x + 30\). Thus, Katie is incorrect.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic expressions and the concept of function machines. They might not fully understand how to apply the operations in the correct order or might confuse the steps. Therefore, they could be more likely to choose incorrect options or struggle to identify who is correct.
  - A (Only Tom): 40%
  - B (Only Katie): 20%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 10%
  - D (Neither is correct): 30%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and function machines but might still make errors in applying the operations, especially if they misunderstand the order of operations or how the machine's steps are applied.
  - A (Only Tom): 60%
  - B (Only Katie): 20%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 5%
  - D (Neither is correct): 15%

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a good grasp of algebraic concepts and can apply them correctly. They are likely to understand the function machine's process and identify Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect.
  - A (Only Tom): 80%
  - B (Only Katie): 10%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 5%
  - D (Neither is correct): 5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also explain and apply them accurately. They will easily identify Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness.
  - A (Only Tom): 90%
  - B (Only Katie): 5%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 0%
  - D (Neither is correct): 5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
