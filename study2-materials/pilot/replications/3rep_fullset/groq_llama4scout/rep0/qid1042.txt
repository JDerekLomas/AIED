## Step 1: Understand the quadratic equation given
The equation provided is \((5x+2)(2x-5)=0\). To find the solutions, we set each factor equal to zero. So, we have \(5x+2=0\) and \(2x-5=0\).

## 2: Solve the first equation for x
Solving \(5x+2=0\) gives \(5x=-2\), and thus \(x=-\frac{2}{5}\).

## 3: Solve the second equation for x
Solving \(2x-5=0\) gives \(2x=5\), and thus \(x=\frac{5}{2}\).

## 4: Evaluate Tom's solution
Tom says one solution is \(x=\frac{2}{5}\). However, from our calculations, \(x=-\frac{2}{5}\) or \(x=\frac{5}{2}\) are the solutions. So, Tom is incorrect.

## 5: Evaluate Katie's solution
Katie says one solution is \(x=-\frac{5}{2}\). From our calculations, the solutions are \(x=-\frac{2}{5}\) and \(x=\frac{5}{2}\). Katie's solution, \(x=-\frac{5}{2}\), does not match either of the correct solutions. So, Katie is also incorrect.

## 6: Determine the correct answer
Since both Tom and Katie provided solutions that do not match the actual solutions to the equation, the correct answer is that neither is correct.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand how to solve quadratic equations or might confuse the steps. They might incorrectly agree with Tom or Katie or choose randomly. Given the simplicity of the question, let's assume they have a higher chance of selecting an incorrect option due to lack of understanding. So, \(A=20\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=50\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to understand the concept of setting each factor to zero but could miscalculate. Let's assume \(A=15\%\), \(B=15\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=60\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the method and can apply it correctly. They are less likely to make errors in calculation but might still fall for obvious misconceptions. Given the straightforward nature of the solutions, let's assume \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=85\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply the concepts accurately. They are unlikely to make mistakes in solving the equation. Thus, \(A=0\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=0\%\), \(D=100\%\).

## 8: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=10% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=10% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
