## Step 1: Understand the question and the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for the given question about finding the value of \( R \) in the expression \( x(2x - 1) + 3(4x - 2) \equiv Px^2 + Qx + R \).

## 2: Solve the expression to find \( R \)
To find \( R \), we need to expand and simplify the given expression:
\[ x(2x - 1) + 3(4x - 2) = 2x^2 - x + 12x - 6 = 2x^2 + 11x - 6 \]

## 3: Identify \( R \) from the simplified expression
Comparing the simplified expression \( 2x^2 + 11x - 6 \) to \( Px^2 + Qx + R \), it's clear that \( R = -6 \).

## 4: Analyze the question for potential misconceptions or traps
The question seems straightforward as it directly asks for the value of \( R \) after expanding and simplifying the given expression. There are no obvious traps or misconceptions that would lead students astray, assuming they can correctly expand and simplify the expression.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly expand the terms or might get confused with the constants. Given the simplicity of the expression but the potential for algebraic errors, there's a chance they might select incorrect options due to miscalculation. However, the question does not seem to trigger a common misconception directly; it's more about algebraic skill.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to handle basic algebraic expansions and simplifications. They might still make some errors but are more likely to get it right.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily expand and simplify the expression to find \( R = -6 \) correctly.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level would likely have no issues with the algebraic manipulations and would correctly identify \( R = -6 \).

## 6: Estimate percentages for each option
Given that \( R = -6 \), and assuming most students can handle the algebra:
- **Below_basic**: Might have a higher chance of error, let's say A=10%, B=10%, C=20%, D=60% (though this group might struggle more, the actual distribution could vary widely).
- **Basic**: Should have a good chance of getting it right, A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80%.
- **Proficient**: Would likely get it right, A=2%, B=2%, C=5%, D=91%.
- **Advanced**: Nearly all would get it right, A=1%, B=1%, C=2%, D=96%.

## 7: Finalize predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the question and assuming typical student performance:
- **below_basic**: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
- **basic**: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
- **proficient**: A=2% B=2% C=5% D=91%
- **advanced**: A=1% B=1% C=2% D=96%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=5% D=91%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=2% D=96%
