To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of writing \(0.5\%\) as a fraction, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question requires converting \(0.5\%\) into a fraction. \(0.5\% = 0.005\) in decimal form. To convert \(0.005\) into a fraction, we note that \(0.005 = \frac{5}{1000} = \frac{1}{200}\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Options
- Option A: \(\frac{1}{2}\) is equivalent to \(0.5\) or \(50\%\), which is far from \(0.5\%\).
- Option B: \(\frac{1}{20}\) is equivalent to \(0.05\) or \(5\%\), which is also not \(0.5\%\).
- Option C: \(\frac{1}{200}\) is equivalent to \(0.005\) or \(0.5\%\), which matches the target.
- Option D: \(\frac{1}{2000}\) is equivalent to \(0.0005\) or \(0.05\%\), which is less than \(0.5\%\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be misunderstanding the percentage sign or the decimal conversion. For instance, some might confuse \(0.5\%\) with \(0.5\) or \(\frac{1}{2}\), or incorrectly convert percentages to decimals/fractions.

## 3: Analyzing by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions. They might confuse \(0.5\%\) with \(5\%\) or \(0.5\), leading them to choose B or A. Some might not understand percentages well, potentially choosing D due to misunderstanding the conversion. \(A = 40\%\), \(B = 30\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 10\%\).

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless errors. They are likely to recognize \(0.5\%\) as less than \(1\%\), potentially choosing B. However, they should be more inclined to choose C with some guidance. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 40\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 10\%\).

- **Proficient:** These students should accurately convert \(0.5\%\) to a fraction. They are likely to choose C confidently. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 80\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their conversions. They will almost certainly choose C and might not even consider the other options due to their strong understanding. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 95\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
