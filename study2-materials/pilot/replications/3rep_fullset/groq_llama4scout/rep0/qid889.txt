To approach this question, let's first solve the inequality \(20 \geq 8m\) and then evaluate the statements made by Tom and Katie.

## Step 1: Solve the inequality
To solve \(20 \geq 8m\), we divide both sides by 8. This gives us \(m \leq \frac{20}{8}\) or \(m \leq 2.5\).

## 2: Evaluate Tom's statement
Tom says \(m\) could be \(2.5\). Since \(2.5 \leq 2.5\), Tom is correct.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's statement
Katie says \(m\) could be \(3\). Since \(3 > 2.5\), Katie is incorrect.

## 4: Determine the correct answer
Given that Tom is correct and Katie is incorrect, the correct answer is A) Only Tom.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with solving the inequality and understanding the comparison. They might not accurately solve the inequality or might misinterpret the statements. A significant portion might choose D) Neither is correct or B) Only Katie due to a lack of understanding. 
  - A=30% (some can check Tom's statement but struggle with Katie's)
  - B=20% (misunderstand inequality)
  - C=10% (incorrectly think both are right)
  - D=40% (think neither is correct due to misunderstanding)

- **Basic**: Students here can solve the inequality but might make errors in checking the statements. They are more likely to understand the inequality but could be tricked by Katie's statement without calculation.
  - A=60% (can solve and check Tom)
  - B=20% (might believe Katie without checking)
  - C=10% (think both are correct)
  - D=10% (not confident in their maths)

- **Proficient**: These students can accurately solve the inequality and evaluate both statements correctly. They understand the concept and can apply it.
  - A=80% (clearly see Tom is correct, Katie is not)
  - B=5% (unlikely to mistakenly think only Katie)
  - C=5% (unlikely to think both are correct)
  - D=10% (only if very careful and still unsure)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only solve the inequality correctly but also have a deep understanding of the implications. They are highly likely to choose the correct answer.
  - A=95% (confidently identify Tom as correct)
  - B=0% (rarely mistaken)
  - C=0% (recognize Katie's error)
  - D=5% (extremely unlikely)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
