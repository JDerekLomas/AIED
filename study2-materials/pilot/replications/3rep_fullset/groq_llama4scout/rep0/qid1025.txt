To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The question asks for the solutions to the simultaneous equations represented by two straight lines on a graph. The lines intersect at the point (2,2). This question tests the students' ability to interpret graphical data and understand that the solution to a system of linear equations is the point of intersection of their graphs.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task requires students to identify the point of intersection from a graph, which is a fundamental concept in algebra and geometry. This task is relatively straightforward as it directly involves reading a value from a graph.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions or Difficulties
One potential difficulty could be if students misread the graph or were not able to accurately identify the point of intersection. However, given that the point of intersection (2,2) is clearly marked and the lines and axes are labeled with simple, easy-to-read values, this seems less likely to be a major issue for most students.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( x=3, \quad y=6 \) corresponds to a point on the red line but not the intersection.
- Option B: \( x=6, \quad y=3 \) corresponds to a point on the blue line but not the intersection.
- Option C: \( x=2, \quad y=2 \) is the correct point of intersection.
- Option D: \( x=2, \quad y=1 \) is close but not the correct point of intersection.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with reading graphs or understanding the concept of intersection. They might choose options that seem plausible but are incorrect, such as A or B. Option C might be challenging for them to identify correctly.
  - A: 30% 
  - B: 30% 
  - C: 20% 
  - D: 20%

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make mistakes in reading the graph accurately or understanding what the intersection represents. They are more likely to choose the correct answer but still have a chance of selecting nearby or related points.
  - A: 15% 
  - B: 15% 
  - C: 60% 
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient:** Students at this level are expected to accurately read the graph and understand the concept of solving simultaneous equations graphically. They should have a high chance of selecting the correct option.
  - A: 5% 
  - B: 5% 
  - C: 85% 
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are likely to have a deep understanding of the concepts and be able to apply them accurately. They should almost universally choose the correct option.
  - A: 0% 
  - B: 0% 
  - C: 95% 
  - D: 5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
