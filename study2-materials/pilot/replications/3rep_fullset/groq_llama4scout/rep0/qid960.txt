To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 4(3c + 2) \), let's consider what the question entails and common misconceptions.

The question requires the application of the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials), which is a fundamental concept in algebra. The correct expansion of \( 4(3c + 2) \) is \( 12c + 8 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception students might have is not multiplying each term inside the parentheses by the factor outside correctly. For example, they might forget to multiply the constant term by the factor.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \( 7c + 6 \), suggests a misunderstanding where the student might have added the numbers inside the parentheses and then multiplied by 4, or simply made a calculation error.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( 12c + 8 \), is the correct answer. It demonstrates a correct application of the distributive property: \( 4 \times 3c = 12c \) and \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \).

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( 12c + 6 \), implies that the student correctly multiplied \( 4 \times 3c \) to get \( 12c \) but incorrectly multiplied \( 4 \times 2 \) to get \( 6 \) instead of \( 8 \).

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( 12c + 2 \), suggests the student correctly got \( 12c \) but then only added 2, ignoring the multiplication of 4 by 2.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication and addition. They are likely to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding of the distributive property. 
  - A: 20% (error in calculation and misunderstanding of the operation)
  - B: 30% (some might get it right by chance or partial understanding)
  - C: 30% (partially correct, multiplying 4 by 3c but not 4 by 2 correctly)
  - D: 20% (another incorrect calculation)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes.
  - A: 10% (less likely to make severe errors)
  - B: 60% (most understand the concept but might make minor errors)
  - C: 20% (a common mistake not multiplying the constant term correctly)
  - D: 10% (less common error)

- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of algebraic concepts.
  - A: 5% (unlikely to make basic errors)
  - B: 80% (most get it right)
  - C: 10% (occasional mistake)
  - D: 5% (rare error)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have a deep and secure understanding.
  - A: 0% (unlikely to choose an obviously incorrect option)
  - B: 95% (almost all get it right)
  - C: 3% (rare mistake)
  - D: 2% (very rare error)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
