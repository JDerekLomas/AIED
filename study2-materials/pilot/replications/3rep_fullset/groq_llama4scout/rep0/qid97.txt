To approach this question, let's consider the concepts involved and how they might affect students at different ability levels.

The question involves understanding several key concepts in geometry:
1. **Alternate angles**: These are equal angles that occur on opposite sides of a transversal line intersecting two other lines.
2. **Corresponding angles**: These are equal angles that occur in the same relative position at an intersection of a transversal with two lines.
3. **Vertically opposite angles**: These are angles that are opposite each other when two lines intersect, and they are always equal.
4. **Angles on a straight line**: These add up to 180 degrees.

Given the diagram described, with two marked angles in orange and two unmarked angles between them on either side, the marked angles are **vertically opposite angles** because they are formed by two lines intersecting and are opposite each other.

Let's predict the performance:

- **Below Basic**: At this level, students may struggle with vocabulary and basic concepts. They might not understand the terms or might confuse them. However, the visual cue of the angles being opposite each other might help some.
  - A=20% (some might mistakenly think they are alternate due to lack of understanding)
  - B=15% (corresponding angles might be confused due to similar-sounding terms)
  - C=40% (visually, they are opposite, which could help)
  - D=25% (some might think they are on a straight line if they misunderstand the layout)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying definitions in context.
  - A=10% (less likely to confuse with alternate)
  - B=10% (less confusion with corresponding)
  - C=60% (should recognize them as vertically opposite)
  - D=20% (less likely to think they are on a straight line)

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of geometric concepts and should easily identify the relationship.
  - A=5% (unlikely to confuse with alternate)
  - B=5% (unlikely to confuse with corresponding)
  - C=85% (should confidently identify as vertically opposite)
  - D=5% (unlikely to confuse with angles on a straight line)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them in complex situations. They are less likely to make mistakes.
  - A=0% (not likely to confuse with alternate)
  - B=0% (not likely to confuse with corresponding)
  - C=95% (will accurately identify as vertically opposite)
  - D=5% (very unlikely to confuse with angles on a straight line)

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
