To approach this question, let's consider the conditions for drawing regular polygons by connecting dots in a ring of equally spaced dots. A regular polygon has all sides and angles equal. The number of dots and their spacing determine which regular polygons can be formed.

## 1. Understanding the Basics of Regular Polygons and Dot Patterns
- A regular polygon can be drawn if the number of sides of the polygon divides the total number of dots evenly, or more precisely, if the number of dots is a multiple of the number of sides of the polygon, considering the rotational symmetry and equal spacing.

## 2. Analyzing the Given Information
- The question mentions drawing a regular octagon. An octagon has 8 sides.
- This implies the ring of dots must have a number that is a multiple of 8 for an octagon to be drawn.

## 3. Determining Possible Regular Polygons
- For an equilateral triangle (A), the number of dots must be a multiple of 3.
- For a square (B), the number of dots must be a multiple of 4.
- For a pentagon (C), the number of dots must be a multiple of 5.
- For a hexagon (D), the number of dots must be a multiple of 6.

## 4. Relating to the Octagon
- Since an octagon can be drawn, and it requires a multiple of 8 dots, any regular polygon that can be drawn must have a number of sides that divides 8 (or a multiple of 8) without a remainder, considering the dot pattern's symmetry.

## 5. Considering Each Option
- **Equilateral Triangle (A)**: Requires a multiple of 3 dots. Not directly related to 8, but if the total dots are a multiple of 8, they could also be a multiple of 24 (LCM of 3 and 8), making it possible under certain conditions.
- **Square (B)**: Requires a multiple of 4 dots. Since 8 is a multiple of 4, any octagon-drawable configuration (multiple of 8 dots) automatically allows for a square.
- **Pentagon (C)**: Requires a multiple of 5 dots. Not directly compatible with multiples of 8 unless the dots are a multiple of 40 (LCM of 5 and 8), making it possible under certain conditions.
- **Hexagon (D)**: Requires a multiple of 6 dots. Since 8 and 6 have an LCM of 24, a configuration that allows an octagon also allows a hexagon under certain conditions.

## 6. Making Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students here might struggle with the basic geometry. They might not understand the divisibility requirement or the concept of least common multiples (LCM). They could randomly pick or choose based on simple associations rather than geometric principles. 
  - A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic geometric shapes but might struggle with the abstract connections. They'd likely recognize that squares (B) are easily formed from dots (as it's a common and simple shape), and might overlook the necessity of the dot number being a multiple for other shapes.
  - A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
- **Proficient**: These students understand geometric principles, including the relationship between dot patterns and polygon construction. They'd likely recognize that if an octagon can be drawn, a square can definitely be drawn because 4 is a factor of 8.
  - A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
- **Advanced**: Students here have a strong understanding of geometry and number theory. They'd quickly realize that drawing an octagon implies a certain level of dot density that allows for other polygons, particularly those whose side numbers divide into 8 or its multiples. They'd accurately deduce that a square is definitely drawable.
  - A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
