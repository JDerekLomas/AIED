To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and the ease with which students at different levels might convert a fraction to a percentage.

The fraction given is \( \frac{4}{5} \). This is a straightforward conversion that many students should be familiar with. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Fraction to Percentage Conversion
To convert a fraction to a percentage, one method is to convert the fraction to a decimal and then multiply by 100. For \( \frac{4}{5} \), dividing 4 by 5 gives 0.8. Multiplying 0.8 by 100 gives 80%.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrectly converting the fraction or misunderstanding the relationship between fractions and percentages. However, \( \frac{4}{5} \) is a well-known fraction that equates to 80%, making it less likely for students to fall into common traps if they have a basic understanding of fractions and percentages.

## 3: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions. They might not know how to convert a fraction to a decimal or might make calculation errors. Given the straightforward nature of \( \frac{4}{5} \), some might still guess or use prior knowledge to get 80%, but errors are more likely. 
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a grasp of converting simple fractions to percentages. They might make some calculation errors but should generally understand the concept.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily convert \( \frac{4}{5} \) to 80% without issue, having a solid understanding of fractions, decimals, and percentages.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will also easily convert \( \frac{4}{5} \) to 80%, and their responses are likely to be accurate.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given the simplicity of the question and the commonality of the fraction \( \frac{4}{5} \), most students, even at the basic level, should be able to answer correctly.

- **Below Basic:** A=60% (some might know this from memory or guess), B=20%, C=10%, D=10% (errors and wild guesses).
- **Basic:** A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5% (most get it right, some make calculation errors).
- **Proficient:** A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1% (very few errors).
- **Advanced:** A=99%, B=0.5%, C=0.25%, D=0.25% (extremely few errors).

The best answer is A. 

Below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
Basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
Proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
Advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
