## Step 1: Understanding the concept of modal age
The modal age is the age that appears most frequently in the given table. To find it, we need to look for the age with the highest frequency.

## 2: Analyzing the given table
From the table provided:
- Age 18 has a frequency of 7.
- Age 19 has a frequency of 3.
- Age 20 has a frequency of 1.
- Age 21 has a frequency of 2.

## 3: Identifying the modal age
The highest frequency is 7, which corresponds to age 18. Therefore, the modal age is 18.

## 4: Evaluating the answer choices
- A: \( 18 \) is the correct modal age.
- B: \( 19.5 \) is not relevant to the modal age calculation.
- C: \( 7 \) is the frequency of the modal age, not the modal age itself.
- D: \( 21 \) is not the modal age.

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of mode or misread the table. They might choose C (7) because it's a prominent number, or they might not understand what "modal age" means, leading to random guesses. A=60% (correct, but could be guessed), B=10%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic statistical terms but might make simple errors. They are likely to understand the concept of mode but could be distracted by other numbers. A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept of mode and can apply it correctly. They are less likely to make errors. A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but also can apply it without errors. They might even check for other modes, but given the data, 18 is clearly the mode. A=99%, B=0.5%, C=0.5%, D=0%.

## 6: Converting predictions into percentages
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
- **basic:** A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
- **advanced:** A=99% B=0.5% C=0.5% D=0%

The best answer is below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.5% D=0%
