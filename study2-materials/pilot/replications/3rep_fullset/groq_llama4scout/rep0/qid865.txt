To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question provides a graph of a negative quadratic curve that crosses the x-axis at (-5,0) and (1,0). This implies the roots of the quadratic equation are -5 and 1. A quadratic equation can be represented in the form of \(y = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\), where \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) are the roots.

Given the roots are -5 and 1, the general form of the equation should be \(y = a(x + 5)(x - 1)\) or \(y = a(x - 1)(x + 5)\), where \(a\) is a negative coefficient to reflect the negative quadratic graph.

Let's analyze the options:

A: \(y = (1 - x)(x + 5)\) can be rewritten as \(y = -(x - 1)(x + 5)\), which matches our required form with a negative \(a\).

B: \(y = (1 - x)(5 - x)\) does not match because its roots are 1 and 5, not -5 and 1.

C: \(y = (x - 1)(x + 5)\) directly matches the form with \(a = 1\), but since the graph is negative, \(a\) should be negative. However, this option does not account for the negative sign.

D: \(y = (x - 1)(x - 5)\) has roots of 1 and 5, which does not match.

The correct equation reflecting a negative quadratic with roots -5 and 1 would involve a negative \(a\), and the factors should be \((x + 5)\) and \((x - 1)\) or \((1 - x)\) and \((x + 5)\) to reflect the roots correctly.

## Predicting Student Responses

### below_basic
- Students at this level might struggle with the algebraic representation and graph interpretation.
- A: \(20\%\) (some might recognize the form but not ensure the negative)
- B: \(30\%\) (distracting factor with similar numbers)
- C: \(30\%\) (seems correct but lacks the negative sign explicitly)
- D: \(20\%\) (incorrect roots)

### basic
- Students here have a basic understanding but might miss the implication of the graph being negative.
- A: \(40\%\) (recognize the correct roots and form)
- B: \(20\%\) (still a bit distracting)
- C: \(25\%\) (common but lacks negative sign)
- D: \(15\%\) (incorrect)

### proficient
- These students should understand the relationship between the graph and equation.
- A: \(60\%\) (correct form and roots)
- B: \(10\%\) (less likely to be chosen)
- C: \(20\%\) (common mistake, not accounting for negative)
- D: \(10\%\) (clearly incorrect)

### advanced
- Students at this level should accurately interpret and apply their knowledge.
- A: \(80\%\) (accurately reflects a possible equation)
- B: \(5\%\) (unlikely)
- C: \(10\%\) (minor mistake)
- D: \(5\%\) (clear error)

Given these considerations, the predicted percentages in the required format are:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
