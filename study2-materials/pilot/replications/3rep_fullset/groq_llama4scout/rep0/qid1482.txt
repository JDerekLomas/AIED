To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it presents.

The question involves finding the size of angle \( y \) in a diagram where three lines cross at a point, forming six angles. One angle is marked as \( 43^{\circ} \), and another as \( y \), with two blank angles between each marked angle.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The diagram shows three lines intersecting at a point. The angles formed around a point add up to \( 360^{\circ} \). However, to find \( y \) directly, we need to consider the relationship between the angles given and \( y \). Since one angle is \( 43^{\circ} \) and assuming the two blank angles between the marked angles are equal due to vertical angles being equal, we still need a direct relationship or additional information to solve for \( y \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be that angles on a straight line add up to \( 90^{\circ} \) (which is incorrect, as they add up to \( 180^{\circ} \)), or not recognizing that vertically opposite angles are equal. However, the question seems to test the understanding of angles around a point and possibly the properties of intersecting lines.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 43^{\circ} \) suggests that \( y \) is equal to the given angle, implying a misunderstanding of angle properties.
- Option B: \( 137^{\circ} \) could suggest a calculation error or misunderstanding of how angles relate around a point or on a line.
- Option C: \( 47^{\circ} \) might imply a minor calculation mistake or incorrect assumption about the angle measurements.
- Option D: "Not enough information" suggests that the student recognizes they cannot solve for \( y \) with the given data.

## 4: Relating to Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic angle concepts. They might incorrectly assume \( y = 43^{\circ} \) (A) due to a lack of understanding of angle properties, or choose randomly.
- **Basic:** Basic level students might understand some properties of angles but could struggle with applying them in complex scenarios. They might choose A or C due to simple errors in calculation or understanding.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students should understand that angles on a straight line add to \( 180^{\circ} \) and around a point to \( 360^{\circ} \), but might still make errors if they misinterpret the diagram or calculations. They are less likely to choose A but might consider B or C if they apply the concepts incorrectly.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students should easily recognize that \( y \) and \( 43^{\circ} \) are supplementary because they form a straight line. Hence, \( y = 180^{\circ} - 43^{\circ} = 137^{\circ} \), making B the correct answer.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the correct answer is \( 137^{\circ} \) (B), and assuming most students can see that \( y \) and \( 43^{\circ} \) are on a straight line:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (simple mistake), B=20% (lucky guess), C=20% (another mistake), D=20% (not understanding).
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=40%, C=25%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=70%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=90%, C=5%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=10% D=15%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
