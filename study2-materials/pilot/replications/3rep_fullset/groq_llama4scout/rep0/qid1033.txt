## Step 1: Understand the problem and the misconception it aims to test
The question presents two scenarios involving Chris and Amy ordering cups of tea and a cake, with different total costs. It aims to test students' ability to set up and solve equations to find the cost of one cup of tea, potentially revealing misconceptions in algebraic manipulation or equation solving.

## 2: Set up the equations based on the given information
Let \(t\) be the cost of one cup of tea and \(c\) be the cost of a cake. From Chris's order: \(3t + c = 3.10\). From Amy's order: \(5t + c = 4.50\).

## 3: Solve the equations to find the cost of one cup of tea
Subtracting the first equation from the second gives: \(2t = 1.40\), which simplifies to \(t = 0.70\).

## 4: Analyze the question for potential pitfalls
The question seems straightforward but requires students to correctly set up and solve the equations. A common misconception could involve incorrectly subtracting the equations or misinterpreting the given information.

## 5: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with setting up the equations or solving them. They might not recognize how to use the information given to solve for \(t\), potentially leading to random guesses or incorrect calculations.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the need for equations but could struggle with solving them accurately, possibly leading to errors in calculation or substitution.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to set up the equations correctly and solve them, but might still make minor arithmetic errors.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to solve the problem accurately with minimal chance of error.

## 6: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
Given the solution \(t = 0.70\) or \(70p\), and assuming students who understand the problem will calculate it correctly:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20% (Guessing or incorrect calculations)
- **Basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10% (Some correct calculations, but errors possible)
- **Proficient**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5% (Most solve it correctly, few errors)
- **Advanced**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1% (Almost all solve it correctly)

## 7: Adjust predictions based on the specific question and common misconceptions
Given that the correct answer is \(70p\) (A), and considering common errors in calculation or algebraic manipulation, the predictions should reflect a high success rate among proficient and advanced students, with a significant chance of error among lower ability levels.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
