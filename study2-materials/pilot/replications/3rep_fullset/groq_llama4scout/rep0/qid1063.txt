To approach this question, let's consider the characteristics of the function \( y = \frac{4}{x} \) and how students at different ability levels might respond.

The function \( y = \frac{4}{x} \) has two asymptotes: a vertical asymptote at \( x = 0 \) and a horizontal asymptote at \( y = 0 \). For \( x < 0 \), \( y \) is negative, and for \( x > 0 \), \( y \) is positive. The graph provided shows two branches of the hyperbola, one in the first quadrant and one in the third quadrant.

## Step 1: Understanding the Function
The function \( y = \frac{4}{x} \) implies that as \( x \) increases, \( y \) decreases, and vice versa, in their respective quadrants. When \( x = -1 \), substituting into the equation yields \( y = \frac{4}{-1} = -4 \).

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the quadrants or not understanding the inverse relationship between \( x \) and \( y \). However, given the graph and the straightforward nature of the question, students are less likely to make significant errors if they can read the graph or substitute \( x = -1 \) into the equation.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with substituting \( x = -1 \) into the equation or reading the graph accurately. They might choose an option based on a misreading of the graph or a simple calculation error. Given the graph provided, option B (\( -4 \)) is directly supported by the graph and calculation. Expect a high chance of error, but the correct answer is visually supported: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%.
- **Basic:** Students here are likely to understand the basic substitution but might make calculation errors. The graph helps; they can see \( (-1, -4) \) on the graph. Thus, A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to get it right easily, either by calculation or by recognizing the point on the graph. Hence, A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level will almost certainly get it right, having a deep understanding of the function's behavior. So, A=1% B=95% C=3% D=1%.

## 4: Finalizing Predictions
Based on these considerations, here are the predictions:

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=3% D=1%
