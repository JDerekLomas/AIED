To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's first analyze the question and the graph provided.

The graph shows a straight line passing through the origin (0,0) and the points (20,16) and (25,20). This implies that the line represents a linear relationship between the distance traveled in miles (on the x-axis) and the amount paid in pounds (on the y-axis).

## Step 1: Determine the equation of the line
First, we find the gradient (m) of the line using two points: (20,16) and (25,20).
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{20 - 16}{25 - 20} = \frac{4}{5} \]
The line passes through the origin, so the y-intercept (c) is 0. Thus, the equation of the line is:
\[ y = \frac{4}{5}x \]

## 2: Solve for x when y = 100
Given that Kay’s company paid her £100, we substitute y = 100 into the equation to find x:
\[ 100 = \frac{4}{5}x \]
Solving for x:
\[ x = 100 \times \frac{5}{4} = 125 \]

## 3: Analyze the options
- A: 80
- B: 100
- C: 125
- D: 120

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and errors
A common error might be misinterpreting the graph or not using it correctly to find the rate of pay per mile. However, given that the graph provides clear points and the relationship is linear, students who understand linear relationships and can read the graph should be able to solve it.

## 5: Predict student responses by ability level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with reading the graph, understanding the concept of a linear relationship, or calculating the rate of change. They might choose an option by guessing or incorrect calculation. Given the straightforward nature of the question once the equation is understood, they might be more likely to guess or make a calculation error. Thus, A=40%, B=30%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of graphs and linear relationships. They might make simple calculation errors or misinterpret the graph. However, they should be able to get the correct answer with some effort. So, A=20%, B=25%, C=45%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level understand linear relationships and can apply them to solve problems. They should easily solve the equation and find the correct answer. Thus, A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand linear relationships but can also apply more complex mathematical concepts. They should have no trouble solving this question. So, A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The best answer is C. 
Below analysis shows the format required for answer:

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
