To tackle this problem, let's first analyze what it's testing and then consider the potential pitfalls for students at different levels.

This question is designed to test students' ability to set up and solve equations, specifically in the context of simultaneous equations or finding the cost of one item when given two scenarios. The equations based on the given information are:

1) \(2t + c = 1.40\)
2) \(4t + c = 2.20\)

Where \(t\) is the cost of one cup of tea and \(c\) is the cost of a cake.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question seems straightforward but requires students to either solve these equations simultaneously or find a way to eliminate one of the variables to solve for \(t\), the cost of one cup of tea.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions or Errors
A common misconception might involve incorrectly setting up the equations or not being able to solve them correctly. However, given the numbers, this problem might actually be quite straightforward for students who have a basic grasp of algebra.

## 3: Solving the Equations
Subtracting the first equation from the second equation eliminates \(c\):
\(4t + c - (2t + c) = 2.20 - 1.40\)
This simplifies to:
\(2t = 0.80\)
Therefore, \(t = 0.40\) or \(40p\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with setting up equations or solving them. They might not even attempt to solve it algebraically, or they might make simple arithmetic errors. Given the simplicity of the numbers and the fact that one option is the correct answer derived directly from solving the equations, we might expect a significant portion to guess or not attempt it, but among those who do, errors could be high. Let's predict: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
- **Basic:** These students should have a decent grasp of basic algebra. They might make some errors in calculation but should be able to set up the equations. Let's assume most would get it right or make a simple mistake: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
- **Proficient:** Students at this level should easily solve the equations and find \(t = 40p\). Errors should be minimal: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Advanced:** These students not only solve it easily but might also see the question as an easy win. Errors should be very low: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

## 5: Formatting the Response
Given these predictions:
- below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
- basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
