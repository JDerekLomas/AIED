To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks students to compare the fraction of a rectangle that is shaded in each diagram to decide which one is the odd one out. The fractions given are:
- A: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- B: \( \frac{2}{6} \)
- C: \( \frac{3}{9} \)
- D: \( \frac{6}{12} \)

All these fractions, when simplified, equal \( \frac{1}{3} \) except for none; they all actually represent the same proportion of the rectangle being shaded because:
- \( \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \)
- \( \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \)
- \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \)

The key insight here is recognizing that \( \frac{6}{12} \) simplifies to \( \frac{1}{2} \), not \( \frac{1}{3} \), which makes option D the odd one out since the others all represent \( \frac{1}{3} \) of their respective rectangles.

## Step 1: Identify the Odd One Out
The odd one out is D because \( \frac{6}{12} \) equals \( \frac{1}{2} \), whereas the others equal \( \frac{1}{3} \).

## 2: Consider Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be not simplifying the fractions or comparing them incorrectly. Students might not recognize that \( \frac{2}{6} \), \( \frac{3}{9} \), and \( \frac{1}{3} \) are equivalent, or they might simplify \( \frac{6}{12} \) incorrectly.

## 3: Analyze by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with fraction simplification and comparison. They might choose randomly or based on superficial similarities rather than actual values. Hence, a significant portion might choose incorrectly, but given the visual nature, some might still get it right by instinct or basic understanding.

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding of fractions. They might still make errors in simplification but are more likely to recognize the equivalence of \( \frac{1}{3} \) in options A, B, and C. The challenge would be in accurately simplifying \( \frac{6}{12} \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \) and recognizing it as different.

- **Proficient:** These students are expected to simplify fractions accurately and compare them. They should easily recognize that D is the odd one out because \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \), which is different from \( \frac{1}{3} \).

- **Advanced:** Students at this level would not only simplify fractions but also understand the concept well enough to quickly identify D as the odd one out without needing extensive calculation.

## 4: Prediction
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20% (Many might pick randomly or based on non-mathematical cues)
- **Basic:** A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40% (Some recognize D is different, but might be split)
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85% (Most correctly identify D as the odd one out)
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100% (All correctly identify D)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
