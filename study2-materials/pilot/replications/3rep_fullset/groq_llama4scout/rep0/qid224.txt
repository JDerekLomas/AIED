To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the length of one side of a square with an area of \( 64 \mathrm{~mm}^{2} \), let's first understand the misconceptions and the straightforward nature of this question.

The question requires the student to understand that the area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{side}^2 \). Therefore, to find the length of one side of the square, one must take the square root of the area.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Solution
The area of the square is \( 64 \mathrm{~mm}^{2} \). So, the side length is \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \mathrm{~mm} \).

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Errors
- A common misconception might be confusing the operations or not understanding the relationship between area and side length. However, this question is quite straightforward.
- Option A (\( 16 \mathrm{~mm} \)) could be a result of mistakenly thinking \( 64 = 16 \times 4 \) or similar incorrect calculations.
- Option B (\( 32 \mathrm{~mm} \)) seems unrelated as there's no simple operation (like doubling or multiplying by a small integer) that connects 64 directly to 32 in the context of squares and areas.
- Option D (\( 4096 \mathrm{~mm} \)) seems to be \( 64^2 \), suggesting a misunderstanding of the relationship between the area and the side length.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic mathematical operations or understanding the concept of area and side length. They might choose randomly or based on very superficial understanding. So, \( C = 30\% \) (correct, due to guessing or basic understanding), \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( D = 30\% \).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make calculation errors. They are likely to get it right or make simple mistakes. So, \( C = 60\% \), \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( D = 10\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and can apply them. Mistakes here would be minimal. So, \( C = 90\% \), \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 3\% \), \( D = 2\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less likely to make errors. So, \( C = 98\% \), \( A = 1\% \), \( B = 0.5\% \), \( D = 0.5\% \).

## 4: Converting to Requested Format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=3% C=90% D=2%
- advanced: A=1% B=0.5% C=98% D=0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=3% C=90% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=0.5% C=98% D=0.5%
