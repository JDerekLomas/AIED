## Step 1: Understand the question and the common misconception
The question requires students to expand and simplify the expression \((p+5)(p-4)\) and then compare it to \(p^{2} \triangle p \bigcirc\) to find the value that should replace the circle (\(\bigcirc\)). The expansion of \((p+5)(p-4)\) is \(p^2 - 4p + 5p - 20 = p^2 + p - 20\).

## 2: Identify the correct form and potential errors
The correct form to match \(p^2 + p - 20\) with \(p^{2} \triangle p \bigcirc\) implies that \(\triangle = 1\) (coefficient of \(p\)) and \(\bigcirc = -20\) (constant term). A common misconception could involve errors in expanding the brackets or in comparing coefficients.

## 3: Analyze the potential for errors by ability level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with expanding the brackets and could easily make mistakes in arithmetic or in writing down the terms. They might incorrectly expand \((p+5)(p-4)\) to \(p^2 + 5p - 4p - 20 = p^2 + p - 20\) but then misinterpret the constant term or the coefficient of \(p\).

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might still make simple arithmetic errors or confusion between \(\triangle\) and \(\bigcirc\). They should be able to expand \((p+5)(p-4)\) correctly to \(p^2 + p - 20\), but might choose incorrect options due to oversight or simple miscalculation.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students should easily expand and simplify \((p+5)(p-4)\) to \(p^2 + p - 20\). They are less likely to make errors in identifying \(\bigcirc = -20\), given their understanding of algebraic manipulations.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students will not only expand and simplify correctly but also quickly and accurately identify \(\bigcirc = -20\) without much deliberation, as this is a straightforward application of algebraic rules.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the nature of the question:
- The correct answer is \(\bigcirc = -20\), which corresponds to option D.
- Option A (\(\bigcirc = +1\)) seems unrelated to the constant term.
- Option B (\(\bigcirc = +20\)) is a possible mistake if students incorrectly add or subtract the constants.
- Option C (\(\bigcirc = -9\)) could result from incorrect arithmetic.

## 5: Assign percentages based on ability levels and potential for error
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (random guess), B=20% (mistake in calculation), C=10% (another mistake), D=30% (some get it right by chance or correct calculation).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=15% (oversight), C=5%, D=70% (mostly correct).
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85% (high accuracy).
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (no errors expected).

## 6: Finalize the prediction
Assuming a distribution across these groups (though the exact percentages can vary based on the student population), a rough estimate could be:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=10% B=15% C=5% D=70%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The best answer is D.
