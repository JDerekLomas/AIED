To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The relationship given is \(\frac{a}{b+c} = a \div (b+c)\). This equation is essentially testing the understanding that division by a fraction (or in this context, a sum of variables) is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of that fraction. However, the question here seems to be more about the recognition of the equivalence between the division and the fraction notation rather than a complex algebraic manipulation.

The statement \(\frac{a}{b+c} = a \div (b+c)\) is actually always true because dividing by a quantity is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. The notation \(\frac{a}{b+c}\) implies \(a \times \frac{1}{b+c}\), which is \(a \div (b+c)\). This equivalence does not depend on the values of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) (as long as \(b+c \neq 0\)), making the statement fundamentally true.

However, students might be confused if they misunderstand the operations or if they think about specific values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that could make the statement seem false. But given \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are different numbers, and without specific values that would make \(b+c = 0\), the general algebraic identity holds.

## Step 1: Understanding the Algebraic Identity
The given relationship is an identity and holds true for all non-zero \(b+c\), which is a reasonable assumption given \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are different numbers, implying \(b+c\) would not necessarily be zero unless specifically defined as such.

## 2: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic notation and could easily be misled into thinking the statement could be sometimes true or always false due to a lack of understanding of the operations. They might not recognize the equivalence, leading to \(A=40\%\), \(B=30\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=10\%\).

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic grasp of algebra but might still be prone to errors in understanding the notation. They might see the statement as sometimes true because they consider cases where \(b+c=0\), but generally, they should start to understand the equivalence, leading to \(A=20\%\), \(B=25\%\), \(C=45\%\), \(D=10\%\).

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid understanding of algebra and should recognize the statement as always true, given the basic principles of division and fractions. They are less likely to be misled by potential zeros or other misconceptions, resulting in \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=85\%\), \(D=5\%\).

- **Advanced:** At this level, students not only understand the algebraic equivalence but also the conditions under which it holds (i.e., \(b+c \neq 0\)). However, given \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are just stated to be different, they should confidently assert the statement is always true without deeper conditions, leading to \(A=0\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=95\%\), \(D=5\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
