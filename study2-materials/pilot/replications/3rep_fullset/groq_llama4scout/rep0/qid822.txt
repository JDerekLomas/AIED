To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the characteristics of an exponential function and the given graphs.

An exponential function has the form $y = ab^x$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive constants, and $b \neq 1$. A key feature of exponential functions is that they have a horizontal asymptote (usually the x-axis) and pass through the y-axis at $(0, a)$. If $b > 1$, the function increases rapidly; if $0 < b < 1$, it decreases gradually towards the x-axis but never touches it.

- **Option A** describes a graph that starts just above the x-axis on the left, increases gradually at first, then more steeply. It goes through a point on the y-axis above the origin and continually rises steeply. This behavior matches that of an exponential function with $b > 1$.
- **Option B** describes a graph with two curves in different quadrants, behaving like a hyperbolic function rather than an exponential one. It does not match the characteristics of a simple exponential function.
- **Option C** describes a graph that turns at the origin and changes direction, which does not match the behavior of an exponential function.
- **Option D** describes a symmetric U-shaped graph, which is more indicative of a quadratic function than an exponential function.

Given these characteristics:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle to identify key features of functions. 
  - A: 30% (some might recognize the increasing nature but not necessarily the asymptotic behavior)
  - B: 25% (misinterpreting the graph's asymptotic behavior)
  - C: 20% (incorrectly identifying a turning point as characteristic of exponential functions)
  - D: 25% (confusing with quadratic or other symmetric functions)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may still confuse types of functions.
  - A: 50% (recognizing the general shape but might not be confident)
  - B: 20% (still may confuse with known graphs)
  - C: 15% (understanding that exponentials don't typically have sharp turns)
  - D: 15% (similar confusion with symmetric graphs)

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of function types.
  - A: 80% (can accurately describe and recognize exponential growth)
  - B: 5% (unlikely to confuse with exponential given their understanding)
  - C: 5% (understand the shape and growth patterns of exponential functions)
  - D: 10% (may still see some symetry or misinterpret)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their understanding.
  - A: 95% (easy recognition of exponential function characteristics)
  - B: 0% (clearly not an exponential function)
  - C: 0% (no confusion with turning points characteristic of other functions)
  - D: 5% (highly unlikely to confuse with exponential)
