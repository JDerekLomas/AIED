To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The graph shows a linear relationship where 10 miles = £8. This implies that for every 10 miles, Kay gets £8. To find out how many miles Kay traveled for £80, students need to understand the rate at which she is paid per mile and then calculate the total miles.

First, determine the rate per mile: £8 for 10 miles means £0.80 per mile.

Then, to find out how many miles Kay traveled for £80: £80 / £0.80 per mile = 100 miles.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question is straightforward and tests the student's ability to interpret a linear graph and perform a simple calculation based on the information given.

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors
A common error could be misinterpreting the graph or not understanding the linear relationship. However, the question provides a clear ratio (£8 to 10 miles), which should help students calculate the miles traveled for £80 directly.

## 3: Analyzing Option A (96 miles)
This option might attract students who miscalculate or misunderstand the graph. For example, if a student mistakenly thinks the rate is £8 for 12 miles or uses an incorrect conversion, they might end up with a wrong answer.

## 4: Analyzing Option B (100 miles)
This is the correct answer. £80 / £0.80 (which is £8/10 miles) = 100 miles. Students who understand the linear relationship and can perform the calculation correctly will choose this option.

## 5: Analyzing Option C (64 miles)
This might seem plausible to students who incorrectly calculate or assume a different ratio. For instance, if they mistakenly use £8 = 8 miles or a similar incorrect conversion.

## 6: Analyzing Option D (80 miles)
This option might attract students who incorrectly assume a direct proportionality without calculating the rate per mile correctly or misunderstand the question.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below_basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the graph and performing calculations. They might choose options based on incorrect calculations or misunderstandings. A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple calculation errors. A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
- **Proficient:** These students understand linear relationships and can perform calculations accurately. A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can apply them accurately and efficiently. A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%

The best answer is B. 

Given the predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
