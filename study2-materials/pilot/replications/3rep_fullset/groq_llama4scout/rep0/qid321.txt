To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question asks students to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows in the expression \((5p-4)(2p-3)\), which are \(5p\) and \(-3\). The correct calculation is \(5p \times -3 = -15p\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception when multiplying terms with variables is forgetting to apply the sign correctly or misunderstanding the operation. In this case, the multiplication of \(5p\) by \(-3\) could lead to errors if students forget that a positive times a negative gives a negative.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(-15p\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(+15p\) might be chosen by students who forget that multiplying a positive by a negative yields a negative.
- Option C: \(+2p\) and Option D: \(+8p\) seem to involve incorrect operations or misunderstandings of the terms being multiplied.

## 3: Ability Levels and Predicted Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication and applying signs. They might choose B (incorrectly thinking the product of two numbers is positive) or make errors in calculation. A=40% (some get it right by chance or basic understanding), B=30% (common misconception), C=15%, D=15%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still fall into traps. They are more likely to get it right but could be tempted by B. A=60%, B=25%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the multiplication rules and are less likely to make sign errors. A=85%, B=10%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their algebraic manipulations and are unlikely to make mistakes. A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

## 4: Formatting the Response
Given the predictions:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
