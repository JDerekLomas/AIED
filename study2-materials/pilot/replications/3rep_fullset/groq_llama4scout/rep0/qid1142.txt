To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the process of completing the square.

The equation given is \( p^{2} - p - 1 \equiv (p \bigstar )^{2} \triangle \). To complete the square for \( p^{2} - p - 1 \), we take the coefficient of \( p \), which is \( -1 \), divide it by 2, and then square it: \( \left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^{2} = \frac{1}{4} \). So, \( p^{2} - p + \frac{1}{4} \) would be a perfect square, \( \left(p - \frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} \). Therefore, to make \( p^{2} - p - 1 \) a perfect square, we need to add and subtract \( \frac{1}{4} \) inside the expression, but since we're comparing to \( (p \bigstar)^{2} \), we focus on the form \( (p - \frac{1}{2})^{2} \) which implies \( \bigstar = -\frac{1}{2} \) or \( -0.5 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Completing the Square Process
The process of completing the square for \( p^{2} - p - 1 \) involves creating a perfect square trinomial. The standard form is \( (p + b)^{2} = p^{2} + 2bp + b^{2} \). For \( p^{2} - p - 1 \), we want \( 2bp = -p \), implying \( b = -\frac{1}{2} \).

## 2: Identifying the Correct Option
The correct completion to make \( p^{2} - p - 1 \) into a square of the form \( (p \bigstar)^{2} \) would thus involve \( \bigstar = -\frac{1}{2} \) because \( (p - \frac{1}{2})^{2} = p^{2} - p + \frac{1}{4} \), and adjusting for the \( -1 \), we see the equation as \( p^{2} - p - 1 = (p^{2} - p + \frac{1}{4}) - \frac{1}{4} - 1 = (p - \frac{1}{2})^{2} - \frac{5}{4} \). This implies \( \bigstar = -0.5 \) or \( D \).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
Students might confuse the process or misinterpret the equation. A common misconception could involve incorrectly calculating \( \bigstar \) or misunderstanding the adjustment needed for the constant term.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of completing the square and could randomly select options or choose based on a very superficial understanding. They might lean towards simple or intuitive answers like \( \bigstar = -1 \) (B) or \( \bigstar = -0.5 \) (D) without deep calculation, but errors would be common. \( A = 10\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 40\% \).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and might apply basic formulas. They could still make mistakes but are more likely to attempt the calculation. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 15\% \), \( D = 60\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students understand completing the square well and are likely to get it right, with a strong chance of selecting \( D = -0.5 \). \( A = 2\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 83\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident and knowledgeable. They would almost certainly choose the correct option. \( A = 1\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 2\% \), \( D = 92\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=2% B=10% C=5% D=83%
advanced: A=1% B=5% C=2% D=92%
