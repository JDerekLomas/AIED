To approach this question, let's consider the concepts involved and the potential pitfalls for students at different levels.

The question requires students to understand the concept of symmetry, specifically reflection symmetry. The correct answer involves reflecting the given shape across the line of symmetry and ensuring that the colored squares are in their corresponding places on the reflected shape.

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept of Symmetry
Students need to grasp that a symmetric figure has two halves that are mirror images of each other. The line of symmetry acts as a mirror line. For a shape to be symmetric about a line, reflecting one half of the shape across that line should perfectly align with the other half.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A suggests a reflection but with the colored squares not in their corresponding places.
- Option B suggests a translation (movement) rather than a reflection, which does not address symmetry across a line.
- Option C shows a reflection with the colored squares in their corresponding places, which aligns with the definition of symmetry.
- Option D seems to be an error or repetition of Option A.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding symmetry. They might confuse reflection with translation or not accurately place colored squares. Thus, they might be inclined towards B (translation error) or A/D (reflection but incorrect placement).
- **Basic:** Basic level students have a grasp of basic geometric concepts. They are more likely to recognize that symmetry involves reflection but might still struggle with accurately applying it, especially with the colored squares' placement.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand symmetry and can apply it. They are likely to choose C as they can reflect the shape and align the colored squares correctly.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand symmetry but can also handle more complex shapes and accurately reflect them across a line, ensuring correct placement of details like colored squares.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (some understanding of reflection), B=40% (misunderstanding symmetry as translation), C=20% (correct but challenging), D=10% (possibly confusing or similar to A).
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=30%, C=40%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=5%, B=0%, C=90%, D=5%.

The best answer is C. 

Below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
