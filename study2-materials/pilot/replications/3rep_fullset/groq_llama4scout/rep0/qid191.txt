To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the task and the potential pitfalls for students at different levels.

The task requires students to compare numbers close to -2 and determine which one is closest to zero. The numbers given are:
- A: \( -2.1 \)
- B: \( -2.01 \)
- C: \( -2.105 \)
- D: \( -3 \)

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept
The concept here is to understand that the closer a negative number is to zero, the larger it is. Students need to compare these numbers and find the one that is closest to zero, which means finding the number that is algebraically closest to 0.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A is \( -2.1 \).
- Option B is \( -2.01 \), which is very close to -2.
- Option C is \( -2.105 \), slightly more negative than -2.1.
- Option D is \( -3 \), which is further from zero than all the other options.

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to think that the larger the absolute value of a negative number, the closer it is to zero, which is incorrect. Another potential issue could be with the precision of the numbers given, especially with more decimal places.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with comparing negative numbers or understanding decimal places. They might choose based on the size of the number without considering its distance to zero properly. \( D = 40\% \) (since -3 seems far away but they might not calculate precisely), \( A = 25\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 15\% \). 
  - Below Basic: A=25% B=20% C=15% D=40%

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of negative numbers and can compare them. However, they might still be tricked by the decimals. \( B = 40\% \) (correct answer), \( A = 25\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 15\% \).
  - Basic: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%

- **Proficient:** Students here understand negative numbers and decimals well. They should easily see that B (\( -2.01 \)) is closest to zero. \( B = 70\% \), \( A = 15\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
  - Proficient: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the concept but can also work with precision. They would quickly identify B as the closest to zero. \( B = 90\% \), \( A = 5\% \), \( C = 3\% \), \( D = 2\% \).
  - Advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
