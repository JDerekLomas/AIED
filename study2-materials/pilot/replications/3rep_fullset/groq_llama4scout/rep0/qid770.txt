To approach this question, let's analyze the potential misconceptions and the calculations involved.

The question involves multiplying a fraction by a whole number: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 9 \). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Calculation
To calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \times 9 \), we multiply the numerator by 9 and keep the denominator the same, which gives \( \frac{1 \times 9}{5} = \frac{9}{5} \). This can also be expressed as \( 1\frac{4}{5} \) since \( \frac{9}{5} = 1 + \frac{4}{5} \).

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Response
Tom says \( \frac{1}{5} \times 9 = 1\frac{4}{5} \), which is correct based on the calculation in Step 1.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Response
Katie says \( \frac{1}{5} \times 9 = \frac{9}{45} \). To see if this is correct, we simplify \( \frac{9}{45} \) to \( \frac{1}{5} \), which does not match \( \frac{1}{5} \times 9 \). However, let's properly assess her calculation: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 9 = \frac{1 \times 9}{5} = \frac{9}{5} \), and if we express \( \frac{9}{5} \) with a denominator of 45, it becomes \( \frac{9 \times 9}{5 \times 9} = \frac{81}{45} \), not \( \frac{9}{45} \). So, Katie's response is incorrect.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic fraction operations. They might not understand how to multiply a fraction by a whole number or might not simplify fractions correctly. Tom's answer seems plausible because it results in a mixed number, which they might find familiar. Katie's answer seems incorrect but might confuse some due to the fraction. However, most would likely struggle, and incorrect answers would be common. 
  - A (Only Tom): 30%
  - B (Only Katie): 10%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 5%
  - D (Neither is correct): 55%

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple errors. They should recognize Tom's answer as correct. Katie's mistake might be recognized by some, but others might be confused. 
  - A (Only Tom): 60%
  - B (Only Katie): 15%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 5%
  - D (Neither is correct): 20%

- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to understand the operations accurately. They should easily identify Tom's correctness and Katie's error.
  - A (Only Tom): 80%
  - B (Only Katie): 5%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 2%
  - D (Neither is correct): 13%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of the concepts and should easily see that Tom is correct and Katie is not.
  - A (Only Tom): 90%
  - B (Only Katie): 2%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 1%
  - D (Neither is correct): 7%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=5% D=55%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=1% D=7%
