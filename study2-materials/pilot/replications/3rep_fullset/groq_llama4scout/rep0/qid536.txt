To solve this, let's first calculate the distances of the given points from the origin and then determine the correctness of Tom's and Katie's statements.

## Step 1: Calculate the distance of \( (3,-2) \) and \( (2,-3) \) from the origin.
The distance \(d\) of a point \((x, y)\) from the origin is given by \(d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).
For \( (3,-2) \), \(d_1 = \sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4} = \sqrt{13}\).
For \( (2,-3) \), \(d_2 = \sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{13}\).
Since \(d_1 = d_2\), Tom is correct.

## 2: Calculate the distance of \( (4,1) \) and \( (7,-2) \) from the origin.
For \( (4,1) \), \(d_3 = \sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{16 + 1} = \sqrt{17}\).
For \( (7,-2) \), \(d_4 = \sqrt{7^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 4} = \sqrt{53}\).
Since \(d_3 \neq d_4\), Katie is incorrect.

## 3: Determine the correctness of the statements.
Given that Tom is correct and Katie is incorrect, the correct answer is A) Only Tom.

## 4: Predicting student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand how to calculate distances from the origin or might confuse the concepts. They might randomly select an option or choose based on a misconception without calculation. Given the simplicity of the calculations required, some might still get it right by chance or by correctly applying the distance formula. However, errors in calculation and conceptual understanding are common. Let's assume A=30% (chance of picking the right option without understanding), B=20% (might think Katie's statement could be true without calculation), C=10% (unlikely to think both are correct without calculation), D=40% (not understanding either statement).

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of the distance formula but might make calculation errors or not fully understand the implications. They are likely to attempt calculations but might not always arrive at the correct conclusion. Let's assume A=50% (correct calculation leading to the right choice), B=25% (incorrect calculation or assumption), C=5% (unlikely to think both are correct), D=20% (calculate but conclude incorrectly).

- **Proficient**: These students understand the distance formula and can apply it accurately. They are likely to get the question right. Let's assume A=80% (calculate correctly and choose Tom), B=10% (might miscalculate or misunderstand), C=5% (unlikely), D=5% (very unlikely to conclude neither is correct).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the formula but can also analyze the problem quickly. They are highly likely to get it right. Let's assume A=90% (quick and accurate calculation), B=5% (unlikely to make a mistake), C=3% (very unlikely), D=2% (extremely unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
