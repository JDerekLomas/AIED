To approach this question, let's first solve the inequality \(15 \geq 4m\) to understand the range of values \(m\) can take.

## Step 1: Solve the inequality
To solve \(15 \geq 4m\), we divide both sides by 4, which gives us \(3.75 \geq m\). This means \(m\) can be any value less than or equal to 3.75.

## 2: Evaluate Tom's statement
Tom says \(m\) could be 4. Given \(m \leq 3.75\), if \(m = 4\), it does not satisfy the inequality because 4 is greater than 3.75.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's statement
Katie says \(m\) could be 3.75. Since \(m \leq 3.75\), \(m = 3.75\) satisfies the inequality.

## 4: Determine the correctness of statements
- Tom is incorrect because \(m = 4\) does not satisfy \(15 \geq 4m\).
- Katie is correct because \(m = 3.75\) satisfies \(15 \geq 4m\).

## 5: Analyze the question for potential misconceptions
The question tests the understanding of inequalities and the ability to substitute values into them. A common misconception might involve misunderstanding the direction of the inequality or not checking the boundary value correctly.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with solving the inequality or substituting values. They might incorrectly think Tom is right or both are right due to a lack of understanding of inequalities. \(A = 30\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 20\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might make simple algebraic mistakes. They are likely to realize Tom is wrong but might be unsure about Katie. \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 40\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 20\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students can solve the inequality and understand substitution. They should easily see Tom is wrong and Katie is right. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 60\%\), \(C = 25\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of inequalities and algebraic manipulation. They will quickly identify Tom as incorrect and Katie as correct. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 80\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 10\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=25% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=80% C=10% D=10%
