To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to similar shapes and volume scale factors.

The question provides two similar cuboids, P and Q, with widths of 5cm and 15cm, respectively. The task is to find the volume scale factor from Shape P to Shape Q.

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept of Similar Shapes
Similar shapes have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. This means that corresponding angles are equal and the corresponding sides are in proportion.

## 2: Calculating the Linear Scale Factor
The linear scale factor from P to Q can be calculated by dividing the width of Q by the width of P: \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \). This means that every linear dimension of Q is 3 times the linear dimension of P.

## 3: Understanding Volume Scale Factor
The volume scale factor between two similar 3D shapes is the cube of the linear scale factor. Therefore, if the linear scale factor is 3, the volume scale factor is \( 3^3 = 27 \).

## 4: Analyzing the Options
Given the correct calculation, the volume scale factor to get from Shape P to Shape Q is \( \times 27 \) (Option D).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the concept of similar shapes and scale factors. They might confuse the linear scale factor with the volume scale factor or not understand how to calculate the volume scale factor. A significant portion might choose A (\( \times 3 \)), thinking the scale factor for volume is the same as for length, so A=40%, B=20%, C=15%, D=25%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a basic understanding of scale factors but might still make errors in applying the concept to volumes. They might choose A (\( \times 3 \)) or B (\( \times 6 \)) due to misunderstandings, so A=20%, B=30%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept of similar shapes and can calculate both linear and volume scale factors. However, under pressure or if not fully attentive, some might still opt for the linear scale factor or incorrectly calculate it, so A=5%, B=10%, C=15%, D=70%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of the concepts and calculate accurately. The majority should choose D (\( \times 27 \)) without hesitation, so A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95%.

## 6: Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
- basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- proficient: A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
