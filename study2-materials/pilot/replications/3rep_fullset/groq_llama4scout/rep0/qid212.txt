To approach this question, let's analyze the conditions given: \( x < -1 \) or \( x \geq 2 \), and how they should be represented on a number line.

- \( x < -1 \) means all values of \( x \) are less than -1. On a number line, this is represented with an open circle at -1 and an arrow pointing to the left.
- \( x \geq 2 \) means all values of \( x \) are greater than or equal to 2. On a number line, this is represented with a closed circle at 2 and an arrow pointing to the right.

## Step 1: Understanding the Conditions
The correct representation should have an open circle at -1 with an arrow to the left (for \( x < -1 \)) and a closed circle at 2 with an arrow to the right (for \( x \geq 2 \)).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- A: Open circle at -1 with an arrow to the left, and an open circle at 2 with an arrow to the right. Incorrect because the circle at 2 should be closed.
- B: Closed circle at -1 with an arrow to the left, and a closed circle at 2 with an arrow to the right. Incorrect because the circle at -1 should be open.
- C: Open circle at -1 with an arrow to the left, and a closed circle at 2 with an arrow to the right. Correct.
- D: Closed circle at -1 with an arrow to the left, and an open circle at 2 with an arrow to the right. Incorrect because the circle at -1 should be open and the circle at 2 should be closed.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the notation and representation. They might choose B (20%), thinking the closed circle at -1 is correct for \( x < -1 \), and incorrectly interpret the conditions. A (30%) could be chosen due to a lack of understanding of the inequality signs. C (20%) and D (30%) might see some selection but likely less than A and B.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding but might still make careless mistakes. C (60%) should be the most popular choice as students understand the basic concept. A (20%) and D (10%) might be chosen by those who misinterpret one part of the conditions. B (10%) could be selected by those who misunderstand both conditions.
- **Proficient:** Students here have a solid grasp of inequalities. C (80%) is expected to be the top choice. A (10%), B (5%), and D (5%) might see some selection due to oversight or misinterpretation.
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately. C (90%) should be chosen by most. A (5%), B (2%), and D (3%) might see minimal selection.

## 4: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
- **Basic:** A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
- **Proficient:** A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
- **Advanced:** A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
