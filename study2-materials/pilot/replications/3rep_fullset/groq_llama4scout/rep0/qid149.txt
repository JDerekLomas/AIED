## Step 1: Understand the question and the concept of range
The question asks for the range of a set of numbers: 0.31, 0.30, 0.331. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the set.

## 2: Calculate the range
To find the range, we first identify the highest and lowest numbers. The highest number is 0.331 and the lowest is 0.30. The range is calculated as 0.331 - 0.30 = 0.031.

## 3: Analyze the potential for misconceptions
A common misconception could involve incorrectly identifying the highest or lowest numbers or making a calculation error. However, given the numbers are relatively simple and not extremely close in value (which could lead to confusion), most students should be able to identify the correct range.

## 4: Evaluate the answer choices
The correct answer is C) 0.031. Let's consider how students at different ability levels might respond:
- A) 0.021: This would be a mistake, possibly from miscalculating the range or incorrectly identifying the numbers.
- B) 0.301: This seems unrelated to the actual calculation.
- C) 0.031: This is the correct answer.
- D) 0.21: This is a significant overestimation.

## 5: Predict student responses by ability level
### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with the concept of range or with comparing decimal numbers. They might incorrectly calculate the range or choose an answer that seems large or small based on intuition rather than calculation.
- A=20% (miscalculation), B=10% (unrelated), C=40% (correct, but might be by chance), D=30% (significant error).

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of decimals and range but might make simple calculation errors.
- A=10% (error), B=5% (unrelated), C=70% (correct), D=15% (error).

### proficient
Students at this level should accurately calculate the range with ease.
- A=5% (minor error), B=2% (unrelated), C=90% (correct), D=3% (significant error).

### advanced
Students at this level are likely to understand the concept well and calculate accurately.
- A=2% (minor error), B=1% (unrelated), C=95% (correct), D=2% (significant error).

## 6: Convert predictions into the required format
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=70% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=70% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%
