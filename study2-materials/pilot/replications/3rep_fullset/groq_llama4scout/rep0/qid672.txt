To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "How many degrees are there in three-quarters of a turn?", let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it might pose.

The question tests the understanding of fractions of a turn and their relation to degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees. Therefore, three-quarters of a turn would be \(\frac{3}{4} \times 360 = 270\) degrees.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with fractions and degree measurements. They might not accurately recall that a full turn is 360 degrees or struggle with calculating \(\frac{3}{4} \times 360\). 
  - A: \( 75\degree \) might seem reasonable if they incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the fraction of a turn.
  - B: \( 90\degree \) could be chosen if they think of a right angle as a quarter turn and mistakenly apply it.
  - C: \( 180\degree \) might be selected if they consider half a turn.
  - D: \( 270\degree \) is the correct answer but might be challenging for this group to arrive at accurately.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make errors in calculations or recalling key facts.
  - A: \( 75\degree \) could be chosen by those who miscalculate or misunderstand the concept.
  - B: \( 90\degree \) might be picked by those who incorrectly apply fraction knowledge.
  - C: \( 180\degree \) could be considered by those who think in terms of half turns.
  - D: \( 270\degree \) should be more accessible as a correct answer.

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of fractions and degree measurements.
  - A: \( 75\degree \) and B: \( 90\degree \) and C: \( 180\degree \) are incorrect and might be chosen by those slightly less confident in their calculations or due to momentary lapses in understanding.
  - D: \( 270\degree \) is likely to be the most chosen answer.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a very strong understanding and be able to apply their knowledge accurately.
  - The correct answer, D: \( 270\degree \), should be universally recognized as the correct choice with minimal errors.

Given these considerations and typical performance expectations:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=20% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
