## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a pair of simultaneous linear equations:
\[4x+y=7\]
\[3x+2y=4\]
Students are asked to find a correct solution from the given options.

## 2: Solving the Equations
To solve these equations, one common method is to use elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination here:
- Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the \(y\) terms: \(8x + 2y = 14\)
- The second equation remains: \(3x + 2y = 4\)
- Subtract the second equation from the modified first equation to eliminate \(y\): \((8x - 3x) + (2y - 2y) = 14 - 4\)
- This simplifies to: \(5x = 10\), so \(x = 2\)
- Substitute \(x = 2\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(y\): \(4(2) + y = 7\), which simplifies to \(8 + y = 7\), so \(y = -1\)

## 3: Analyzing the Options
Given the solution \(x = 2\) and \(y = -1\), let's look at the options:
- A: \(x = 2, y = -1\)
- B: \(x = 3, y = -5\)
- C: \(x = 0.6, y = 4.6\)
- D: \(x = 10, y = -33\)

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with solving simultaneous equations or might not even attempt to solve them, potentially guessing or using incorrect methods. Option A is the correct answer, so we expect a low percentage here. Given the nature of the question, some might guess or get it by chance, but errors in calculation or method would be common.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make calculation errors or not fully understand the method. They might correctly solve the equations but could also be tempted by other options if they made mistakes in their calculations.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to accurately solve the equations using appropriate methods. They should identify A as the correct solution with minimal errors.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only solve the equations correctly but also understand the underlying algebra. They should easily identify A as the correct solution.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of solving these equations and the clear correct answer:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (guessing or partially correct method), B=20%, C=20%, D=40% (wild guesses)
- **Basic**: A=60% (correct solution with minimal errors), B=20% (some calculation errors), C=10%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=90% (accurate solutions), B=5%, C=3%, D=2%
- **Advanced**: A=98% (virtually all solve it correctly), B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%
