## Step 1: Understand the question and the Venn diagram
The question provides a Venn diagram showing the prime factors of 36 and 90. For 36, the prime factors are 2 and 2, and 3 and 3. For 90, the prime factors are 2, 3, 3, and 5. The intersection shows the shared prime factors between 36 and 90, which are 2, 3, and 3.

## 2: Identify the prime factors of 36 and 90
The prime factorization of 36 is \(2^2 \times 3^2\), and of 90 is \(2 \times 3^2 \times 5\).

## 3: Determine the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 36 and 90
To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. So, for 2, that's \(2^2\); for 3, that's \(3^2\); and for 5, that's \(5^1\). Thus, the LCM is \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5\).

## 4: Translate the LCM into the given options
The LCM \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5\) translates to \(2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5\).

## 5: Evaluate the options
- A: \(2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5\) matches our calculation for the LCM.
- B: \(2 \times 3 \times 3\) is missing \(2\), \(5\), and has only one \(2\).
- C: \(2 \times 5\) misses \(3 \times 3\).
- D: \(2 \times 3 \times 5\) misses \(3\) and an extra \(2\).

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with prime factorization and understanding Venn diagrams. They might not accurately identify the prime factors or understand how to use them to find the LCM. Option A seems correct but might be hard for them to derive. They could easily choose B, C, or D due to misunderstandings. **A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%**
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make errors in applying them. They should be able to identify prime factors but might struggle with combining them for LCM. **A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%**
- **Proficient**: These students understand prime factorization and can apply it to find LCMs. They should easily identify the correct option. **A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%**
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately and efficiently. They are likely to choose the correct option without hesitation. **A=90% B=2% C=2% D=6%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=2% D=6%
