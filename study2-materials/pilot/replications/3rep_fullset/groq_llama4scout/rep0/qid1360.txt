To approach this question, let's analyze the content and potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question requires finding an equivalent fraction to \( \frac{9}{12} \). To solve this, students can simplify \( \frac{9}{12} \) or find a common multiplier/ divisor to compare with the given options.

## Step 1: Simplifying \( \frac{9}{12} \)
\( \frac{9}{12} \) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. This results in \( \frac{3}{4} \).

## 2: Analyzing Options
- Option A: \( \frac{12}{16} \) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4, resulting in \( \frac{3}{4} \).
- Option B: \( \frac{2}{3} \) does not simplify to \( \frac{3}{4} \) and is not equivalent.
- Option C: \( \frac{12}{15} \) simplifies to \( \frac{4}{5} \), which is not equivalent.
- Option D: "None of these" would be incorrect if any of the above options match \( \frac{9}{12} \).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with simplifying fractions or comparing them. They might not simplify \( \frac{9}{12} \) correctly or might not see the equivalence. Option A could be chosen if they incorrectly simplify or compare, but they might also choose B or C due to a lack of understanding. D might be chosen if they don't recognize any equivalent. 
  - A=20% (some might see the numbers are all increasing), B=30% (common fraction but not equivalent), C=20%, D=30%.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and can simplify fractions. They might quickly see that \( \frac{9}{12} \) simplifies to \( \frac{3}{4} \) and look for an equivalent. 
  - A=40% (recognize the equivalence), B=20% (know \( \frac{2}{3} \) isn't it), C=10%, D=30%.

- **Proficient**: These students are confident in simplifying and comparing fractions. They will easily identify \( \frac{9}{12} \) as \( \frac{3}{4} \) and find that \( \frac{12}{16} \) is equivalent.
  - A=70%, B=10%, C=5%, D=15%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can quickly see relationships between fractions. They will have no trouble identifying \( \frac{12}{16} \) as equivalent.
  - A=90%, B=5%, C=0%, D=5%.

## 4: Conclusion
Given the analysis, the predictions are:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
- proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
- advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
