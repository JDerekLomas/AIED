To approach this question, let's analyze the problems presented and the common misconceptions or understanding students might have regarding the order of operations.

## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
The order of operations is a fundamental concept in mathematics, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) in the UK. This rule dictates the order in which operations should be performed in a mathematical expression.

## 2: Analyzing Problem P
Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \). According to the order of operations, when there are only addition and subtraction operations (or only multiplication and division), we perform the operations from left to right. Therefore, the correct order for Problem P is to first do \( 4-5 \) and then add 6.

## 3: Analyzing Problem Q
Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). Following the order of operations (BIDMAS), multiplication should be performed before addition. Therefore, the correct order for Problem Q is to first do \( 5 \times 6 \) and then add 4.

## 4: Evaluating the Options
- Option A suggests doing \( 4-5 \) first in Problem P and \( 4+5 \) first in Problem Q. For Problem P, this is correct (\( 4-5 \) first), but for Problem Q, it's incorrect because \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done first.
- Option B suggests doing \( 4-5 \) first in Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) first in Problem Q. This aligns with the correct order of operations for both problems.
- Option C suggests doing \( 5+6 \) first in Problem P and \( 4+5 \) first in Problem Q. This is incorrect for both problems based on the order of operations.
- Option D suggests doing \( 5+6 \) first in Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) first in Problem Q. For Problem P, \( 5+6 \) should not be done first; \( 4-5 \) should be done first.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might choose options based on a superficial understanding or guesswork. Option A might appeal to those who misunderstand or don't apply BIDMAS correctly, while Option B reflects the correct understanding. Given the simplicity and clarity needed for such a question, most below-basic students might struggle, leaning towards incorrect options like A or C.
- **Basic**: Basic level students are expected to have some understanding of basic mathematical operations but might still struggle with applying the order of operations consistently. They might be more likely to choose B as it seems logically correct but could still be tempted by A or C due to partial understanding.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students should have a solid grasp of the order of operations. They are likely to choose B as it correctly applies BIDMAS.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand but can also apply the order of operations with ease. They would also choose B, as it is the correct option.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (misunderstanding), B=30% (some understanding), C=20% (incorrect but might seem logical to some), D=10%.
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=3%, D=2%.

The best answer is B. 

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
