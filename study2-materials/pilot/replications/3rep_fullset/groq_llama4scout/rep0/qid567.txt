To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question involves expanding the product of two binomials, \((x-8)(x-2)\), and specifically asks for the product of the terms indicated by the arrows, which are \(x\) from the first bracket and \(-2\) from the second bracket. The correct calculation for these terms is \(x \times -2 = -2x\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task requires multiplying \(x\) by \(-2\), which should yield \(-2x\). This is a fundamental aspect of algebra and should be straightforward for students with a basic understanding of algebraic operations.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve ignoring the negative sign or misunderstanding the operation. For instance, some students might incorrectly calculate \(x \times -2\) as \(x + 2\), \(x - 2\), or simply \(2x\), due to not properly accounting for the negative sign.

## 3: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \(x + 2\) would be incorrect because it mistakenly adds \(2\) instead of multiplying by \(-2\).
- Option B: \(-2x\) is the correct answer, resulting from \(x \times -2\).
- Option C: \(x - 2\) suggests a subtraction rather than multiplication by \(-2\).
- Option D: \(+2x\) ignores the negative sign altogether.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic operations. They might incorrectly choose options that reflect a lack of understanding of multiplication with negatives or simply not know how to proceed. Expect a high chance of incorrect responses, potentially scattered across A, C, and D, with A and D being particularly tempting due to the common errors of mishandling the negative sign or simply not performing the operation correctly.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a grasp of basic algebra, including multiplying terms. However, they might still fall into traps. Option B should be more frequently chosen, but there could still be a significant percentage choosing D due to overlooking the negative sign.
- **Proficient:** Students here should reliably choose B, as they understand algebraic operations well. There might be a few errors, possibly due to carelessness, but these should be minimal.
- **Advanced:** These students are expected to not only understand but also apply algebraic concepts accurately. The correct answer, B, should be chosen consistently, with very few, if any, errors.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation and assuming typical student performance:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (adding instead of multiplying), B=20% (correct but struggling), C=20% (subtracting), D=30% (ignoring negative sign).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=70%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=98%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
