To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the reciprocal of \( -\frac{1}{3} \), let's consider what the question entails and common misconceptions.

The reciprocal of a number \(x\) is \(\frac{1}{x}\). For a fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\), its reciprocal is \(\frac{b}{a}\). A common misconception might involve confusing the operation to find a reciprocal or misunderstanding the effect of negative signs.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the reciprocal of \( -\frac{1}{3} \). The reciprocal of \( -\frac{1}{3} \) is \( -3 \) because \( \frac{1}{-\frac{1}{3}} = -3 \).

## 2: Analyzing Possible Misconceptions
A common error could be forgetting to reverse the fraction or mishandling the negative sign. For example, some might think the reciprocal of \( -\frac{1}{3} \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \) (forgetting the negative sign), or \( -0.333... \) (which is essentially \( -\frac{1}{3} \), not its reciprocal).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic fraction concepts and negative numbers. They might choose \( D: \frac{1}{3} \) because they ignore the negative sign (20%), or \( B: -0.333... \) because they confuse it with the original fraction (30%). Some might incorrectly choose \( C: 3 \) (20%), and fewer would get it right with \( A: -3 \) (30%).
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a better grasp of fractions but might still make careless mistakes. They might choose \( A: -3 \) correctly (60%), \( D: \frac{1}{3} \) (20%), \( B: -0.333... \) (10%), and \( C: 3 \) (10%).
- **Proficient:** These students understand fractions and reciprocals well. They are likely to choose \( A: -3 \) correctly (80%), with minimal errors: \( D: \frac{1}{3} \) (10%), \( B: -0.333... \) (5%), and \( C: 3 \) (5%).
- **Advanced:** At this level, students not only understand the concepts but are also less likely to make simple mistakes. They would predominantly choose \( A: -3 \) correctly (95%), with very few errors: \( D: \frac{1}{3} \) (3%), \( B: -0.333... \) (1%), and \( C: 3 \) (1%).

## 4: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic:** A=60% B=10% C=10% D=20%
- **Proficient:** A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
- **Advanced:** A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
