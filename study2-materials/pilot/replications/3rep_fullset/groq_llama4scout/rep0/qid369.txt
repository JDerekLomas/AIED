To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with solving equations.

The equation given is:
\[
\frac{m}{6}-4=24
\]

Jo suggests:
\[
\frac{m}{6}=28
\]

Paul suggests:
\[
m-4=144
\]

## Step 1: Understanding Jo's Suggestion
Jo's step involves adding 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate the fraction. This is a valid algebraic step:
\[
\frac{m}{6}-4+4=24+4
\]
\[
\frac{m}{6}=28
\]
So, Jo is correct.

## 2: Understanding Paul's Suggestion
Paul's step involves multiplying every term by 6 to clear the denominator and then incorrectly adjusting the equation:
\[
\frac{m}{6} \times 6 - 4 \times 6 = 24 \times 6
\]
\[
m - 24 = 144
\]
To get Paul's equation:
\[
m - 4 = 144
\]
is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the multiplication of the entire equation by 6. The correct step after multiplying by 6 would give \(m - 24 = 144\), not \(m - 4 = 144\). So, Paul is incorrect.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
- A common misconception could be not understanding how to properly isolate a variable or incorrectly applying operations to both sides of an equation.
- Another could be misunderstanding how to handle fractions in equations.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly choose Paul's option due to a lack of understanding of how to isolate \(m\) or might not recognize Jo's step as correct. 
  - A (Only Jo) = 20%
  - B (Only Paul) = 40%
  - C (Both Jo and Paul) = 10%
  - D (Neither is correct) = 30%

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple mistakes. They are more likely to recognize Jo's correctness but might still be tricked by Paul's seemingly simple multiplication.
  - A = 50%
  - B = 25%
  - C = 10%
  - D = 15%

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebra and are less likely to fall for common misconceptions. They should easily see Jo's step as correct and Paul's as incorrect.
  - A = 80%
  - B = 5%
  - C = 5%
  - D = 10%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts easily. They will quickly identify Jo's correctness and Paul's incorrectness.
  - A = 95%
  - B = 0%
  - C = 0%
  - D = 5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
