To approach this question, let's first analyze the sequence and the nature of the patterns presented. The sequence starts with a rectangle made of 3 squares stacked vertically (Pattern 1), then adds 2 squares to the right of the bottom 2 squares to get Pattern 2, which has a total of 5 squares. For Pattern 3, 2 more squares are added in the same manner, resulting in a total of 7 squares. Finally, Pattern 4 adds another 2 squares, totaling 9 squares.

The key observation is that each step adds 2 squares to the pattern. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Pattern
The first pattern has 3 squares, the second has 5 squares (an increase of 2), the third has 7 squares (an increase of 2), and the fourth has 9 squares (an increase of 2). This indicates a linear sequence where each term increases by 2.

## 2: Identifying the Next Pattern
Following the established pattern, the next pattern (the fifth pattern) should have 9 + 2 = 11 squares.

## 3: Visualizing the Next Pattern
The visual representation provided in the options should match a rectangle with a base that increases by 1 square for each step (since the height remains constant at 2 squares for the rectangular part and 1 square is added on top) and then an additional square on top. The base width increases by 1 for each new pattern (3 squares wide for Pattern 1, 4 squares wide for Pattern 2, 5 squares wide for Pattern 3, and 6 squares wide for Pattern 4), so for Pattern 5, the rectangular part should be 6 squares wide and 2 squares high (totaling 12 squares), but considering the sequence and the typical addition, we focus on the provided choices.

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- A: A 4x2 rectangle with an extra square on top has 4*2 + 1 = 9 squares, which matches Pattern 4, not the next pattern.
- B: A 5x2 rectangle with an extra square on top has 5*2 + 1 = 11 squares, which fits the expected number for the next pattern in the sequence.
- C: A 5x2 rectangle with 2 extra squares on top has 5*2 + 2 = 12 squares, which is 1 more than expected.
- D: A 5x2 rectangle with an extra square on top and one more to the right has 5*2 + 1 + 1 = 13 squares, which does not fit.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle to understand the pattern or calculate the next step. They might choose based on visual cues rather than the sequence (A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%).
- **Basic:** Basic level students should be able to recognize the addition pattern. They might still make errors in counting or predicting the next step (A=20%, B=40%, C=25%, D=15%).
- **Proficient:** Proficient students should easily recognize the pattern and calculate the next step correctly. They are likely to choose B (A=10%, B=70%, C=10%, D=10%).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will not only recognize the pattern but also quickly and accurately calculate the next term. They are also likely to choose B, with an even higher confidence (A=5%, B=80%, C=5%, D=10%).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
