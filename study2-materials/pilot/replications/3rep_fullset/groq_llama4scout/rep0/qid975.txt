To approach this question, let's first understand what it's asking for: the ratio of blue, red, and purple counters based on their fractions of the total.

Given:
- Blue counters: \( \frac{1}{5} \)
- Red counters: \( \frac{3}{10} \)
- Purple counters: \( \frac{1}{2} \)

To compare these fractions directly, we need a common denominator, which in this case could be 10.

- Blue counters: \( \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{10} \)
- Red counters: \( \frac{3}{10} \) (no change)
- Purple counters: \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{10} \)

So, the ratio of blue : red : purple is \( \frac{2}{10} : \frac{3}{10} : \frac{5}{10} \), which simplifies to \( 2 : 3 : 5 \).

Let's analyze the options with this correct ratio in mind:

A: \( 2 : 3 : 5 \) - This matches our calculation.
B: \( 1 : 3 : 1 \) - Does not match.
C: \( 5 : 10 : 2 \) - Does not match.
D: \( 1 : 4 : 5 \) - Does not match.

Now, let's consider the likely performance of students at different ability levels:

### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with fractions and ratios. They might not easily convert fractions to have a common denominator or might confuse the ratios.

- A: \( 20\% \) (some might stumble upon the correct answer by chance or with incorrect calculations)
- B: \( 30\% \) (misconceptions about ratios or fractions might lead them here)
- C: \( 20\% \) (similar misconceptions)
- D: \( 30\% \) (another possible incorrect ratio)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of fractions and ratios but might still make errors in converting fractions or understanding ratios.

- A: \( 50\% \) (they have a chance to get it right if they correctly convert fractions)
- B: \( 25\% \) (less likely but still possible due to simple errors)
- C: \( 15\% \) (might seem plausible but is incorrect)
- D: \( 10\% \) (less likely)

### proficient
Students at this level are comfortable with fractions, ratios, and converting between them. They are likely to get it right.

- A: \( 80\% \) (most should be able to convert fractions to a common denominator and get the ratio)
- B: \( 5\% \) (unlikely to make a simple mistake)
- C: \( 5\% \) (similarly unlikely)
- D: \( 10\% \) (some might miscalculate or misunderstand)

### advanced
Students at this level have a deep understanding of ratios, fractions, and proportional relationships. They are very likely to get it right.

- A: \( 95\% \) (virtually all should understand and calculate the ratio correctly)
- B: \( 0\% \) (extremely unlikely to consider this)
- C: \( 0\% \) (similarly unlikely)
- D: \( 5\% \) (a small chance of miscalculation)

Given these considerations, here is the response in the requested format:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
