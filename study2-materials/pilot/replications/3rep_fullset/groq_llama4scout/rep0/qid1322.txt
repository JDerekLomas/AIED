## Step 1: Understand the question and the pie chart
The question provides a pie chart showing the favourite subjects of children at a school, divided into Mathematics, Science, English, and French, with 36 degrees for Science, 144 degrees for Mathematics, 72 degrees for English, and 108 degrees for French. We are told 12 students chose Science.

## 2: Calculate the total number of students
First, we need to find out the total number of students. Since Science is 36 degrees and represents 12 students, we can calculate the total number of students. A full circle is 360 degrees, so the fraction of the circle that Science represents is 36/360 = 1/10. If 1/10 of the students equals 12, then the total number of students is 12 * 10 = 120.

## 3: Determine the number of students who chose French
French is represented by 108 degrees. The fraction of the circle that French represents is 108/360 = 3/10. If the total number of students is 120, then the number of students who chose French is 3/10 * 120 = 36.

## 4: Analyze the potential for errors
The question might seem prone to errors if students misinterpret the proportions or fail to calculate the total number of students correctly. However, given that the numbers provided (like 12 students for Science) directly lead to simple calculations, the main challenge lies in accurately reading the pie chart and performing the calculations.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with reading the pie chart, understanding the relationship between degrees and student numbers, or calculating fractions of the total. They might choose an answer based on incorrect calculations or misunderstandings. Option A (36) seems directly calculable but let's assume some struggle: A=60% (guessing or incorrect calculation), B=20% (misreading the chart), C=10% (incorrect calculation), D=10% (another incorrect approach).
- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes or misunderstand the chart. They are likely to attempt calculations: A=80% (correct calculation), B=10% (simple mistake), C=5% (overcomplication), D=5% (error in calculation).
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with percentages, fractions, and can accurately read charts. They should easily calculate the correct answer: A=95% (accurate calculation), B=3% (minor mistake), C=1% (unlikely error), D=1% (calculation error).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them efficiently. They are likely to get the correct answer with ease: A=99% (straightforward calculation), B=0.5% (extremely rare mistake), C=0.25% (very unlikely error), D=0.25% (unlikely miscalculation).

## 6: Finalizing predictions
Given the calculations and analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **basic**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
- **advanced**: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%

The best answer is A.
