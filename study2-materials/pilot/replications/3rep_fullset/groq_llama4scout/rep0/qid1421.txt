## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks for the size of angle \( p \) in a triangle with angles labelled 49 degrees, 51 degrees, and \( p \), which is not to scale.

## 2: Recall the basic property of triangles
In any triangle, the sum of all interior angles is 180 degrees.

## 3: Analyze the potential for misconception
The potential misconception here could be that students might not recall or apply the rule that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Another misconception could be assuming the triangle is right-angled or isosceles based on the angle measurements given.

## 4: Consider the ease or difficulty of the question
Given that two angles are provided (49 degrees and 51 degrees), and the question is about finding the third angle, it seems straightforward. The calculation required is \( 180 - 49 - 51 = 80 \) degrees.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric principles or calculations. They might choose an answer that seems plausible but incorrect, such as A (\( 51^{\circ} \)), or think there's not enough information, D. The correct calculation seems within reach but requires attention to the question and recall of the triangle's angle sum.

- **Basic**: Students here should have a good grasp of basic geometry, including the sum of angles in a triangle. They might still make simple calculation errors or fall into common misconceptions. However, the straightforward nature of the question (with two angles given) should guide them towards the correct answer, C (\( 80^{\circ} \)).

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a solid understanding of geometry and be able to apply formulas and theorems correctly. They should easily calculate \( p = 180 - 49 - 51 = 80^{\circ} \) and choose C.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply their knowledge to more complex problems. For them, this question should be very straightforward, and they would likely choose C without hesitation.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple but incorrect option), B=10% (unlikely), C=30% (correct but might require effort), D=20% (not enough information, a common misconception).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=2%, B=1%, C=96%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=1%, B=0%, C=99%, D=0%.

## 7: Finalize predictions
Given the straightforward calculation and basic principle involved, most students, even at the basic level, should be able to get this right. The main errors will come from miscalculation or not applying the correct principle.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=0% C=99% D=0%
