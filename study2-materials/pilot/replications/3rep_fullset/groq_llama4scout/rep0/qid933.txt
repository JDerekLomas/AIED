## Step 1: Understand the question and the line equation
The equation of the line given is $y = 2x - 3$. To determine if a point lies on this line, we substitute the x-coordinate into the equation and check if the result equals the y-coordinate of the point.

## 2: Check Tom's point (5,7)
For Tom's point (5,7), we substitute $x = 5$ into the equation $y = 2x - 3$ to get $y = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7$. This confirms that (5,7) lies on the line.

## 3: Check Katie's point (-5,-7)
For Katie's point (-5,-7), we substitute $x = -5$ into the equation $y = 2x - 3$ to get $y = 2(-5) - 3 = -10 - 3 = -13$. This shows that (-5,-7) does not lie on the line.

## 4: Analyze the misconception and potential errors
A common misconception could be not checking the points properly or misinterpreting the equation. However, given the straightforward nature of substituting values into the equation, students who understand the basic concept of a linear equation should be able to correctly identify which points lie on the line.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting values into the equation or understanding what it means for a point to lie on a line. They might incorrectly assume both points are on the line or neither is, without proper calculation. Given the simplicity of the calculations, some might still get it right by chance or not attempt the calculation. Predicted percentages: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to perform the substitution but might make calculation errors. They are more likely to understand the concept of checking if a point satisfies an equation. Predicted percentages: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily substitute the values and understand the implications. They are likely to correctly identify Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect. Predicted percentages: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only correctly solve the problem but also understand that only one of the statements is true. They are likely to have a high accuracy rate. Predicted percentages: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%.

## 6: Adjust predictions based on question specifics
Given that the calculations are straightforward and the question directly tests understanding of linear equations, the predictions might lean towards higher accuracy rates, especially for proficient and advanced students.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
