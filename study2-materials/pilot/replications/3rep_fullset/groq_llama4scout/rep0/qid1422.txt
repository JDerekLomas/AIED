## Step 1: Understanding the equation and the task
The equation given is \( y = 8^x \), and we need to find \( y \) when \( x = \frac{1}{3} \). This means we are looking for \( 8^{\frac{1}{3}} \).

## 2: Analyzing the options with the equation
To solve \( 8^{\frac{1}{3}} \), we recall that \( 8 = 2^3 \). Therefore, \( 8^{\frac{1}{3}} = (2^3)^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2^{3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}} = 2^1 = 2 \).

## 3: Evaluating the answer choices
- A: \( \frac{8}{3} \) does not match our calculation.
- B: \( \sqrt{8} \) can be simplified to \( \sqrt{4 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2} \), which does not match.
- C: \( 2 \) matches our calculation.
- D: \( 24 \) does not match.

## 4: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand exponent rules or might incorrectly apply them. They might choose A or D due to misunderstanding the calculation or not knowing how to handle fractional exponents.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a basic understanding of exponents and roots. They might recognize \( 8^{\frac{1}{3}} \) as \( \sqrt[3]{8} \) and know \( \sqrt[3]{8} = 2 \), but could be distracted by other options.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily recognize \( 8^{\frac{1}{3}} = (2^3)^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2 \) and choose C.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will not only solve it correctly but might also quickly recognize the relationship between 8 and 2, directly choosing C.

## 5: Estimating percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (misapplication of rules), B=20% (confusion with square root), C=30% (correct but through luck or simple recognition), D=10% (completely off).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=25%, C=50%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 6: Converting estimates into the required format
Given the subjective nature of these estimates and the request for a precise format:
- below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
- basic: A=20% B=25% C=50% D=5%
- proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
