To approach this question, let's first understand what's being asked and the common misconceptions or errors students might make when solving quadratic equations.

The equation given is \(p^{2} - 16 = p\). To use the quadratic formula, the equation must be in the standard form of \(ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\). 

## Step 1: Identify the current form of the equation and the standard form.
The equation \(p^{2} - 16 = p\) needs to be rearranged into \(p^{2} - p - 16 = 0\) to fit the standard form.

## 2: Determine the step needed to rearrange the equation.
To rearrange \(p^{2} - 16 = p\) into the standard form, we need to get all terms on one side: \(p^{2} - p - 16 = 0\). This involves subtracting \(p\) from both sides of the equation.

## 3: Analyze the options given.
- A: Square root everything. This is incorrect because taking the square root of both sides is not the first step to rearrange the equation into standard form; it's a method to solve for \(p\) after the equation is squared.
- B: Add \(16\) to both sides. This would result in \(p^{2} = p + 16\), which is not the standard form.
- C: Divide everything by \(p\). This would change the equation significantly and is not necessary or correct for rearranging into standard form. It also assumes \(p \neq 0\).
- D: Subtract \(p\) from both sides. This directly leads to \(p^{2} - p - 16 = 0\), which is the standard form required for using the quadratic formula.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the requirements for the quadratic formula or might be confused by the steps to rearrange an equation. They might choose an option that seems like it could simplify the equation or might pick an option randomly. Option A (Square root everything) and C (Divide everything by \(p\)) could appeal to students who misunderstand equation solving. Option D is likely to be chosen by students who have some understanding of rearranging equations.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding of algebra and might recognize the need to isolate terms but could still make simple mistakes. They might choose B (Add \(16\) to both sides) as it seems like a simple step, or they might understand that subtracting \(p\) from both sides is correct.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to choose D (Subtract \(p\) from both sides) as they understand the need to rearrange the equation into the standard form for the quadratic formula.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will almost certainly choose D, as they not only understand the quadratic formula's requirements but can also rearrange equations efficiently.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level.
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (misunderstanding of equation solving), B=20% (simple addition seems like a solution), C=20% (incorrect operation), D=30% (some understanding of rearranging).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=30% (common simple mistake), C=10%, D=50% (understand the correct step).
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=10%, C=5%, D=80% (strong understanding of required steps).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=5%, C=0%, D=95% (clear understanding).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=10% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
