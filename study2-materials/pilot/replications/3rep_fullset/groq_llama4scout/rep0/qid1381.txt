## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to substitute given values into the equation \( s=u t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2} \) to find \( S \). The given values are \( a=4 \), \( u=3 \), and \( t=5 \).

## 2: Substituting Given Values
To find \( S \), we substitute \( a=4 \), \( u=3 \), and \( t=5 \) into the equation:
\[ S = 3 \times 5 + \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 5^{2} \]
\[ S = 15 + \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 25 \]
\[ S = 15 + \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \]
\[ S = 15 + 50 \]
\[ S = 65 \]

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
The equation \( s=u t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2} \) is a standard kinematic equation in physics, often tested in maths and physics classes. A common misconception might involve incorrect substitution or calculation, especially if students are not meticulous with their algebra or are prone to mistakes with order of operations.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and substitutions. They might incorrectly substitute values or perform calculations. Given the simplicity of the numbers, even they might manage to get the right answer if they follow the formula correctly, but errors in calculation are likely. Expect a significant spread across incorrect options due to calculation mistakes.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to follow the substitution and calculation process but might still make some errors due to carelessness or not following the order of operations correctly. They are more likely to choose the correct answer than those below basic but still might have a noticeable percentage choosing incorrect options.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to handle the substitution and calculation accurately. They should recognize the correct formula and apply it correctly. The chance of them choosing an incorrect option should be low.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are not only proficient but also have a deeper understanding. They should easily and accurately solve the problem, with a very high likelihood of choosing the correct answer.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation and the fact that the numbers do not particularly lend themselves to common misconceptions (like confusion with squares or fractions), most students, even those who are not advanced, should be able to get the correct answer with careful calculation.

- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40% (significant error rate expected)
- **Basic**: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80% (most get it right but some errors)
- **Proficient**: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95% (high accuracy expected)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100% (expect near-perfect accuracy)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
