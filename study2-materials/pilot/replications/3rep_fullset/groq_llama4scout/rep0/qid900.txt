To solve this, let's consider the conversion factors and the common misconceptions or difficulties students might have.

First, recall that \(1 \mathrm{~litre} = 1000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\) or \(1 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 0.001 \mathrm{~litres}\).

Given \(500000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\), to convert to litres, we divide by 1000 (since \(1000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 1 \mathrm{~litre}\)):

\(500000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 500000 / 1000 = 500 \mathrm{~litres}\).

So, the correct answer is C) \(500\).

Let's analyze the potential for error:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic conversion factors or not know how to convert between units. They might confuse the conversion factors or not understand the relationship between \(\mathrm{cm}^{3}\) and litres. Given the straightforward nature of the conversion in this question, a significant portion might still guess or choose randomly, but some might incorrectly apply a conversion factor or misunderstand the units.

  - A=30% (completely off, thinking it's a very small number), B=20% (thinking it's a bit more but not much), C=20% (actually getting it right or guessing correctly), D=30% (thinking it's a very large number).

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple errors. They know \(1 \mathrm{~litre} = 1000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\) but might struggle with large numbers or applying the conversion correctly.

  - A=5% (unlikely to think it's \(0.5\) litres), B=10% (might think it's \(5\) litres), C=70% (should get it right), D=15% (might overestimate).

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of conversions and can apply them accurately, even with large numbers.

  - A=0% (not likely to choose \(0.5\)), B=2% (unlikely to choose \(5\)), C=95% (should accurately convert), D=3% (might confuse but unlikely).

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the conversions but can also reason about units and large numbers effectively.

  - A=0% (impossible to choose \(0.5\)), B=0% (impossible to choose \(5\)), C=99% (will get it right), D=1% (might consider but quickly dismiss).

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
proficient: A=0% B=2% C=95% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%
