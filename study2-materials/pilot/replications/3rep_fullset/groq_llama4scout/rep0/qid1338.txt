To approach this question, let's break down the task and consider the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The question asks which fraction is closest to \( 1 \). The options provided are:
A: \( 1 \frac{1}{3} \)
B: \( \frac{9}{10} \)
C: \( \frac{4}{5} \)
D: \( 1 \frac{1}{7} \)

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task requires comparing each fraction to 1 and determining which one is closest. This involves converting mixed numbers to improper fractions or decimals for easier comparison, or directly comparing the fractions to 1.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \( 1 \frac{1}{3} \), is greater than 1. Specifically, it is \( 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \).

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( \frac{9}{10} \), is less than 1.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{4}{5} \), is also less than 1.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( 1 \frac{1}{7} \), is greater than 1 but close to it. It can be written as \( 1 + \frac{1}{7} = \frac{8}{7} \).

## 6: Comparison
- Option A (\( 1 \frac{1}{3} \)) is \( \frac{4}{3} \) or approximately 1.33.
- Option B (\( \frac{9}{10} \)) is 0.9.
- Option C (\( \frac{4}{5} \)) is 0.8.
- Option D (\( 1 \frac{1}{7} \)) is \( \frac{8}{7} \) or approximately 1.14.

## 7: Determining Closeness to 1
The distance from 1 for each option:
- A: \( |1.33 - 1| = 0.33 \)
- B: \( |0.9 - 1| = 0.1 \)
- C: \( |0.8 - 1| = 0.2 \)
- D: \( |1.14 - 1| = 0.14 \)

## 8: Conclusion on Closeness
Option B (\( \frac{9}{10} \)) with a distance of 0.1 is closest to 1.

## 9: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with converting mixed numbers to decimals or comparing fractions directly to 1. They might incorrectly choose A because it's a mixed number greater than 1, or they might not understand how to compare. 
  - A: 40% (intuitively larger than 1, might seem closest)
  - B: 20% (could recognize it's less than 1 but not sure how to compare)
  - C: 15% (similar to B, less than 1 but might not compare well)
  - D: 25% (also greater than 1, might seem close)

- **Basic**: Students here might start to understand fraction comparisons but could still make errors.
  - A: 20% (might recognize it's more than 1 but not calculate distance)
  - B: 30% (could see it's close to 1)
  - C: 20% (similar reasoning)
  - D: 30% (recognize it's close to 1)

- **Proficient**: These students should be able to convert and compare effectively.
  - A: 5% (should recognize it's further than B)
  - B: 50% (closest to 1)
  - C: 20% (might still consider but recognize it's not as close as B or D)
  - D: 25% (recognize it's close but not as close as B)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level should easily compare and calculate distances.
  - A: 0% (clearly not closest)
  - B: 80% (clearly closest)
  - C: 5% (not a likely choice given B and D)
  - D: 15% (while close, not as close as B)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=50% C=20% D=25%
advanced: A=0% B=80% C=5% D=15%
