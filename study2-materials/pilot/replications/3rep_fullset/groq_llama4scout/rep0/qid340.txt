## Step 1: Understand the question and the concept of reflection in the y-axis.
The question asks for the new coordinates of point \( P \) after the triangle is reflected in the \( y \)-axis. Reflecting a point in the \( y \)-axis involves changing the sign of the \( x \)-coordinate while keeping the \( y \)-coordinate the same.

## 2: Identify the coordinates of point \( P \) before reflection.
The coordinates of point \( P \) are given as \( (3, -1) \).

## 3: Calculate the new coordinates of point \( P \) after reflection in the \( y \)-axis.
To reflect point \( P \) in the \( y \)-axis, we change the sign of the \( x \)-coordinate. Thus, the new coordinates of \( P \) become \( (-3, -1) \).

## 4: Analyze the options given.
- A: \( (-3,-1) \)
- B: \( (0,-1) \)
- C: \( (-2,-1) \)
- D: \( (3,-1) \)

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic coordinate geometry. They might not understand the concept of reflection or might confuse it with translation or rotation. A common mistake could be changing both coordinates or not changing them at all. Option D \( (3,-1) \) seems like a plausible choice for students who don't understand the reflection concept, as it leaves the point unchanged. Option B \( (0,-1) \) might appeal to those who mistakenly think reflecting across the y-axis changes the x-coordinate to 0. So, below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic geometric transformations. They are likely to understand that reflection in the y-axis changes the sign of the x-coordinate. Thus, they should correctly choose A \( (-3,-1) \). However, some might still be confused, especially if they are not confident in their understanding. So, basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level have a solid understanding of geometric transformations and are less likely to make mistakes. They should accurately choose option A \( (-3,-1) \) as the correct answer. So, proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the transformation but can also apply it accurately and quickly. They are expected to choose option A \( (-3,-1) \) without any issues. So, advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
