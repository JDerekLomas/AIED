To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the misconceptions it aims to test.

The question revolves around the order of operations, specifically testing students' understanding of commutativity and associativity in addition and multiplication, as well as the correct application of the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## Step 1: Understanding Tom's Statement
Tom says: \(3+2-1 \equiv 3-1+2\). To assess if Tom is correct, we calculate both expressions:
- \(3+2-1 = 5 - 1 = 4\)
- \(3-1+2 = 2 + 2 = 4\)
Tom's statement is correct because both expressions equal 4, demonstrating the associative property of addition.

## 2: Understanding Katie's Statement
Katie says: \(3+2 \times 1 \equiv 2 \times 1+3\). Let's calculate both expressions:
- \(3+2 \times 1 = 3 + 2 = 5\)
- \(2 \times 1+3 = 2 + 3 = 5\)
Katie's statement is also correct because both expressions equal 5. This shows the commutative property of addition.

## 3: Analyzing the Statements for Misconceptions
The question aims to test if students recognize that both Tom and Katie are correct in their statements regarding the order of operations and properties of arithmetic. A common misconception could be not recognizing the commutative and associative properties of addition or incorrectly applying the order of operations.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and the order of operations. They might not fully understand or recognize the properties of arithmetic (commutative, associative). Therefore, they could mistakenly think only one or neither is correct. 
  - A=30% (some recognize Tom's simple addition correctly)
  - B=20% (some think Katie's involves multiplication but don't fully evaluate)
  - C=20% (a few might guess both are correct due to simple luck)
  - D=30% (some don't understand either statement)

- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of arithmetic but might still make errors in applying properties or order of operations.
  - A=20%
  - B=20%
  - C=40% (start to understand both are correct)
  - D=20%

- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations and basic properties.
  - A=10%
  - B=10%
  - C=70% (most see both statements are correct)
  - D=10%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can also apply and explain the concepts.
  - A=5%
  - B=5%
  - C=85% (very confident in both being correct)
  - D=5%

The best answer is below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
