To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option when multiplying the two terms indicated by the arrows in the expression \((x+5)(x-3)\), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with multiplying out brackets.

The terms indicated by the arrows are \(x\) and \(-3\). When these are multiplied, the result is \(-3x\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to multiply \(x\) by \(-3\), which should yield \(-3x\). This is a basic algebraic operation.

## 2: Common Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not applying the negative sign correctly or misunderstanding the distributive property. However, in this specific case, the question directly asks for the product of \(x\) and \(-3\), which is a straightforward calculation.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \(x + 3\) - Incorrect because it adds \(3\) instead of multiplying by \(-3\).
- B: \(+3x\) - Incorrect because it ignores the negative sign.
- C: \(x - 3\) - Incorrect because it subtracts \(3\) instead of multiplying by \(-3\).
- D: \(-3x\) - Correct, as it correctly multiplies \(x\) by \(-3\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with even basic algebraic operations. They might not understand how to multiply a variable by a constant or might ignore the negative sign. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, possibly with A, B, or C being chosen frequently due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make simple mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the operation needed but could easily choose B (\(+3x\)) because they forget to apply the negative sign.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic operations. They should easily identify the correct answer, \(-3x\), but a small percentage might still make careless errors, choosing B or another incorrect option.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their algebraic manipulations. They are less likely to make mistakes on simple operations like this.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the simplicity of the operation and assuming most students have a basic understanding of algebra:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple addition), B=30% (forgets negative sign), C=20% (subtraction error), D=10% (correct but challenging for this group).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=25%, C=10%, D=45%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=10%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=5%, C=0%, D=95%.

The best answer is D. 

So, here is the prediction in the requested format:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
