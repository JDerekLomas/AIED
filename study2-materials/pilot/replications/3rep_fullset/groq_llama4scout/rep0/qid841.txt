## Step 1: Analyzing the question and the spinners
The question presents two 6-sided spinners with the numbers 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, and 5 on each. The task is to determine how many cells in a sample space diagram would contain a score of 4 when the two spinners are spun and their scores are added together.

## 2: Identifying combinations that result in a score of 4
To achieve a score of 4, the possible combinations are: (1,3), (3,1), (3,3) is not valid since 3+3=6, and no other combinations sum to 4. Given the spinners, the number 1 appears once, and the number 3 appears twice.

## 3: Calculating the number of ways to achieve a score of 4
- For (1,3), there is 1 way to spin a 1 on the first spinner and 2 ways to spin a 3 on the second spinner, resulting in 1*2 = 2 combinations.
- For (3,1), there are 2 ways to spin a 3 on the first spinner and 1 way to spin a 1 on the second spinner, resulting in 2*1 = 2 combinations.

## 4: Summing the combinations for a score of 4
Adding these combinations together gives a total of 2 + 2 = 4 combinations that result in a score of 4.

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle to systematically list out all possible combinations or might not fully understand how to calculate the total number of outcomes. They might incorrectly assume all numbers have an equal chance or not account for the repeated numbers correctly. Therefore, they might choose D (0) because they see no obvious way to get a 4, or they might randomly guess. A=10%, B=15%, C=20%, D=55%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level can follow instructions but might need help with more complex calculations or understanding the implications of the spinner's layout. They could calculate the combinations but might make errors in counting or assume symmetry that doesn't exist. Thus, they might choose B (2) or C (4), but with some errors. A=5%, B=30%, C=50%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** These students can understand the question, identify the relevant combinations, and calculate them correctly. They should easily see that there are indeed 4 combinations that result in a score of 4. So, A=0%, B=5%, C=90%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the question but can also approach it with confidence and accuracy. They will quickly identify the correct answer without hesitation. Hence, A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 6: Converting predictions into the required format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=20% D=55%
- basic: A=5% B=30% C=50% D=15%
- proficient: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=20% D=55%
basic: A=5% B=30% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
