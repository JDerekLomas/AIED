To approach this question, let's first analyze what it's testing and the common misconceptions associated with solving equations and function machines.

The equation given is \( x^{2} + 5 = 14 \). To solve for \( x \), one would typically subtract 5 from both sides to get \( x^{2} = 9 \), and then take the square root of both sides to find \( x = \pm 3 \). 

The question asks which function machine will solve this equation, which means we're looking for a machine that takes \( x \) as input, applies some operations to get to \( x^{2} + 5 = 14 \), and then reverses those operations to solve for \( x \).

## Step 1: Understand the Correct Process
The correct sequence to solve \( x^{2} + 5 = 14 \) involves:
1. Subtracting 5 from both sides: \( x^{2} = 9 \)
2. Taking the square root: \( x = \pm 3 \)

## 2: Analyze Option A
Option A shows a function machine with \( x \) as input, then \( +5 \), then squaring to give 14 as output. The reverse function machine shows 14 as input, then square root, then \( -5 \). This option incorrectly suggests taking the square root before subtracting 5 in the reverse process.

## 3: Analyze Option B
Option B shows 14 as the input, then squaring and \( +5 \) to give the output. This doesn't directly relate to solving the equation for \( x \) as it doesn't start with \( x \) and apply the operations to get to 14.

## 4: Analyze Option C
Option C shows \( x \) as input, then squaring, then \( +5 \) to give 14 as output. The reverse function machine shows 14 as input, then \( -5 \), then square root. This correctly represents solving the equation: start with \( x \), square it, add 5 to get 14; reverse by taking 14, subtract 5 to get \( x^{2} \), then take the square root.

## 5: Analyze Option D
Option D suggests dividing by 2 after subtracting 5 in the reverse process, which is incorrect for solving \( x^{2} + 5 = 14 \).

## 6: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding function machines and algebraic manipulations. They might be inclined to choose an option that seems to directly relate to the numbers given (e.g., Option B, which directly involves 14 but doesn't solve for \( x \)). 
  - Below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still fall into common traps. They might choose Option A because it seems to involve key operations but misapply them.
  - Basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%

- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic manipulations and can likely see through incorrect options. They should recognize Option C as the correct method.
  - Proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the algebraic process but can also quickly identify the correct reversal of operations. They are likely to get it right.
  - Advanced: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%

Given these considerations:
