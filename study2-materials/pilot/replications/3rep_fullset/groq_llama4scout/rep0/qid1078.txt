To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 3000 \mathrm{~kg} \) is the same as \( ___ \) tonnes, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or understanding related to unit conversions, particularly between kilograms (kg) and tonnes.

## Step 1: Understanding the Conversion
First, recall that \( 1 \) tonne is equal to \( 1000 \) kilograms. Therefore, to convert kilograms to tonnes, one divides the number of kilograms by \( 1000 \).

## 2: Applying the Conversion
Applying this conversion to \( 3000 \mathrm{~kg} \): \( 3000 \div 1000 = 3 \) tonnes. This means the correct answer is \( 3 \) tonnes, which corresponds to option A.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve misunderstanding the relationship between kilograms and tonnes or making a calculation error. For instance, some might mistakenly multiply by \( 1000 \) instead of dividing, leading to \( 3000 \times 1000 = 3,000,000 \), which corresponds to option D. Others might not understand that \( 1 \) tonne equals \( 1000 \) kg and incorrectly choose based on a mistaken conversion factor.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic unit conversions. They could mistakenly think \( 3000 \mathrm{~kg} \) equals \( 3000 \) tonnes (not an option), or they might not understand the conversion and choose randomly. Given the options, they might lean towards larger numbers due to a lack of understanding, making B, C, or D plausible but incorrect choices. Let's predict: A=20% (some might guess correctly or have a basic understanding), B=30% (thinking it's 30 times something), C=20% (another incorrect conversion), D=30% (misunderstanding the conversion significantly).

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding and might remember that \( 1000 \) kg equals \( 1 \) tonne. However, they might make calculation errors. Let's predict: A=60% (correct calculation), B=20% (potential miscalculation), C=10% (less likely but possible error), D=10% (significant error).

- **Proficient:** These students are expected to understand and apply the conversion accurately. Let's predict: A=90% (accurate conversion), B=5% (minor error), C=3% (unlikely error), D=2% (rare significant error).

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong understanding and are less likely to make errors. Let's predict: A=98% (accurate conversion), B=1% (rare minor error), C=0.5% (very unlikely error), D=0.5% (extremely rare significant error).

## 5: Final Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic:** A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient:** A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
