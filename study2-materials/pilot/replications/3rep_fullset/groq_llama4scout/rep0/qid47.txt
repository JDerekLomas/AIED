## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to solve for \(\bigstar\) in the equation \(\frac{1}{3} \text { of } \bigstar = 27\). To solve for \(\bigstar\), students need to isolate \(\bigstar\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3, yielding \(\bigstar = 27 \times 3 = 81\).

## 2: Identifying the Correct Answer
The correct calculation leads to \(\bigstar = 81\), which corresponds to option C.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Errors
A common misconception might involve confusing the operation or misunderstanding the equation. For example, some students might incorrectly think the equation implies \(\bigstar = 27 \div 3 = 9\) (option B), or they might add or subtract instead of multiplying. However, the structure of this question is straightforward, asking directly for a multiplication to isolate the variable.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations or might not understand the concept of "of" in mathematical terms, leading them to randomly guess or apply incorrect operations. They might be tempted by option B (9) because it involves a simple division by 3, which they might mistakenly think applies. A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of fractions and basic algebra. They are likely to understand that to isolate \(\bigstar\), they need to multiply by 3. However, they might still make careless mistakes. Expect a high percentage to choose C, but some might opt for B due to confusion. A=5% B=20% C=65% D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts and are less likely to make simple errors. They should easily identify that \(\bigstar = 81\). A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the algebra but are also less prone to simple calculation errors. They should all correctly identify \(\bigstar = 81\). A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%.

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis, the predictions are as follows:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=65% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
