To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it might pose.

The question asks for the number that will be in the ones/units column of the final answer when multiplying 35 by 46. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task requires students to perform a multiplication of two numbers, 35 and 46, and then identify the digit in the ones place of the product.

## 2: Performing the Multiplication
To solve this, let's actually multiply 35 by 46:
\[ 35 \times 46 = 35 \times (40 + 6) \]
\[ = 35 \times 40 + 35 \times 6 \]
\[ = 1400 + 210 \]
\[ = 1610 \]

## 3: Identifying the Ones Digit
The ones digit of 1610 is 0.

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect multiplication or a misunderstanding of place value. However, this question specifically asks for the ones digit, which simplifies the task to just multiplying the ones digits of the two numbers (5 and 6) and looking at the ones digit of that product.

## 5: Multiplying Ones Digits
The ones digit of \(5 \times 6 = 30\) is 0.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts. They might not correctly multiply 5 and 6 or understand the concept of the ones place. 
  - A=60% (incorrect but simplistic answer, might think it's about adding or something very basic)
  - B=10% (random guess)
  - C=20% (might recall that 5*6 ends in 0, but not apply it correctly)
  - D=10% (might think in terms of the full multiplication result rather than just the ones digit)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic multiplication facts but might make careless mistakes.
  - A=80% (correctly identify the ones digit as 0)
  - B=5% (random guess)
  - C=10% (might confuse with another digit)
  - D=5% (unlikely to consider the full product in this context)

- **Proficient**: Students at this level are confident in their multiplication skills and understand place value.
  - A=95% (confidently identify the ones digit as 0)
  - B=2% (unlikely guess)
  - C=2% (might be a very careless mistake)
  - D=1% (understanding but misapplication is rare)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply it with ease.
  - A=99% (easily identify the ones digit as 0)
  - B=0.5% (very unlikely guess)
  - C=0.5% (extremely rare mistake)
  - D=0% (fully understand the question and its requirements)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.5% D=0%
