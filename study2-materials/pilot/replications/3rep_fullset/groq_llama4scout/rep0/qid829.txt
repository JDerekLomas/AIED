## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for the given question about multiplying out brackets: \((m-3)(m-2)\).

## 2: Identify the correct answer
First, let's find the correct answer by multiplying out the brackets:
\((m-3)(m-2) = m(m) + m(-2) - 3(m) - 3(-2)\)
\(= m^2 - 2m - 3m + 6\)
\(= m^2 - 5m + 6\).
So, the correct answer is A) \(m^2 - 5m + 6\).

## 3: Analyze common misconceptions
A common misconception when expanding brackets like \((m-3)(m-2)\) is to incorrectly apply the signs or to add/subtract the terms inside the brackets instead of multiplying them out properly. For instance, some students might mistakenly calculate it as \(m^2 - 3m - 2m - 6 = m^2 - 5m - 6\), which corresponds to option D.

## 4: Consider the difficulty level for each option
- Option A is the correct expansion.
- Option B (\(m^2 - m - 6\)) might result from incorrect handling of terms, possibly adding or subtracting incorrectly.
- Option C (\(m^2 + 5m + 6\)) seems unlikely as it would involve incorrectly adding the constants and the \(m\) terms.
- Option D (\(m^2 - 5m - 6\)) could result from a common error of subtracting the product of the constants instead of adding them.

## 5: Assess student performance by ability level
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with the algebra, potentially leading to random or incorrect choices. Given the simplicity of the options, they might be more likely to choose D due to a simple subtraction error (\(m^2 - 5m - 6\)).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding but might still struggle with signs and operations. They are more likely to choose A but could be tempted by D due to the mistake in handling the constant term.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students generally understand algebraic expansion well but might occasionally make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose A.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of algebraic concepts and are less likely to make mistakes. They should predominantly choose A.

## 6: Estimate percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below_basic**: A=40% (some get it right by chance or basic understanding), B=20% (confused operations), C=10% (unlikely but possible through significant confusion), D=30% (common mistake).
- **Basic**: A=60% (most understand but might make simple errors), B=15% (occasional confusion), C=5% (less likely), D=20% (common error attracts some).
- **Proficient**: A=85% (strong understanding), B=5% (minimal confusion), C=2% (rare mistake), D=8% (occasional error).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (excellent understanding), B=2% (rare careless mistake), C=1% (extremely rare), D=2% (very rare).

## 7: Format the response
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
