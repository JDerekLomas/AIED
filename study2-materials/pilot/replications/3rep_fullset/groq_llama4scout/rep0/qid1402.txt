## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question asks students to interpret an algebraic expression \(3 + ab\) and choose the correct statement that describes it. The statements involve different operations and orders of operations.

## 2: Analyze Option A
Option A states, "Add \(3\) to \(a\) multiplied by \(b\)." This directly corresponds to the algebraic expression \(3 + ab\), as it implies that \(a\) is multiplied by \(b\) and then \(3\) is added to the result.

## 3: Analyze Option B
Option B states, "Add \(a\) and \(b\) then add three." This would be represented algebraically as \(a + b + 3\), which does not match the given expression \(3 + ab\).

## 4: Analyze Option C
Option C states, "Add three to \(a\) and then multiply by \(b\)." This translates to \(b(a + 3)\) or \(ab + 3b\), which is not equivalent to \(3 + ab\).

## 5: Analyze Option D
Option D states, "Add three to \(b\) and then multiply by \(a\)." This translates to \(a(b + 3)\) or \(ab + 3a\), which also does not match \(3 + ab\).

## 6: Consider Student Understanding
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding algebraic expressions and the order of operations. They might mistakenly think that addition and multiplication can be performed in any order or might misinterpret the expression. Option B might appeal to those who think \(a\) and \(b\) should be added first (B = 40%), and Option C or D might attract those who misunderstand the order of operations (C = 30%, D = 20%). Option A, being the correct interpretation, might be chosen by only 10%.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and order of operations. They are more likely to recognize that \(ab\) means \(a \times b\), but might still struggle with the correct interpretation of adding 3 to the product. Option A should be more recognizable as correct (A = 60%), with fewer choosing B, C, or D (B = 20%, C = 10%, D = 10%).

- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand algebraic expressions well and are familiar with the conventions of algebra. They should easily recognize \(3 + ab\) as "add \(3\) to \(a\) multiplied by \(b\)". Thus, Option A should be chosen by a high percentage (A = 80%), with minimal choices for the incorrect options (B = 5%, C = 5%, D = 10%).

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand algebraic expressions but also can manipulate them with ease. They should have no trouble with this question. The correct answer, Option A, should be chosen by virtually all (A = 90%), with very few, if any, choosing the incorrect options (B = 2%, C = 2%, D = 6%).

## 7: Assign Percentages
Based on the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A = 10%, B = 40%, C = 30%, D = 20%
- **Basic**: A = 60%, B = 20%, C = 10%, D = 10%
- **Proficient**: A = 80%, B = 5%, C = 5%, D = 10%
- **Advanced**: A = 90%, B = 2%, C = 2%, D = 6%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=2% D=6%
