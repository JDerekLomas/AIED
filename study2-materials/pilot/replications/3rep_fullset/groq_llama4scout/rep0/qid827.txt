To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Jo and Paul and evaluate their validity.

Jo claims you can never simplify a fraction if either the numerator or denominator is a prime number. This statement is not accurate. A simple counterexample is the fraction 2/4, where 2 is prime. This fraction can be simplified to 1/2. Therefore, Jo's statement is incorrect.

Paul claims you will always be able to simplify a fraction if neither the numerator nor the denominator is prime. This statement is also not accurate. A counterexample is the fraction 6/9, where neither 6 nor 9 is a prime number (6 = 2*3 and 9 = 3*3), but the fraction can be simplified to 2/3. However, not all fractions where neither the numerator nor denominator is prime can be simplified (e.g., 8/9). But more crucially, Paul's statement implies that if a fraction's numerator and denominator are both non-prime, it can always be simplified, which isn't necessarily true. A fraction like 4/9 (where 4 = 2^2 and 9 = 3^2) cannot be simplified further because 4 and 9 share no common factors other than 1.

Given these analyses:
- Jo is incorrect because having a prime number in a fraction does not preclude simplification (e.g., 2/4).
- Paul is incorrect because having neither a prime numerator nor denominator does not guarantee that the fraction can be simplified.

The correct answer is D) Neither is correct.

Now, let's consider the likely responses based on student ability levels:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may struggle with understanding prime numbers, simplifying fractions, and evaluating logical statements about mathematical operations. They may not fully grasp the definitions or the implications of prime numbers in fractions. 
  - A (Only Jo) = 30% (some might buy into Jo's seemingly logical but flawed statement)
  - B (Only Paul) = 20% (others might think Paul's has a logical basis)
  - C (Both Jo and Paul) = 10% (a few might mistakenly agree with both)
  - D (Neither is correct) = 40% (but some might realize both are incorrect)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of fractions and prime numbers but might still fall for misconceptions or struggle with abstract reasoning.
  - A = 20%
  - B = 15%
  - C = 5%
  - D = 60%

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid understanding of fractions and prime numbers. They are likely to see through both Jo's and Paul's arguments.
  - A = 10%
  - B = 5%
  - C = 5%
  - D = 80%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also reason abstractly and provide logical counterexamples.
  - A = 0% (or close)
  - B = 0% (or close)
  - C = 0% (or close)
  - D = 100% (or very close)

Given these considerations, here's a formatted prediction:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=5% D=60%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
