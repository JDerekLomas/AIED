## Step 1: Understand the question and the diagram
The question provides a diagram showing angles around a point made up of two angles labelled: \(f\) and \(f-20\). The task is to determine which of the given equations is true based on this diagram.

## 2: Recall the relevant geometric principle
The key principle here is that the sum of angles around a point is \(360^\circ\). Given the two angles are \(f\) and \(f-20\), their sum should equal \(360^\circ\). So, the correct equation based on this principle is \(f + (f - 20) = 360\).

## 3: Solve the equation for verification
Solving \(f + (f - 20) = 360\), we get:
\[2f - 20 = 360\]
This matches option A: \(2f - 20 = 360\).

## 4: Analyze each option
- Option A: \(2f - 20 = 360\), which we've verified as correct.
- Option B: \(2f - 20 = 180\), suggesting the angles sum to \(180^\circ\), which is incorrect for angles around a point.
- Option C: \(f^2 - 20 = 360\), which does not relate to the sum of angles around a point.
- Option D: \(f - 20 = f\), which simplifies to \(-20 = 0\), clearly incorrect.

## 5: Consider student misconceptions and difficulties
Students might struggle with:
- Understanding that angles around a point sum to \(360^\circ\).
- Setting up the equation based on the diagram.
- Distinguishing between correct and incorrect equations.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students may not understand that angles around a point add up to \(360^\circ\) or may struggle with algebraic expressions. They might choose B or C due to misunderstanding the concept or the equation. A=20%, B=40%, C=30%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students should have a basic understanding of angles around a point but might make algebraic mistakes. They are likely to choose A but might be tempted by B. A=60%, B=30%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: Students should easily identify the correct equation and distinguish it from incorrect ones. A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: These students should not only identify the correct equation but also quickly dismiss incorrect options. A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

## 7: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
