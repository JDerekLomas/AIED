To approach this, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The expression given is \( p^{2} - 4 \). This is a difference of squares, which can be factorized into \( (p - 2)(p + 2) \). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept
The concept here is the difference of squares, which is \( a^{2} - b^{2} = (a - b)(a + b) \). Applying this to \( p^{2} - 4 \), we see \( a = p \) and \( b = 2 \), so \( p^{2} - 4 = (p - 2)(p + 2) \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be not recognizing the expression as a difference of squares or incorrectly applying factorization techniques. For example, some might incorrectly factor it as \( p(p - 2) \) (option B), which is actually the factorization of \( p^{2} - 2p \), not \( p^{2} - 4 \). Another error could be thinking it's a perfect square trinomial and trying to factor it as \( (p - 2)(p - 2) \) (option C), which would be correct for \( p^{2} - 4p + 4 \), not \( p^{2} - 4 \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( (p - 2)(p + 2) \) is the correct factorization.
- Option B: \( p(p - 2) \) is incorrect for \( p^{2} - 4 \) but could be a plausible mistake.
- Option C: \( (p - 2)(p - 2) \) is incorrect and represents a specific type of error.
- Option D: "Does not factorise" is incorrect because \( p^{2} - 4 \) can be factorized.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not recognize the difference of squares (A=20%, B=30%, C=20%, D=30%).
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might not consistently apply formulas. They are likely to make errors like B or C (A=50%, B=25%, C=15%, D=10%).
- **Proficient:** These students are familiar with algebraic identities, including the difference of squares. They are likely to get it right but might have a small chance of making a careless error (A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are confident and familiar with the concepts. They are likely to almost always get it right (A=95%, B=2%, C=1%, D=2%).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
