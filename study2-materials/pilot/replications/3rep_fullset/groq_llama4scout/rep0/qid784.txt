To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing: the factorization of a difference of squares. The expression \(x^{2} - 64\) can be seen as a difference of squares since \(64 = 8^{2}\). The correct factorization, using the formula \(a^{2} - b^{2} = (a + b)(a - b)\), is \((x + 8)(x - 8)\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
- A common misconception might be to factor out an \(x\), resulting in \(x(x - 64)\), which is option B. Another might be to incorrectly apply the difference of squares formula or not recognize \(x^{2} - 64\) as a difference of squares.
- Option D, \((x - 8)(x - 8)\), suggests a misconception where the student thinks \(x^{2} - 64\) is a perfect square trinomial.

## 2: Evaluating Option A
Option A, \((x + 8)(x - 8)\), is the correct factorization of \(x^{2} - 64\). Students who are familiar with the difference of squares formula should easily recognize this.

## 3: Assessing Difficulty and Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with recognizing \(x^{2} - 64\) as a difference of squares. They might choose B because they see an \(x\) and think of factoring out \(x\), or they might not understand the concept of difference of squares. Thus, B might be a popular incorrect choice. A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of algebra but might still make errors in applying formulas. They should recognize the difference of squares, but careless mistakes could lead to choosing D. So, A=70%, B=20%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** Students here should confidently apply the difference of squares formula. The incorrect options might attract a few due to oversight or rushing. Hence, A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** These students are expected to not only know the formula but also apply it accurately without hesitation. The chance of selecting an incorrect option is minimal. Therefore, A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

## 4: Conclusion
Given the analysis, here's the predicted percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
