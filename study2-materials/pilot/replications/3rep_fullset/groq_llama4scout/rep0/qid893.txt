To approach this question, let's consider the conversions involved and the potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

First, we need to convert kilograms and grams into tonnes. Recall that \(1 \, \text{tonne} = 1000 \, \text{kilograms}\) and \(1 \, \text{kilogram} = 1000 \, \text{grams}\).

Given: \(5\) kilograms and \(7\) grams.

1. Convert \(5\) kilograms to tonnes: \(5 \, \text{kg} = 0.005 \, \text{tonnes}\) (since \(1000 \, \text{kg} = 1 \, \text{tonne}\)).
2. Convert \(7\) grams to tonnes: \(7 \, \text{grams} = 0.007 \, \text{kg} = 0.000007 \, \text{tonnes}\) (since \(1000 \, \text{grams} = 1 \, \text{kg}\) and \(1000 \, \text{kg} = 1 \, \text{tonne}\)).

Adding these together: \(0.005 + 0.000007 = 0.005007 \, \text{tonnes}\).

So, the correct answer is \(0.005007 \, \text{tonnes}\) or \(0.005007 t\), which corresponds to option D.

Now, let's consider the potential errors and the performance of students at different ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with unit conversions and adding decimals. They might incorrectly convert kilograms to tonnes or not accurately add the values. Given the complexity of converting grams to tonnes directly, these students might opt for A or C, not understanding the conversion factors properly. 
  - A: 20% (direct but incorrect conversion)
  - B: 10% (might seem plausible but requires accurate conversion)
  - C: 30% (plausible for those who convert kg to tonnes correctly but struggle with grams)
  - D: 40% (correct but might be challenging due to conversion difficulties)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of conversions but might still make errors, especially with the conversion of grams to tonnes. They are more likely to recognize the conversion factors but might make calculation errors.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 15% (might confuse conversion steps)
  - C: 25%
  - D: 50%

- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with conversions and should accurately convert both kilograms and grams to tonnes. However, they might still make minor calculation errors.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 15%
  - D: 70%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong understanding of unit conversions and are less likely to make errors. They should easily convert and compute the correct answer.
  - A: 1%
  - B: 2%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 92%

Given the above analysis:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=25% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=5% D=92%
