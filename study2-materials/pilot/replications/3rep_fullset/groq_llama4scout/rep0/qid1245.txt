## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula provided
The question provides a trapezium with parallel sides labeled as \(x - 1\) and \(x + 3\), and the height labeled as \(x\). The area of the trapezium is given as \(12 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\). The formula for the area of a trapezium is \(\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \(h\) is the height. Substituting the given values, we get \(\frac{1}{2} \times (x - 1 + x + 3) \times x = 12\), which simplifies to \(\frac{1}{2} \times (2x + 2) \times x = 12\), and further to \((x + 1)x = 12\), resulting in \(x^{2} + x - 12 = 0\). Adam writes the formula as \(x^{2} + x = 12\), which is close but not exactly what we derived. However, to solve the given equation \(x^{2} + x = 12\), we rearrange it to \(x^{2} + x - 12 = 0\).

## 2: Solve the quadratic equation
To solve \(x^{2} + x - 12 = 0\), we can factor it into \((x + 4)(x - 3) = 0\). This gives us two solutions: \(x = -4\) and \(x = 3\).

## 3: Analyze the solutions in the context of the question
Given that the solutions to the equation are \(x = -4\) and \(x = 3\), we can now look at the answer choices provided:
- A: \(x = 4\) and \(x = 3\)
- B: \(x = -4\) and \(x = -3\)
- C: \(x = 4\) and \(x = -3\)
- D: \(x = -4\) and \(x = 3\)

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with solving quadratic equations or understanding the context. They might not correctly solve \(x^{2} + x - 12 = 0\) or might not understand how to apply the quadratic formula or factorization. Given the mistake in Adam's formula, they might be more prone to errors. They could choose any option incorrectly, but let's assume they have a higher chance of picking an option that seems plausible or matches a common error pattern. Option D seems correct based on our calculation, but students here might not reach it. A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
- **Basic**: Students at this level can solve simple quadratic equations but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to solve the equation correctly but might be distracted by the context or Adam's error. They have a good chance of getting the correct answer. A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
- **Proficient**: These students can confidently solve quadratic equations and understand the context. They are less likely to make simple algebraic mistakes. Given that we've derived \(x = -4\) and \(x = 3\) as solutions, they should easily identify the correct answer. A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only solve equations easily but also understand the implications of negative lengths in the context of the problem. They might question the validity of \(x = -4\) given that lengths cannot be negative. However, mathematically, \(x = -4\) is a solution. A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
