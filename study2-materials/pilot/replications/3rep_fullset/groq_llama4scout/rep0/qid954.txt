To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 4514 - 328 = \), let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions or errors students might make.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to perform a simple subtraction: \( 4514 - 328 \). This operation does not inherently suggest a common misconception like those seen in multiplication or division problems (e.g., incorrect handling of negative numbers, misplacing decimal points), but it does involve borrowing in subtraction.

## 2: Common Errors in Subtraction
A common error in subtraction, especially when borrowing is required, is incorrect handling of the borrow. However, in this case, since 328 is less than 4514, and the subtraction does not require borrowing across multiple digits (just a simple subtraction where borrowing might be necessary from the thousands place), the calculation is straightforward: \( 4514 - 300 = 4214 \) and then \( 4214 - 28 = 4186 \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( 4196 \) seems plausible if one makes a calculation mistake.
- B: \( 1234 \) seems highly unlikely as it suggests a miscalculation far beyond simple arithmetic errors.
- C: \( 4214 \) could be an answer if someone subtracts 300 but forgets to subtract 28.
- D: \( 4186 \) is the correct answer.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations. They might choose B (due to not understanding the operation or making a large error), C (if they partially complete the subtraction), or A/D if they attempt but make a small mistake. Given the simplicity needed for below basic, B=30% (large error), C=40% (partially correct), A=20%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** Basic level students should be able to perform simple subtractions. However, they might still make careless errors. So, A=20% (small mistake), B=5% (unlikely but possible if extremely careless), C=15% (partially correct), D=60%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to accurately perform such calculations. Thus, A=10% (minor error), B=1% (very unlikely), C=5% (occasional lapse), D=84%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are highly likely to get this correct. So, A=5%, B=0%, C=2%, D=93%.

## 5: Formatting the Predictions
Given these considerations, here are the predictions in the requested format:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=5% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=10% B=1% C=5% D=84%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=2% D=93%
