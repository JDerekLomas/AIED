To solve this, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie in relation to the equation \(x = y - 4\).

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Statement
Tom says \(2x > y - 4\) is always true. Let's substitute \(x\) from the given equation \(x = y - 4\) into Tom's statement.
\[2(y - 4) > y - 4\]
\[2y - 8 > y - 4\]
\[2y - y > -4 + 8\]
\[y > 4\]
So, Tom's statement is not always true; it depends on the value of \(y\). If \(y \leq 4\), Tom's statement is false.

## 2: Analyze Katie's Statement
Katie says \(x > y - 5\) is always true. Substituting \(x = y - 4\) into Katie's statement:
\[y - 4 > y - 5\]
\[-4 > -5\]
This statement is always true because \(-4\) is indeed greater than \(-5\), regardless of \(y\).

## 3: Determine the Correctness of Statements
- Tom's statement is not always true; it requires \(y > 4\).
- Katie's statement is always true.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
Given the equation and the statements:
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle to substitute and simplify. They might not fully understand the concept of "always true" in the context of algebraic manipulation. Tom: 30% (misunderstanding substitution), Katie: 20% (simple comparison error), Both: 10% (guessing), Neither: 40% (not understanding either statement).
- **Basic**: Students can perform basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. Tom: 20% (understanding but misapplying), Katie: 40% (recognizing the simple inequality), Both: 5% (error in detailed checking), Neither: 35% (some understanding but flawed application).
- **Proficient**: Students can analyze and apply algebraic concepts well. Tom: 10% (seeing through the direct substitution), Katie: 60% (clearly understanding the comparison), Both: 5% (misjudging Tom's statement), Neither: 25% (solid understanding but might question Katie's universality).
- **Advanced**: Students can critically evaluate statements. Tom: 5% (quickly identifying conditions), Katie: 70% (clear understanding of algebraic relationships), Both: 0% (precise in evaluation), Neither: 25% (deep understanding, recognizing both statements' validity conditions).

The best answer is below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=5% B=70% C=0% D=25%
