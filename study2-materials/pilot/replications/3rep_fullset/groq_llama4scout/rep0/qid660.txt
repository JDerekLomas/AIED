To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about finding the gradient of a line given its equation \(5x + 3y = 7\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task requires students to rearrange the equation of a line into the slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the gradient (or slope) of the line. The given equation is \(5x + 3y = 7\). To find the gradient, students need to solve for \(y\).

## 2: Rearranging the Equation
Rearrange the equation to solve for \(y\):
\[3y = -5x + 7\]
\[y = -\frac{5}{3}x + \frac{7}{3}\]
Thus, the gradient (\(m\)) of the line is \(-\frac{5}{3}\).

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception is confusing the coefficients of \(x\) and \(y\) when converting to slope-intercept form. Students might mistakenly think the gradient is the coefficient of \(x\) or \(y\) without properly rearranging the equation.

## 4: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \(\frac{3}{5}\) might be chosen by students who mistakenly rearrange the equation incorrectly or confuse the formula.
- Option B: \(-5\) could be a guess or a misinterpretation.
- Option C: \(5\) seems unlikely as it's not directly related to the coefficients in a manner that suggests a simple mistake.
- Option D: \(-\frac{5}{3}\) is the correct gradient.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not even attempt to rearrange the equation properly. They might guess or choose an option based on the signs or values of the coefficients without calculation. Expect a high percentage of incorrect choices, possibly with A and B being popular due to their simplicity.
- **Basic**: Students here might attempt to solve but could easily fall into common traps. They might choose A (\(\frac{3}{5}\)) because it directly relates to the coefficients but in a reversed manner, or they might not solve it correctly.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to correctly rearrange the equation and identify the gradient as \(-\frac{5}{3}\). However, some might still make careless mistakes, potentially choosing A or B.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong understanding and rarely make mistakes. They should overwhelmingly choose D.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple, direct relation), B=30% (error in sign or coefficient), C=10% (random guess), D=20% (some might get it right by chance or have a good intuition).
- **Basic**: A=30% (misconception), B=20% (simple error), C=10% (guess), D=40% (correct, but not as confident).
- **Proficient**: A=15% (careless mistake), B=10% (simple error), C=5% (guess), D=70% (correct).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (rare mistake), B=5% (rare error), C=0% (unlikely guess), D=90% (correct, confident).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=15% B=10% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
