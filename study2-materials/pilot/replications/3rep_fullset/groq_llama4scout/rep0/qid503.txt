To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might encounter.

The question presents an equation: \(4p + 5 = 2p - 9\), and three steps to solve it:
1. Step A: \(4p = 2p - 4\)
2. Step B: \(2p = -4\)
3. Step C: \(p = -2\)

Let's evaluate the correctness of each step:
- The original equation is \(4p + 5 = 2p - 9\).
- Subtracting \(2p\) from both sides gives \(2p + 5 = -9\).
- Subtracting 5 from both sides gives \(2p = -14\).
- Dividing both sides by 2 gives \(p = -7\).

So, the correct steps should be:
1. \(4p + 5 = 2p - 9\)
2. \(2p + 5 = -9\) (not shown but implied as the first step)
3. \(2p = -14\) (not shown but implied as the second step)
4. \(p = -7\) (not shown)

Given steps:
- Step A: \(4p = 2p - 4\) is incorrect because it was derived without properly accounting for the \(+5\) on the left side and \(-9\) on the right side. The correct derivation from \(4p + 5 = 2p - 9\) would involve subtracting \(2p\) and then \(5\) from both sides properly.

## Step 1: Evaluate Step A
Step A seems to have been derived by subtracting \(2p\) from both sides (\(4p - 2p + 5 = 2p - 2p - 9\)) which simplifies to \(2p + 5 = -9\), and then it mistakenly shows \(4p = 2p - 4\), which does not follow from correct algebra. The error here suggests a misunderstanding of algebraic manipulation.

## 2: Evaluate Step B and C
- Step B: \(2p = -4\) seems to follow from an incorrect step A, as if \(2p + 5 = -9\) was mistakenly reduced.
- Step C: \(p = -2\) directly follows from Step B.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors
The key error in this solution path is in Step A, where the algebraic manipulation is incorrect. 

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students here might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not even attempt to solve it or could mistakenly think all steps are correct due to a lack of understanding. 
  - \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 60\%\)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have some understanding but may make careless mistakes. They are likely to spot that Step A is incorrect but might struggle with precise algebraic manipulations.
  - \(A = 60\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 15\%\)

- **Proficient:** These students understand algebraic manipulations well and should easily identify Step A as incorrect.
  - \(A = 80\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 10\%\)

- **Advanced:** Students here not only understand algebra but are also meticulous. They will quickly identify the mistake in Step A.
  - \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 2\%\), \(C = 2\%\), \(D = 6\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=2% D=6%
