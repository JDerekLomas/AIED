## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question requires students to calculate the area of a compound shape (an L shape) using different methods provided by Paige, Kaci, and David, and then determine who is correct.

## 2: Analyze the Shape
The L shape has a full width of 9m at the bottom and a partial width of 5m at the top. The full height on the left is 10m, and the partial height on the right is 6m. This implies the missing width at the top is 4m (9m - 5m = 4m) and the missing height on the right is 4m (10m - 6m = 4m).

## 3: Calculate the Area of the L Shape
To verify the correct method, we calculate the total area by dividing the L shape into two rectangles: one with dimensions 5m x 10m and the other with dimensions 4m x 6m. The total area = (5 x 10) + (4 x 6) = 50 + 24 = 74m^2.

## 4: Evaluate Paige's Method
Paige's method: \(10 \times 6 + 5 \times 4 = 60 + 20 = 80m^2\). This is incorrect based on our calculation.

## 5: Evaluate Kaci's Method
Kaci's method: \(10 \times 5 + 9 \times 6 = 50 + 54 = 104m^2\). This is also incorrect.

## 6: Evaluate David's Method
David's method: \(9 \times 10 - 6 \times 4 = 90 - 24 = 66m^2\). This is incorrect as well.

## 7: Consider the Correct Approach
The correct approach to find the area is to calculate it as two separate rectangles: \(5 \times 10 + 4 \times 6 = 50 + 24 = 74m^2\), or alternatively, \(9 \times 6 + 5 \times 4 = 54 + 20 = 74m^2\), which was not listed but helps to understand that none of the provided calculations match the correct area.

## 8: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand the question or calculate areas. They might randomly select an option or choose based on incorrect interpretations. Given the complexity, A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic area calculations but might not carefully analyze each option. They could make simple arithmetic errors. A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%.
- **Proficient**: These students can calculate areas and are more likely to spot incorrect methods. They might still make errors if they misinterpret the dimensions or calculations. A=20% B=20% C=25% D=35%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to carefully calculate or reason through each option. They should quickly identify that none of the provided calculations (A, B, C) matches the correct area, making D unlikely. A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%.

## 9: Adjust for Realistic Expectations
Given that the question asks for a prediction of percentages and considering typical student performance:
- Below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- Basic: A=15% B=15% C=40% D=30%
- Proficient: A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%
- Advanced: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=40% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
