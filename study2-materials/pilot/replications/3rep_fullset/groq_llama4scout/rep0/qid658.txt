To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and evaluate their correctness based on the given functions: $y=x^{2} - 4$ and $y=x-4$.

## Step 1: Evaluate Tom's Statement
Tom says both functions are linear. A linear function has the form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. The first function, $y=x^{2} - 4$, is a quadratic function because it contains an $x^2$ term, making it non-linear. The second function, $y=x-4$, is linear. Therefore, Tom is incorrect because only one of the functions is linear.

## 2: Evaluate Katie's Statement
Katie says both functions cross the $y$-axis at the same point. To find where each function crosses the $y$-axis, we set $x=0$ for both functions. For $y=x^{2} - 4$, when $x=0$, $y=0^{2} - 4 = -4$. For $y=x-4$, when $x=0$, $y=0-4 = -4$. Since both functions cross the $y$-axis at $y=-4$, Katie is correct.

## 3: Determine the Correctness of Each Statement
- Tom is incorrect because $y=x^{2} - 4$ is not linear.
- Katie is correct because both functions do cross the $y$-axis at the same point, $(0, -4)$.

## 4: Analyze Potential Student Responses
Given the analysis, the correct answer is that only Katie is correct, which corresponds to option B.

## 5: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand the basic properties of linear and quadratic equations. They might incorrectly identify both functions as linear or not understand what it means for functions to cross the $y$-axis. However, the question's nature and the use of a graphing program could help visualize the concepts. Expect a high percentage to select incorrect options due to misunderstanding of function types and $y$-intercepts. 
  - A: XX% (some might incorrectly think Tom is right)
  - B: XX% (could recognize Katie's correctness with help)
  - C: XX% (unlikely, as requires understanding both are not correct for Tom and correct for Katie)
  - D: XX% (might think neither is correct if completely misunderstand)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still confuse linear and quadratic functions. They might recognize $y=x-4$ as linear but struggle with $y=x^{2} - 4$. 
  - A: High percentage (mistakenly think Tom is correct)
  - B: Significant percentage (recognize Katie's correctness)
  - C: Low percentage (understand Tom is wrong, Katie is right)
  - D: Some percentage (think neither is correct, possibly due to confusion)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the difference between linear and quadratic functions and can calculate $y$-intercepts. 
  - A: Low percentage (know Tom is wrong)
  - B: High percentage (recognize Katie's correctness)
  - C: Low percentage (since Tom is wrong and Katie is right)
  - D: Low percentage (since Katie is correct)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can easily identify function types and $y$-intercepts. 
  - A: Very low percentage
  - B: High percentage
  - C: Very low percentage
  - D: Very low percentage

## 6: Assign Percentages
Based on typical student understanding and the specific question:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
- **Proficient**: A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
