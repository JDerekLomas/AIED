## Step 1: Understand the question and the concept being tested
The question involves the enlargement of a rectangle by a scale factor of 1.5. The original rectangle is labeled P, and the enlarged rectangle is labeled Q. The dimensions of Q are given as width = 9cm and length = 12cm. We need to find the length of rectangle P, which is marked with a star.

## 2: Determine the relationship between the rectangles
Since rectangle P has been enlarged by a scale factor of 1.5 to give rectangle Q, we can use this scale factor to find the dimensions of P. The formula to find the original dimensions is: original dimension = enlarged dimension / scale factor.

## 3: Calculate the length of rectangle P
Given that the length of Q is 12cm and the scale factor is 1.5, we can calculate the length of P as follows: length of P = 12cm / 1.5 = 8cm.

## 4: Consider potential misconceptions and errors
A common misconception might be to confuse the scale factor with a simple multiplication or division without considering the direction of the transformation (i.e., from P to Q or from Q to P). However, given the straightforward nature of the calculation and the fact that students are asked to work backwards from Q to P, most students should be able to perform the calculation correctly.

## 5: Evaluate the difficulty level and predict student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic calculations or understanding the concept of scale factor. They might incorrectly apply the scale factor or confuse the operations. Given the simplicity of the calculation (12 / 1.5), even students at this level might still manage to get it right or choose an obviously incorrect option.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should understand the concept of scale factor and be able to apply it in simple calculations. They are likely to calculate the length correctly as 8cm.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily understand the concept and apply it correctly, choosing option A (8cm) as the correct answer.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level would not only calculate the answer correctly but also understand the implications of the scale factor on area and other properties. They would definitely choose option A.

## 6: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the straightforward calculation:
- The correct answer is A (8cm).
- Option B (10.5cm) could be a result of incorrectly applying the scale factor or a miscalculation.
- Option C (9cm) might be chosen by those who mistakenly use the width of Q or incorrectly calculate.
- Option D (6cm) seems less likely as it suggests a larger error.

## 7: Assign percentages based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: A=50%, B=20%, C=20%, D=10% (struggle with basic math, might guess or calculate incorrectly)
- **Basic**: A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5% (understand scale factor, minor errors)
- **Proficient**: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1% (apply concept correctly, few errors)
- **Advanced**: A=99%, B=0.5%, C=0.3%, D=0.2% (high understanding, very few errors)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.3% D=0.2%
