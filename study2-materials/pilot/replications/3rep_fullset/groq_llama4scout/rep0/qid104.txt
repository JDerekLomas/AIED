To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or correct steps involved.

The equation given is \((d-6)^{2}-16=0\). A correct next step to solve this equation would involve isolating the squared term, which is:

\((d-6)^{2} = 16\)

Taking the square root of both sides gives:

\(d-6 = \pm 4\)

This step is crucial as it directly addresses how to proceed from the given equation.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Step
The correct next step after \((d-6)^{2}=16\) is indeed \(d-6 = \pm 4\), which corresponds to option B. This is a fundamental algebraic manipulation.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A suggests \(d^{2}=22\). This would not be a correct step from \((d-6)^{2}=16\). To get \(d^{2}=22\), one would have to expand \((d-6)^{2}=16\) incorrectly or apply an incorrect operation.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \(d-6=4\), is partially correct in that it acknowledges taking the square root, but it misses the \(\pm\) part, which is crucial for solving quadratic equations that result in a perfect square.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \(d-3=8\), seems unrelated to the given equation and its correct manipulation. It does not follow from \((d-6)^{2}=16\).

## 5: Ability Level Predictions
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might be tempted by options that seem simpler or more direct but are incorrect. Option C might appeal because it simplifies the square root step but forgets the negative root. Option A could attract those who misunderstand how to expand or manipulate equations. Option D seems unlikely as it introduces an unrelated and incorrect step.

- **Basic:** Students here might understand basic algebra but could still fall into traps. They are likely to recognize the correct step (B) but might also consider C as a viable option because it represents a common misconception about square roots.

- **Proficient:** These students are expected to handle algebraic manipulations confidently. They should recognize B as the correct next step. Options A, C, and D should be less appealing as they represent incorrect manipulations or misconceptions.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to not only solve equations but also to do so efficiently and accurately. They are likely to quickly identify B as the correct option and dismiss the others due to their clear errors.

## 6: Percentage Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (incorrect expansion), B=20% (understands correct step but might not execute it), C=30% (forgets negative root), D=20% (unrelated step).
- **Basic:** A=15% (some struggle with correct expansion), B=60% (recognizes correct step), C=20% (common misconception), D=5% (unlikely to choose unrelated step).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (should understand correct expansion), B=80% (correct step), C=10% (might forget negative root), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (clearly incorrect), B=95% (efficient and accurate), C=3% (unlikely to forget negative root), D=2% (very unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
