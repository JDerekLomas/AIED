## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to calculate the value of \( P \) when \( k = -3 \) in the equation \( P = 4^k \). This involves understanding negative exponents.

## 2: Negative Exponents Concept
A negative exponent implies taking the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent. Therefore, \( 4^{-3} = \frac{1}{4^3} \).

## 3: Calculating \( 4^3 \)
\( 4^3 = 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64 \).

## 4: Applying Negative Exponent Rule
Using the negative exponent rule, \( 4^{-3} = \frac{1}{4^3} = \frac{1}{64} \).

## 5: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \( -12 \) is incorrect because it doesn't relate to the calculation of \( 4^{-3} \).
- Option B: \( -64 \) is incorrect because it's \( 4^3 \), not \( 4^{-3} \), and it's also negative.
- Option C: \( \frac{1}{64} \) is correct based on the calculation.
- Option D: \( -\frac{1}{64} \) is incorrect because \( 4^{-3} \) is positive, not negative.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with exponents and negative numbers. They might incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the concept of negative exponents, potentially leading to a higher chance of selecting incorrect options like A or B. However, given the straightforward nature of the calculation once the concept is understood, they might still have a significant chance of guessing or selecting C.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and are more likely to apply the negative exponent rule correctly, leading to a higher percentage choosing C. Mistakes might occur due to calculation errors rather than conceptual misunderstandings.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a solid grasp of exponent rules, including negative exponents. They should accurately calculate \( 4^{-3} \) as \( \frac{1}{64} \), making C the most likely correct choice.
- **Advanced**: Similar to proficient students, advanced students should easily and accurately apply the concept of negative exponents, selecting C.

## 7: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (misunderstanding of negative exponents), B=30% (confusing with positive exponent), C=40% (correct but through luck or simple recall), D=10% (incorrectly applying rules).
- **Basic**: A=5% (simple mistake), B=10% (misapplication of rules), C=80% (correct application), D=5% (error in calculation).
- **Proficient**: A=0% (understands concept), B=0% (knows it's not a positive exponent), C=95% (correctly applies rule), D=5% (rare calculation mistake).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (concept understood), B=0% (rule application correct), C=99% (very confident in calculation), D=1% (extremely rare error).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%
