## Step 1: Analyzing the sequence for a pattern
The given sequence is \(10, 21, 34, 49, 66, \ldots\). To find the pattern, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms: \(21 - 10 = 11\), \(34 - 21 = 13\), \(49 - 34 = 15\), \(66 - 49 = 17\). We can see that the differences between terms are increasing by 2 each time.

## 2: Identifying the sequence type
This pattern suggests that the sequence is not arithmetic (since the differences between terms are not constant) but could be quadratic. A quadratic sequence often arises when the differences of the differences are constant, which is the case here (the differences are 11, 13, 15, 17, ... and the differences of these are all 2).

## 3: Finding the nth-term rule
For a quadratic sequence, the nth-term rule can be expressed in the form \(an^2 + bn + c\). Given the sequence starts with \(n=1\) for the first term:
- For \(n=1\), the term is \(10\), so \(a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 10\) or \(a + b + c = 10\).
- For \(n=2\), the term is \(21\), so \(a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 21\) or \(4a + 2b + c = 21\).
- For \(n=3\), the term is \(34\), so \(a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 34\) or \(9a + 3b + c = 34\).

## 4: Solving for a, b, and c
Solving these equations simultaneously:
1. \(a + b + c = 10\)
2. \(4a + 2b + c = 21\)
3. \(9a + 3b + c = 34\)

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 gives \(3a + b = 11\).
Subtracting equation 2 from equation 3 gives \(5a + b = 13\).

Subtracting these two new equations (\(5a + b = 13\)) - (\(3a + b = 11\)) gives \(2a = 2\), so \(a = 1\).

## 5: Substituting a back into the simplified equations
Substituting \(a = 1\) into \(3a + b = 11\) gives \(3(1) + b = 11\), so \(3 + b = 11\), which means \(b = 8\).

## 6: Finding c
Substituting \(a = 1\) and \(b = 8\) into \(a + b + c = 10\) gives \(1 + 8 + c = 10\), so \(c = 1\).

## 7: Constructing the nth-term rule
The nth-term rule is \(n^2 + 8n + 1\). Comparing this to the given form \(n^2 \triangle n \square\), we see that \(\triangle = 8\) and \(\square = 1\).

## 8: Predicting student responses
- The question asks for \(\triangle\), which we've found to be \(8\). So, \(D: +8\) is correct.
- \(A: 5.5\) seems unrelated to our calculation.
- \(B: -8\) is incorrect because \(\triangle\) is positive.
- \(C: +1\) refers to \(\square\), not \(\triangle\).

## 9: Estimating student performance
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle to identify the pattern or solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). They might guess or choose an option that seems plausible without calculation, such as \(A\) or \(B\). \(A=30\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=30\%\)
- **Basic**: Students can follow a pattern but might make computational errors. They are more likely to identify \(D\) as correct but might also consider \(B\) or \(C\) if they misunderstand the sequence or the formula. \(A=10\%\), \(B=15\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=65\%\)
- **Proficient**: Students should easily identify the sequence and solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). They are likely to choose \(D\). \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=85\%\)
- **Advanced**: These students will quickly and accurately solve the problem, choosing \(D\). \(A=0\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=0\%\), \(D=100\%\)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C
