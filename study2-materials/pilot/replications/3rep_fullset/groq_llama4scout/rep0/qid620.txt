To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions related to reflection in mathematics.

The question involves reflecting a point across a vertical line \(x = 4\). The point \(C\) needs to be reflected. Assuming \(C\) is at \((5, 5)\) based on a typical graph provided (though the exact coordinates of \(C\) are not given, we can infer from the options), reflecting \(C\) across \(x = 4\) means finding a point that is the same distance on the other side of \(x = 4\). 

The distance from \(x = 5\) to \(x = 4\) is \(1\), so on the other side of \(x = 4\), the \(x\)-coordinate would be \(4 - 1 = 3\). Thus, the reflected point \(C\) would be at \((3, 5)\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Reflection Process
To reflect a point across a line \(x = a\), if the point is \((x, y)\), its reflection across \(x = a\) is \((2a - x, y)\). Applying this to \(x = 4\), the reflection of \((x, y)\) is \((8 - x, y)\). If \(C\) is originally at \((5, 5)\), then its reflection is \((8 - 5, 5) = (3, 5)\).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \((3, 5)\) matches our calculation.
- Option B: \((6, 3)\) suggests a reflection and possibly a misunderstanding of coordinates.
- Option C: \((4, 5)\) suggests \(C\) is on the line of reflection, which is not the case.
- Option D: \((2, 5)\) suggests a different kind of symmetry or error.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students might not fully understand reflection or might confuse it with rotation or other transformations. They might choose based on visual cues or simple errors. Option A seems correct, but others might choose due to misconceptions. **A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%**
- **Basic**: Students understand basic concepts but might struggle with application. They are likely to get it right if they've practiced reflections. **A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%**
- **Proficient**: Students have a good grasp of the concept and are likely to choose the correct option. **A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%**
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand but can also explain their reasoning. They would almost certainly choose the correct option. **A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
