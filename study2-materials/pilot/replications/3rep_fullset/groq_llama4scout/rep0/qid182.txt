To predict how students at different ability levels would respond to this question, let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions related to factorization.

The expression given is \(p^{2} - 16\). This is a difference of squares, which can be factorized into \((p + 4)(p - 4)\). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not recognizing the difference of squares or incorrectly applying factorization rules. For instance, some students might try to factor out a common factor that isn't there (leading to option C), or they might mistakenly think it's a perfect square trinomial (leading to option A).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \((p-4)(p-4)\) suggests a perfect square trinomial, which is incorrect for \(p^{2} - 16\).
- Option B: \((p+4)(p-4)\) is the correct factorization for a difference of squares.
- Option C: \(p(p-16)\) is an incorrect factorization; it suggests factoring out \(p\), which doesn't apply here.
- Option D: "Does not factorise" is incorrect because \(p^{2} - 16\) can indeed be factorized.

## 3: Ability Level Predictions
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and recognizing patterns. They might be more likely to choose an option that doesn't require recognizing the difference of squares, such as C (a simple factorization attempt) or A (mistaking it for a square). D might also be chosen due to a lack of understanding. 
  - A: 20% (mistaking for a perfect square)
  - B: 30% (getting it right by chance or understanding)
  - C: 30% (incorrect factorization)
  - D: 20% (not understanding factorization applies)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes or not fully grasp the nuances of factorization.
  - A: 15% (less likely to make the perfect square mistake)
  - B: 60% (recognizing the difference of squares)
  - C: 20% (attempting a simple factor)
  - D: 5% (understanding it can factorize)

- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and should easily recognize the difference of squares.
  - A: 5% (unlikely to make the mistake)
  - B: 80% (confidently correct)
  - C: 10% (possible but less likely mistake)
  - D: 5% (aware it factorises)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can handle complex algebraic expressions.
  - A: 0% (unlikely to make such a basic mistake)
  - B: 95% (straightforward recognition of difference of squares)
  - C: 0% (not likely to confuse with simple factor)
  - D: 5% (extremely unlikely to think it doesn't factorize)

## 4: Conclusion
Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
