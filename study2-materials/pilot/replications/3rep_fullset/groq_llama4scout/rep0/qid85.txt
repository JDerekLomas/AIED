## Step 1: Understand the sequence rule
The sequence is given by the rule \(2 - 7n\), where \(n\) represents the term number in the sequence. To find the first term, we substitute \(n = 1\) into the rule.

## 2: Calculate the first term
Substituting \(n = 1\) into the rule \(2 - 7n\), we get \(2 - 7(1) = 2 - 7 = -5\). This means the first term of the sequence is \(-5\).

## 3: Identify the correct answer
From the calculation, the correct answer is \(C) -5\).

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception might involve misunderstanding the sequence rule or incorrectly substituting \(n\). For example, some students might mistakenly use \(n = 0\) or incorrectly calculate the term.

## 5: Evaluate the question for potential traps
The question directly provides the formula and asks for the first term, which is a straightforward calculation. There are no complex patterns or additional information that could distract from the calculation.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with substituting \(n = 1\) into the equation or calculating \(2 - 7\). They might choose \(A = 1\) because they don't substitute \(n\), or \(B = -7\) if they only consider the \(-7n\) part. \(C = -5\) seems unlikely if they can't do the calculation, but \(D = 9\) could be a random guess. So, \(A = 30\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 40\%\).
- **Basic:** These students can perform basic algebraic manipulations. They might still make errors in calculation or substitution. So, \(A = 15\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 70\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Proficient:** Students at this level are comfortable with algebraic expressions and can accurately substitute \(n = 1\). Errors here would be minimal. So, \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 85\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Advanced:** These students not only can perform the calculation correctly but also understand the context. Errors would be very minimal. So, \(A = 2\%\), \(B = 2\%\), \(C = 90\%\), \(D = 6\%\).

## 7: Format the predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
- basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- advanced: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
