To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question revolves around understanding what constitutes a common factor in algebraic expressions. 

- Tom claims \(4\) is a common factor of \(6x\) and \(9y^2\). For \(4\) to be a common factor, both \(6x\) and \(9y^2\) must be divisible by \(4\). \(6x = 2 \times 3 \times x\), and \(9y^2 = 3^2 \times y^2\). Since \(4\) does not divide \(6x\) (as \(6x\) does not have \(2^2\) as a factor) or \(9y^2\) (as \(9y^2\) does not have \(2^2\) as a factor), Tom's statement is incorrect without considering specific values of \(x\) and \(y\).

- Katie claims \(y\) is a common factor of \(6x\) and \(9y^2\). \(6x = 2 \times 3 \times x\) and \(9y^2 = 3^2 \times y^2\). For \(y\) to be a common factor, it must divide both expressions. However, \(y\) does not necessarily divide \(6x\) unless \(x\) is a multiple of \(y\), but \(y\) will always divide \(9y^2\). Thus, \(y\) isn't a guaranteed common factor unless specified that \(x\) is a multiple of \(y\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Conditions for Common Factors
To assess Tom's claim, we need to see if \(4\) can be a factor of both \(6x\) and \(9y^2\), which it cannot because neither expression guarantees a \(2^2\) factor. For Katie, \(y\) can be a factor of \(9y^2\) but not necessarily of \(6x\) without \(x\) containing \(y\).

## 2: Evaluating Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to overlook the conditions under which \(4\) or \(y\) could be considered common factors. Students might mistakenly think \(4\) could be a factor if they forget that \(x\) and \(y\) can be any value, or they might incorrectly assume \(y\) is a factor of \(6x\).

## 3: Assessing Student Understanding by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the abstract concepts of factors in algebraic expressions. They might incorrectly assume Tom is right if they misunderstand what makes a common factor or might not engage deeply with the conditions required for \(y\) to be a common factor. 
  - A=40% (misunderstanding about factors), B=20% (not fully grasping conditions for \(y\)), C=10% (difficulty seeing both are incorrect), D=30% (completely lost).

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still fall into traps. They might recognize \(4\) isn't a factor but struggle with the conditions for \(y\).
  - A=30%, B=25%, C=5%, D=40%.

- **Proficient**: These students understand factors well but might need a moment to apply it. They should see Tom is wrong and question Katie's claim based on \(x\) and \(y\)'s relationship.
  - A=10%, B=20%, C=5%, D=65%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level quickly recognize both claims' validity based on \(x\), \(y\), and their ability to factor expressions. They'd accurately assess that Tom's claim is wrong because \(4\) isn't inherently a factor of \(6x\) or \(9y^2\), and Katie's claim depends on \(x\) and \(y\).
  - A=5%, B=5%, C=0%, D=90%.

The best answer is below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=20% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
