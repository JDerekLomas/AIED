To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with solving equations.

The equation given is \(\frac{m}{4} - 1 = 20\). The task is to evaluate the first steps proposed by Tom and Katie to solve this equation.

## Step 1: Understand Tom's Proposal
Tom suggests writing \(\frac{m}{4} = 21\). To assess if this is correct, we add 1 to both sides of the original equation:
\(\frac{m}{4} - 1 + 1 = 20 + 1\), which simplifies to \(\frac{m}{4} = 21\). Therefore, Tom's proposal is correct.

## 2: Understand Katie's Proposal
Katie suggests writing \(m - 1 = 80\). To evaluate this, we first multiply every term in the original equation by 4 to clear the denominator:
\(m - 4 = 80\). However, Katie's step seems to misunderstand the operation; correctly multiplying both sides by 4 yields \(m - 4 = 80\), not \(m - 1 = 80\). The correct manipulation to match Katie's form would actually involve multiplying both sides by 4:
\(\frac{m}{4} \cdot 4 - 1 \cdot 4 = 20 \cdot 4\), resulting in \(m - 4 = 80\). So, Katie's suggestion as presented doesn't directly derive from standard algebraic manipulations of the given equation without an error in presentation. The accurate reflection of her step would be considered incorrect based on standard procedures.

## 3: Analyze Potential Misconceptions
- A common misconception might involve incorrectly applying operations to solve equations, such as forgetting to apply the operation to all terms or misinterpreting the equation's structure.
- However, in this case, Tom's step is algebraically sound and straightforward. Katie's step, as presented, might confuse students if they misinterpret the algebraic manipulation.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly validate both or neither due to a lack of understanding of how to isolate \(m\). However, given the straightforward nature of Tom's correction, more might recognize Tom's correctness. 
  - A=60% (recognizing Tom's correct step directly)
  - B=10% (misunderstanding Katie's step)
  - C=10% (not understanding either)
  - D=20% (not recognizing either as correct)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding of algebra. They are more likely to recognize Tom's correctness but might be confused by Katie's step.
  - A=80% (correctly identifying Tom)
  - B=5% (misinterpreting Katie)
  - C=5% (not understanding)
  - D=10% (recognizing neither as properly derived)

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic manipulations. They should easily recognize Tom's step as correct and Katie's as incorrect or not directly derived.
  - A=90% 
  - B=0% (understanding Katie's doesn't directly follow)
  - C=5% (unlikely both are correct)
  - D=5%

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the algebraic manipulations but are also adept at evaluating the correctness of proposed steps. They will almost certainly recognize Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrect presentation.
  - A=95% 
  - B=0% 
  - C=0% 
  - D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
