To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding that students might have.

The question presents a division problem: \(231 \div 4\), with John's answer being \(57\) remainder \(3\). The task is to find the exact value of that remainder.

## Step 1: Understand the Division and Remainder
First, let's calculate \(231 \div 4\) to understand the correct answer. \(231 \div 4 = 57.75\). This means \(57 \times 4 = 228\), and \(231 - 228 = 3\). So, John's answer of \(57\) remainder \(3\) is actually correct in terms of integer division. However, the question asks for the exact value of the remainder, which implies a decimal representation.

## 2: Convert Remainder to Decimal
The remainder when dividing \(231\) by \(4\) is \(3\). To express this as a decimal, we consider it as \(3/4 = 0.75\). 

## 3: Analyze Potential Student Responses
- **A: \(3\)**: This is the remainder in its integer form.
- **B: \(0.34\)**: This seems to be an incorrect conversion.
- **C: \(0.3\)**: Another incorrect conversion, possibly due to rounding.
- **D: \(0.75\)**: This is the correct decimal representation of the remainder.

## 4: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with division and converting remainders to decimals. They might not fully understand the concept of remainders in decimal form. Expect a high chance of choosing A, with some possibly selecting B or C due to miscalculation.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with converting the remainder into a decimal accurately. They are likely to choose A or might be tempted by B or C if they misunderstand decimal conversion.
- **Proficient**: These students should understand division, remainders, and conversion to decimals. They are likely to choose D, recognizing \(3/4 = 0.75\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including precise decimal representations. They will likely choose D.

## 5: Estimate Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=70%, B=15%, C=10%, D=5%
- **Basic**: A=50%, B=20%, C=20%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=20%, B=5%, C=5%, D=70%
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=0%, C=0%, D=95%

The best answer is D.
