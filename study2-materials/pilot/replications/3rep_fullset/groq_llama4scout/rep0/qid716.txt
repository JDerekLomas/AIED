To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question is about bearings, specifically identifying the bearing of North-West on a compass. A bearing is measured clockwise from North, and it uses three digits. 

- North is $000^\circ$ or $360^\circ$,
- East is $090^\circ$,
- South is $180^\circ$,
- West is $270^\circ$.

North-West is halfway between North and West. Therefore, its bearing can be calculated by finding the midpoint between $000^\circ$ (North) and $270^\circ$ (West), which is $\frac{0 + 270}{2} = 135^\circ$. However, another way to think about North-West is that it is $45^\circ$ from both North and West towards each other. 

The compass rose or the directions can help: 
- North is $000^\circ$,
- North-East is $045^\circ$,
- East is $090^\circ$,
- South-East is $135^\circ$,
- South is $180^\circ$,
- South-West is $225^\circ$,
- West is $270^\circ$,
- North-West is $315^\circ$.

Given this, North-West corresponds to $315^\circ$.

Now, considering student responses based on ability levels:

## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question simply asks for the bearing of North-West, which corresponds to $315^\circ$.

## 2: Analyzing potential misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the direction or not converting the directional term into a bearing correctly. However, this question is quite straightforward as it directly relates to understanding the basic points of the compass.

## 3: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding compass directions and converting them into bearings. They might choose an option based on a misunderstanding of the directions (e.g., thinking West is $90^\circ$, which would lead them to choose $270^\circ$ for West but not correctly calculating North-West). 
  - A ($270^{\circ}$) might seem like West, not North-West, so $10\%$.
  - B ($225^{\circ}$) could be confused with South-West, $20\%$.
  - C ($045^{\circ}$) is North-East, not related, $10\%$.
  - D ($315^{\circ}$) is North-West, $60\%$.

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic directions but might still make errors with bearings.
  - A ($270^{\circ}$), $5\%$.
  - B ($225^{\circ}$), $10\%$.
  - C ($045^{\circ}$), $5\%$.
  - D ($315^{\circ}$), $80\%$.

- **Proficient:** These students understand bearings well and should accurately identify North-West.
  - A ($270^{\circ}$), $1\%$.
  - B ($225^{\circ}$), $2\%$.
  - C ($045^{\circ}$), $1\%$.
  - D ($315^{\circ}$), $96\%$.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong understanding and rarely make mistakes.
  - A ($270^{\circ}$), $0\%$.
  - B ($225^{\circ}$), $0\%$.
  - C ($045^{\circ}$), $0\%$.
  - D ($315^{\circ}$), $100\%$.

The best answer is D. 

Given the analysis:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
proficient: A=1% B=2% C=1% D=96%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
