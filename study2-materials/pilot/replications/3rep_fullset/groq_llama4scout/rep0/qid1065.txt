To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question presents a horizontal line that passes through the y-axis at -2. The correct equation for a horizontal line is \(y = c\), where \(c\) is the y-intercept. Therefore, the equation of this line is \(y = -2\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires the student to identify the equation of a horizontal line that intersects the y-axis at -2. This is a straightforward concept in coordinate geometry.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the equation of a horizontal line with that of a vertical line. A vertical line has an equation of the form \(x = c\), where \(c\) is the x-intercept. Another potential misconception could involve misunderstanding the general forms of linear equations, such as \(y = mx + b\) or \(y = mx\), and applying them incorrectly.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(x = -2\) represents a vertical line, not a horizontal one.
- Option B: \(y = -2x\) represents a line with a slope of -2 and a y-intercept of 0, which does not match the given line.
- Option C: \(xy = -2\) represents a hyperbola, not a line.
- Option D: \(y = -2\) correctly represents a horizontal line with a y-intercept of -2.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic concepts of geometry and algebra. They might confuse the line's equation with a vertical line or a different form of equation.
  - A: \(x=-2\) might appeal to those confusing it with a vertical line, so \(A = 40\%\).
  - B: \(y = -2x\) could be chosen by those who incorrectly apply the slope-intercept form without understanding the line is horizontal, \(B = 20\%\).
  - C: \(xy = -2\) might be chosen by those with little understanding of linear equations, \(C = 20\%\).
  - D: \(y = -2\) is the correct answer but might not be chosen by many due to confusion, \(D = 20\%\).

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple mistakes.
  - A: \(30\%\)
  - B: \(15\%\)
  - C: \(10\%\)
  - D: \(45\%\)

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid understanding of linear equations and should be able to identify the correct equation easily.
  - A: \(5\%\)
  - B: \(5\%\)
  - C: \(5\%\)
  - D: \(85\%\)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately and quickly.
  - A: \(0\%\)
  - B: \(0\%\)
  - C: \(0\%\)
  - D: \(100\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
