## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a table with two criteria: being a multiple of 4 and being a factor of 60. The task is to determine where the number 30 should be placed in the table.

## 2: Analyzing the Number 30
To place 30 correctly, we need to check two conditions:
1. Is 30 a multiple of 4?
2. Is 30 a factor of 60?

## 3: Checking if 30 is a Multiple of 4
30 divided by 4 equals 7.5, which means 30 is not a multiple of 4.

## 4: Checking if 30 is a Factor of 60
The factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60. Since 30 is among these factors, 30 is a factor of 60.

## 5: Placing 30 in the Table
Given that 30 is not a multiple of 4 but is a factor of 60, it should be placed in box B.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic concepts of factors and multiples. They might incorrectly identify 30 as a multiple of 4 or not recognize it as a factor of 60. Expect a high chance of error, possibly A = 30% (thinking it's a multiple of 4 and a factor), B = 40% (correct), C = 15% (not a factor), D = 15% (neither condition).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic mathematical concepts but might still make simple errors. They should recognize 30 as a factor of 60 but might be tricked into thinking it's a multiple of 4. Expect B = 70%, with some errors: A = 20%, C = 5%, D = 5%.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand both factors and multiples well. They should easily identify 30 as a factor of 60 and not a multiple of 4. Expect B = 90%, with minor errors: A = 5%, C = 3%, D = 2%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts and are less likely to make errors on this type of question. Expect B = 95%, with very few errors: A = 2%, C = 2%, D = 1%.

## 7: Adjusting Predictions
Given the nature of the question and common misconceptions, the predictions need to reflect the likelihood of students making errors based on the specifics of the question. The question directly tests understanding of two specific mathematical concepts (being a factor of 60 and a multiple of 4) without complex calculations, making it more straightforward.

## 8: Final Predictions
- **below_basic**: A = 25% B = 40% C = 20% D = 15%
- **basic**: A = 15% B = 80% C = 3% D = 2%
- **proficient**: A = 5% B = 90% C = 3% D = 2%
- **advanced**: A = 2% B = 95% C = 2% D = 1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=80% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
