To approach this question, let's consider what it tests: the steps involved in finding the range of a data set. The range is calculated by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value. The options provided relate to steps that may or may not be necessary in finding the range.

- **Option A (Subtract the smallest number from the largest number)**: This is the actual step needed to find the range.
- **Option B (Check the units of your answer)**: This could be considered a good practice, as ensuring the units are correct is important in any mathematical calculation. However, it's not a step directly involved in calculating the range but rather in presenting or verifying the answer.
- **Option C (Add all the numbers together)**: This step is irrelevant to finding the range. It's actually part of calculating the mean.
- **Option D (Write the numbers in ascending or descending order)**: While not strictly necessary for finding the range (as one only needs to identify the smallest and largest numbers), it can be helpful in organizing the data and ensuring the correct numbers are used.

Given these considerations:

- **Students below_basic**: These students might struggle with understanding the basic statistical terms and operations. They might incorrectly think adding all numbers (C) or other steps are necessary for the range. Option A seems directly related to range, so they might not choose that as "never needed." 
  - below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%

- **Basic students**: At this level, students have a foundational understanding but might still be confused about what steps are necessary for different statistical calculations. They are likely to recognize that adding all numbers (C) is not needed for the range but might be unsure about the necessity of organizing data (D) or checking units (B).
  - basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%

- **Proficient students**: These students understand the calculation of range and are less likely to confuse it with other statistical measures. They should recognize that adding all the numbers (C) is unnecessary for finding the range. They might see checking units (B) as good practice but not a step in calculation.
  - proficient: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%

- **Advanced students**: At this level, students not only understand the calculations but also the reasoning behind the steps. They are likely to quickly identify that adding all numbers (C) is not needed and might view checking units (B) and organizing data (D) as either unnecessary or not directly involved in the calculation of range.
  - advanced: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%

These predictions reflect how students at different levels might approach the question based on their understanding of statistical concepts and the specific steps involved in calculating the range of a data set.
