## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires finding the value of \( x \) in a triangle with angles labeled as \( 4x \), \( 2x - 12 \), and \( 4x + 42 \). The key concept here is that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

## 2: Setting Up the Equation
To find \( x \), we set up the equation based on the sum of the angles in a triangle:
\[ 4x + (2x - 12) + (4x + 42) = 180 \]

## 3: Solving the Equation
Simplifying and solving for \( x \):
\[ 4x + 2x - 12 + 4x + 42 = 180 \]
\[ 10x + 30 = 180 \]
\[ 10x = 150 \]
\[ x = 15 \]

## 4: Analyzing the Options
Given the solution \( x = 15 \), let's look at the options:
- A: \( x = 15^\circ \)
- B: \( x = 12.6^\circ \)
- C: \( x = 33^\circ \)
- D: \( x = 21^\circ \)

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with setting up the equation or solving for \( x \). They might not correctly add the angles or might make calculation errors. Option A is the correct answer, but due to potential calculation mistakes, B, C, or D might also be chosen. However, without a clear misconception triggered here, most might still attempt and get A, but with a higher chance of error: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to set up and solve the equation but might make minor calculation errors. The correct answer is straightforward: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve the equation correctly. There's little room for error in calculation: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only solve it correctly but also quickly. The question doesn't pose a challenge for them: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.3% D=0.2%.

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the steps and understanding of typical student performance:
- below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- proficient: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
- advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.3% D=0.2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.3% D=0.2%
