To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the size of angle \( k \) in a triangle with one angle of 40 degrees and another of 32 degrees, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or understanding related to the sum of angles in a triangle.

The sum of angles in any triangle is \( 180\degree \). Given two angles are \( 40\degree \) and \( 32\degree \), the third angle \( k \) can be calculated as:
\[ k = 180\degree - 40\degree - 32\degree = 108\degree \]

So, the correct answer is \( C = 108\degree \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception or Error
A common misconception could be not recognizing that the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180\degree \) or making a calculation error. However, given the straightforward nature of this calculation and the fact that it does not involve more complex geometric properties or constructions, it's likely that most students, even at lower ability levels, would be able to compute \( k \) correctly if they recall the basic property of triangles.

## 2: Analyzing Option Attractiveness
- Option A (\( 72\degree \)) might appeal to students who incorrectly subtract the given angles from \( 180\degree \) but make a calculation mistake: \( 180\degree - 40\degree = 140\degree \), then \( 140\degree - 32\degree = 108\degree \), so it's less likely to be chosen by those who can perform the subtraction.
- Option B (\( 90\degree \)) could attract students who mistakenly think one of the angles must be a right angle or make a significant calculation error.
- Option D (\( 118\degree \)) could be chosen by students who add the two given angles and subtract from \( 180\degree \) but get the operation wrong: \( 40\degree + 32\degree = 72\degree \), then \( 180\degree - 72\degree = 108\degree \), indicating a misunderstanding or miscalculation.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic or not recall the \( 180\degree \) rule. They might choose B (\( 90\degree \)) if they think a triangle must have a right angle or make significant errors. Option A and D might also be chosen due to arithmetic mistakes. 
  - Below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%

- **Basic**: Students here should have a better grasp of basic geometry but might still make arithmetic errors. They are likely to choose C, but some might opt for A or D due to miscalculations.
  - Basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a solid understanding of geometric principles, including the sum of angles in a triangle. They are likely to choose C correctly, with minimal errors.
  - Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less likely to make errors on such a straightforward question. They should nearly all choose C.
  - Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
