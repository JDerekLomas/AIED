## Step 1: Understand the question and the content being tested
The question asks students to identify a factor of the expression \(6n^{2} - 9\). To solve this, students need to factorize the expression and see which of the given options is a factor.

## 2: Factorize the given expression
The expression can be factorized by first factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF), which in this case is 3. So, \(6n^{2} - 9 = 3(2n^{2} - 3)\). This step is crucial for identifying factors.

## 3: Analyze the options with the factorized form
- Option A: \(6\). There's no \(6\) factored out from the expression \(6n^{2} - 9\), so it's not a factor of the entire expression \(6n^{2} - 9\), but rather \(6\) is part of \(6n^{2}\).
- Option B: \(9\). \(9\) is not a factor of \(6n^{2} - 9\) since \(9\) does not divide \(6n^{2}\) evenly and the constant term is \(-9\), which is \(9 \times -1\), not fitting with \(6n^{2}\) for any \(n\).
- Option C: \(n\). \(n\) is not a factor of the entire expression \(6n^{2} - 9\) because it's not common to both terms after factorization.
- Option D: \(3\). From the factorization \(3(2n^{2} - 3)\), it's clear that \(3\) is a factor.

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception might be to think that \(6\) or \(9\) could be factors because they are part of the coefficients or constant term. However, students who are proficient in algebra should recognize that factors must divide the entire expression without a remainder.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand factorization or might confuse factors with terms. They might choose \(6\) (A) because it's a big number in the expression, \(9\) (B) because it's the constant term's absolute value, \(n\) (C) because it's a variable, or they might not recognize \(3\) (D) as a clear factor from basic observations. Expect high errors.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and might see that \(3\) is a factor by simple observation (\(6n^{2}\) is divisible by \(3\) and \(-9\) is divisible by \(3\)). They might still be tricked into choosing \(6\) or \(9\), but \(3\) should be recognizable.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily identify \(3\) as a factor through factorization. They are less likely to be tricked by \(6\), \(9\), or \(n\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will quickly factor the expression and confirm \(3\) is a factor, with little chance of error.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (easy to see \(6\)), B=20% (might think \(9\) is a factor), C=20% (variable might confuse), D=30% (some see \(3\)).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=15%, C=15%, D=50% (more see \(3\), but some errors).
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85% (mostly get \(3\), few errors).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (all get it right).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=15% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
