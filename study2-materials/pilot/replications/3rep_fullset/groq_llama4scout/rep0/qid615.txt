To approach this question, let's analyze the ratio and the information given: the ratio of cars to vans is \(5:3\), and there are \(80\) cars. 

## Step 1: Understand the Ratio
The ratio \(5:3\) for cars to vans means that for every \(5\) cars, there are \(3\) vans. This can be scaled up.

## 2: Find the Scale Factor for Cars
Given there are \(80\) cars and the ratio of cars to vans is \(5:3\), we find the scale factor by dividing the number of cars by the ratio part representing cars: \(80 \div 5 = 16\). This means the ratio is scaled by \(16\).

## 3: Calculate the Number of Vans
Using the scale factor \(16\), we multiply the number of vans in the ratio (\(3\)) by \(16\) to find the number of vans: \(3 \times 16 = 48\).

## 4: Calculate the Total Number of Vehicles
To find the total number of vehicles, we add the number of cars (\(80\)) to the number of vans (\(48\)): \(80 + 48 = 128\).

## 5: Analyze Potential Student Errors
- A common error might be misinterpreting the ratio or not scaling it correctly.
- Another error could be adding \(80\) (the number of cars) to a wrongly calculated number of vans or miscalculating the total.

## 6: Predict Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with ratios and scaling. They might not understand how to use the ratio to find the number of vans or might add \(80\) to a completely incorrect number. Option C (\(128\)) seems correct but let's see how errors play out: A (\(83\)) could result from \(80 + 3\), B (\(48\)) from only calculating vans, and D (\(110\)) from an incorrect total.
- **Basic**: These students should understand ratios but might make calculation errors. They are likely to get \(48\) vans correctly but might struggle with the total or choose an obviously incorrect option.
- **Proficient**: Students should easily calculate \(48\) vans and then \(128\) total vehicles. They might be tempted by incorrect calculations but should avoid obvious errors.
- **Advanced**: These students should not only calculate correctly but also understand the ratio's implications. They should uniformly choose C (\(128\)).

## 7: Estimate Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of scaling the ratio and adding:
- **Below Basic**: A=10% (guessing), B=20% (only vans), C=60% (correct), D=10% (random).
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=2%, B=5%, C=90%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=98%, D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=5% B=15% C=70% D=10%
basic: A=2% B=8% C=85% D=5%
proficient: A=1% B=3% C=92% D=4%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=96% D=3%
