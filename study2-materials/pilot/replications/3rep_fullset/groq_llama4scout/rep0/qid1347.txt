## Step 1: Understand the task
The task requires predicting the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for the given question about calculating the mean age from a table of ages and frequencies.

## 2: Analyze the question
The question asks for the most sensible heading for the third column in a table to calculate the mean age, given the ages and frequencies of people on a university running team. The mean age is calculated by summing the product of each age and its frequency, then dividing by the total frequency.

## 3: Identify the correct operation for the mean calculation
To calculate the mean, one must multiply each age by its frequency (to get the total age contribution of each group), sum these products, and then divide by the total frequency. Thus, the correct heading for the third column should facilitate the calculation of the sum of (age * frequency).

## 4: Evaluate the options
- Option A: Age + Frequency. This would not help in calculating the mean as it doesn't involve multiplication.
- Option B: Age - Frequency. This is also incorrect for the same reason.
- Option C: Age * Frequency. This option directly supports the calculation of the mean by providing the product of age and frequency for each group.
- Option D: Age / Frequency. This would not be useful for calculating the mean age.

## 5: Consider student misconceptions and understanding
Students might confuse the operations needed for calculating the mean. A common misconception could be adding or subtracting instead of multiplying, or misunderstanding the role of frequency.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of mean or the role of frequency in calculations. They might randomly choose or select based on a superficial understanding, leading to a higher chance of choosing incorrect options like A or B.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and are less likely to choose obviously incorrect operations like B (subtraction) or D (division), but might still struggle with the correct operation, potentially choosing A (addition) due to a common misconception.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of mean and are likely to choose C (Age * Frequency) as they recognize the need for multiplication to calculate the total age contribution.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but are also familiar with the formula for mean. They will almost certainly choose C.

## 7: Estimate percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- **Below_basic**: A=40% (addition seems like a simple operation), B=20% (less likely but possible), C=30% (some might get it), D=10% (unlikely).
- **Basic**: A=30%, B=15%, C=50% (more are likely to understand the need for multiplication), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 8: Finalize predictions
Based on step 7, but adjusting for a more realistic and nuanced understanding of student errors and the specific context of this question:
- **Below_basic**: A=50% B=15% C=25% D=10%
- **Basic**: A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=15% B=5% C=75% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=50% B=15% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=15% B=5% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%
