To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or understanding related to simplifying fractions.

The question presents two expressions and asks which of the two individuals, Tom or Katie, is correct in their simplification of \( \frac{3p - 1}{p} \). 

Tom's simplification: \( \frac{3p - 1}{p} \equiv 2 \)
Katie's simplification: \( \frac{3p - 1}{p} \equiv 3 - \frac{1}{p} \)

Let's simplify \( \frac{3p - 1}{p} \) to understand who is correct:
\( \frac{3p - 1}{p} = \frac{3p}{p} - \frac{1}{p} = 3 - \frac{1}{p} \)

This matches Katie's expression, not Tom's.

## Step 1: Understanding the Algebraic Manipulation
To solve \( \frac{3p - 1}{p} \), one simply splits the fraction into \( \frac{3p}{p} - \frac{1}{p} \), which simplifies to \( 3 - \frac{1}{p} \). This is a basic algebraic manipulation that students should be familiar with.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrectly splitting the fraction or not fully simplifying expressions. However, in this case, the algebraic manipulation is straightforward.

## 3: Evaluating Student Understanding at Different Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and might not understand how to properly simplify the given expression. They might incorrectly accept Tom's statement due to a lack of understanding of algebraic fractions. 
  - A (Only Tom): 40% (since they might mistakenly think Tom is right or not understand either)
  - B (Only Katie): 20% (if they somehow grasp Katie's correctness)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 10% (unlikely, as they'd need to see both are incorrect)
  - D (Neither is correct): 30% (if they realize both are wrong but can't articulate Katie's correctness)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and can perform simple algebraic manipulations. They are more likely to understand Katie's simplification but might still struggle with recognizing Tom's error.
  - A (Only Tom): 10%
  - B (Only Katie): 70%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 5%
  - D (Neither is correct): 15%

- **Proficient:** These students can handle algebraic manipulations confidently and should easily see that Katie is correct and Tom is incorrect.
  - A (Only Tom): 5%
  - B (Only Katie): 85%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 0%
  - D (Neither is correct): 10%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebra and can quickly identify the correct simplification.
  - A (Only Tom): 0%
  - B (Only Katie): 95%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 0%
  - D (Neither is correct): 5%

Given the straightforward nature of the algebraic manipulation required and the clarity of the expressions provided, most students should be able to correctly identify Katie's statement as accurate and Tom's as incorrect.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=0% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
