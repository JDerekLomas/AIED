## Step 1: Understanding the Task
To solve this, we need to understand what is being asked. The task is to eliminate \( q \) from pairs of simultaneous equations. The general method to eliminate one variable in simultaneous equations is to either add or subtract the equations.

## 2: Analyzing Pair 1
For Pair 1:
\[ 2p - 4q = 6 \]
\[ 7p + 4q = 9 \]
To eliminate \( q \), we notice that the coefficients of \( q \) are \( -4 \) and \( 4 \), which are opposites. This means we can add the two equations to eliminate \( q \).

## 3: Analyzing Pair 2
For Pair 2:
\[ 2p - 4q = 6 \]
\[ 7p - 4q = 9 \]
Here, the coefficients of \( q \) are the same, \( -4 \). To eliminate \( q \), we need to subtract one equation from the other.

## 4: Determining the Correct Action for Each Pair
- For Pair 1, we add the equations: \( (2p - 4q) + (7p + 4q) = 6 + 9 \), which simplifies to \( 9p = 15 \).
- For Pair 2, we subtract the first equation from the second: \( (7p - 4q) - (2p - 4q) = 9 - 6 \), which simplifies to \( 5p = 3 \).

## 5: Identifying the Correct Option
The correct action to eliminate \( q \) in Pair 1 is to add the equations, and in Pair 2 is to subtract the equations. Therefore, the correct answer is to Add Pair 1 and Subtract Pair 2.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of adding or subtracting equations to eliminate a variable. They might randomly choose an option or not fully understand the process, leading to a higher chance of incorrect answers. Given the simplicity of the required action (add for Pair 1, subtract for Pair 2), but potential confusion, let's predict: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebraic manipulations but might still be prone to making mistakes, especially if they don't carefully examine the coefficients. They might understand the need to add or subtract but could get the pairs mixed up. Prediction: A=50% B=15% C=15% D=20%.
- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to understand the method and apply it correctly. They should recognize that adding Pair 1 and subtracting Pair 2 is the correct approach. Prediction: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to not only understand but also apply the concepts efficiently. They should have no trouble identifying the correct option. Prediction: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
