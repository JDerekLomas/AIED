To solve this, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to similarity in geometry, particularly for rectangles.

Similarity between two shapes means that their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are in proportion. For rectangles, since all angles are right angles (90 degrees), the only condition to check for similarity is that the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal.

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Claim
Tom claims that two rectangles, one with dimensions 2cm by 3cm and the other with dimensions 4cm by 9cm, are similar. To check, we calculate the ratios of their corresponding sides:
- Ratio of widths: \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)
- Ratio of heights: \( \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \)
Since \( \frac{1}{2} \neq \frac{1}{3} \), Tom's claim is incorrect.

## 2: Analyze Katie's Claim
Katie claims that two rectangles, one with dimensions 4cm by 6cm and the other with dimensions 7cm by 9cm (assuming a typo and the second rectangle's dimensions are meant to be compared as given), are similar. Let's calculate the ratios:
- Ratio of widths: \( \frac{4}{7} \)
- Ratio of heights: \( \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3} \)
To compare, convert \( \frac{4}{7} \) to a comparable fraction or directly compare:
\( \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \) and \( \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \).
Since \( \frac{4}{7} \neq \frac{2}{3} \), Katie's claim is also incorrect.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with ratios and proportions. They might not even attempt to calculate ratios or might confuse the concept of similarity with other geometric properties. Given the straightforward nature of the ratios here (though requiring calculation), a significant portion might choose incorrectly based on misconceptions or lack of understanding. 
  - A (Only Tom): 20% (some might think Tom's larger numbers make it similar)
  - B (Only Katie): 15% (similar reasoning)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 5% (unlikely they both are correct based on calculations)
  - D (Neither is correct): 60% (those who either calculate correctly or have a strong intuition that both are wrong)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying concepts to new situations.
  - A: 15%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 70%

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of similarity and can apply it. They are likely to calculate and find both claims incorrect.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 85%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can also quickly assess and apply the concept to various scenarios.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 0%
  - C: 0%
  - D: 100%

The best answer is D. 
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=5% D=60%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=5% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
