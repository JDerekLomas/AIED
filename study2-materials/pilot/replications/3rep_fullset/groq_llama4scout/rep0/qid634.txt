## Step 1: Understand the quadratic formula and its application
The quadratic formula is given by \(h = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are coefficients from the quadratic equation \(ah^2 + bh + c = 0\). For the equation \(5h^2 - 3h - 2 = 0\), \(a = 5\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = -2\).

## 2: Identify the components of the quadratic formula in the given equation
To use the quadratic formula, we need to identify \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Here, \(a = 5\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = -2\). The part of the formula under the square root is \(b^2 - 4ac\), and the denominator is \(2a\).

## 3: Apply the values to the quadratic formula
Substituting \(a = 5\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = -2\) into the quadratic formula gives us \(h = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot (-2)}}{2 \cdot 5}\).

## 4: Simplify the expression
Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the formula: \(h = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 40}}{10}\), which further simplifies to \(h = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{10}\).

## 5: Further simplification
Since \(\sqrt{49} = 7\), the expression simplifies to \(h = \frac{3 \pm 7}{10}\). The denominator \(2a = 10\), and the value that replaces the star \(\bigstar\) in the formula \( \bigstar \pm \sqrt{ ? - ?  } \) should be \(3\) because it's \( \frac{-(-3)}{5} \) or simply \( \frac{3}{5} \) but since the question seems to focus on the \(\pm \sqrt{}\) part and the star likely refers to the numerator before \(\pm\), we focus on what's directly asked.

## 6: Determine the correct option
The question seems to ask what should replace the star in \( \bigstar  \pm \sqrt{ ? - ?  } \), implying the star is related to \(b\) in the quadratic formula, hence \(b = -3\), but since it's about what directly goes into the formula in a simplified view, we consider \(-3\) as it's the \(b\) value.

## 7: Analyze potential student errors
Students might confuse the signs or the positions of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the formula. However, given the straightforward nature of this question and the standard form of the quadratic equation provided, most students should be able to identify \(b = -3\) correctly.

## 8: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting into the formula or understanding the quadratic formula itself. They might incorrectly identify \(b\) or confuse the operation signs. Expect a significant spread across incorrect options.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in sign or calculation. They are more likely to correctly identify \(b = -3\) but could be confused about the presentation.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the quadratic formula and can apply it. They are likely to correctly identify the star as related to \(b\), hence \(3\) or \(-3\), with a strong inclination towards \(-3\) because that's \(b\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the formula but can also manipulate and apply it correctly. They will easily identify \(b = -3\).

## 9: Estimate percentages for each option
Given the structure of the question and typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%

The best answer is B.
