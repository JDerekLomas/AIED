## Step 1: Understand the question and the operations involved
The question involves a series of mathematical operations performed on a number \(n\): subtract 5, divide by 8, add 4, and then multiply by 7. Two expressions, one given by Jo and the other by Paul, represent these operations in a specific order.

## 2: Translate the given operations into a mathematical expression
The operations in order are: \(n - 5\), then \(\frac{n-5}{8}\), next \(\frac{n-5}{8} + 4\), and finally \(7\left(\frac{n-5}{8} + 4\right)\).

## 3: Analyze Jo's expression
Jo's expression is \(7\left(\frac{(n-5)}{8}+4\right)\). This directly matches the step-by-step operations described, following the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 4: Analyze Paul's expression
Paul's expression is \(7((n-5) \div 8)+4\). This expression implies that the multiplication by 7 only applies to the result of \((n-5) \div 8\), and then 4 is added to that result. This does not match the described sequence of operations where 4 is added before multiplying by 7.

## 5: Determine the correct expression
Jo's expression correctly represents the sequence: subtract 5, divide by 8, add 4, and then multiply by 7. Paul's expression does not correctly represent the sequence because it suggests adding 4 after multiplying by 7, which is incorrect.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the order of operations and translating word problems into algebraic expressions. They might incorrectly interpret both expressions or not understand the sequence of operations. A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebraic expressions and the order of operations. They might still make errors in interpreting the expressions but are more likely to identify Jo's expression as correct. A=40% B=15% C=20% D=25%
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are expected to have a solid grasp of algebraic expressions and the order of operations. They should easily identify Jo's expression as correct and Paul's as incorrect. A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also analyze and critique expressions for accuracy. They should have no trouble identifying Jo as correct and Paul as incorrect. A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%

## 7: Format the predictions
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
- basic: A=40% B=15% C=20% D=25%
- proficient: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
- advanced: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
