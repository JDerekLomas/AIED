To approach this question, let's analyze the statement \( n \times 5 \geq \frac{n}{5} \) and determine under what conditions it holds true.

## Step1: Analyze the inequality
The given inequality is \( n \times 5 \geq \frac{n}{5} \). To simplify, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction, yielding \( 25n \geq n \).

##2: Solve the inequality
Rearranging the inequality, we get \( 25n - n \geq 0 \), which simplifies to \( 24n \geq 0 \). This implies \( n \geq 0 \). So, the statement is true for all non-negative values of \( n \).

##3: Consider negative values of \( n \)
If \( n < 0 \), then \( 24n < 0 \), meaning the statement does not hold for negative values of \( n \).

##4: Evaluate the options
- A: always true. This would be incorrect because the statement is not true for negative values of \( n \).
- B: sometimes true. This seems plausible because the statement is true for \( n \geq 0 \) but false for \( n < 0 \).
- C: never true. This is incorrect because there are values of \( n \) (namely, \( n \geq 0 \)) for which the statement is true.
- D: Need more information. This is incorrect because we have determined the conditions under which the statement is true or false.

##5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with inequalities and algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly choose A (always true) because they don't fully understand the conditions under which the statement holds, or they might choose C (never true) due to a misunderstanding of inequalities. B (sometimes true) could also be a possibility if they vaguely recognize that it doesn't always work but can't specify when. D (Need more information) seems less likely as it's more about recognizing the need for conditions rather than computing.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and might recognize that the statement isn't always true but could struggle to articulate when it's true. They might lean towards B (sometimes true) if they understand \( n \geq 0 \) makes it true but not for all \( n \). A (always true) and C (never true) are less likely as they should have some sense of the conditions.

- **Proficient**: These students should be able to solve the inequality and understand that the statement is true for \( n \geq 0 \) and false for \( n < 0 \), leading them to choose B (sometimes true).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level would easily solve the inequality and understand the conditions for \( n \), likely choosing B (sometimes true) as they recognize the statement's validity depends on \( n \).

Given these considerations, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
