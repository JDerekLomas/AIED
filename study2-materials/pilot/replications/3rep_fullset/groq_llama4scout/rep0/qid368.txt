To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of which two integers \( \sqrt{89} \) must lie between, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to determine between which two integers \( \sqrt{89} \) lies without using a calculator. This requires an understanding of square numbers and their proximity to 89.

## 2: Identifying Key Square Numbers
Key square numbers around \( \sqrt{89} \) are \( 8^2 = 64 \), \( 9^2 = 81 \), and \( 10^2 = 100 \). This means \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \), \( \sqrt{81} = 9 \), and \( \sqrt{100} = 10 \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 44 \) and \( 45 \) - These are not square numbers that directly relate to \( \sqrt{89} \) in a simple estimation.
- Option B: \( 8 \) and \( 9 \) - Given \( 8^2 = 64 \) and \( 9^2 = 81 \), \( \sqrt{89} \) must be greater than 9.
- Option C: \( 81 \) and \( 100 \) - This range suggests \( 9 < \sqrt{89} < 10 \), which is correct because \( 81 < 89 < 100 \).
- Option D: \( 9 \) and \( 10 \) - This directly corresponds to the range between \( 9^2 = 81 \) and \( 10^2 = 100 \), which includes 89.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not recall square numbers or may not understand how to estimate square roots. They might choose A or C because they seem to offer a range, but are unlikely to accurately choose B or D due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students here should recognize that \( 9^2 = 81 \) and \( 10^2 = 100 \), making B an incorrect choice but understanding that \( \sqrt{89} \) is between 9 and 10. They are likely to choose D.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily recognize that \( \sqrt{89} \) falls between 9 and 10, making D the correct choice. They are less likely to be misled by A or B.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only know the square numbers but also be able to quickly estimate or calculate that \( \sqrt{89} \) is closer to \( \sqrt{81} \) than to \( \sqrt{100} \) but definitely between 9 and 10.

## 5: Percentage Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (random guess), B=10% (not understanding squares), C=40% (some understanding of ranges), D=30% (some intuition about size).
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80% (most understand it's between 9 and 10).
- **Proficient**: A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95% (almost all get it right).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (all get it right).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
