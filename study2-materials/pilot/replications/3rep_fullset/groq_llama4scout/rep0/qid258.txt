To approach this question, let's first analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and evaluate their correctness.

Tom says \( 15 \times 42 = 154 \times 2 \). Let's calculate both sides to verify:
- Left side: \( 15 \times 42 = 630 \)
- Right side: \( 154 \times 2 = 308 \)
So, Tom is incorrect.

Katie says \( 15 \times 42 = (15 \times 4) + (15 \times 2) \). Let's calculate both sides to verify:
- Left side: \( 15 \times 42 = 630 \)
- Right side: \( (15 \times 4) + (15 \times 2) = 60 + 30 = 90 \)
So, Katie is also incorrect.

The correct calculation for Katie's intended strategy (though incorrectly applied) would actually be \( 15 \times 42 = (15 \times 40) + (15 \times 2) \) to be relevant:
- \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) and \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \), so \( 600 + 30 = 630 \), which matches the left side.

Given this, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question tests the understanding of multiplication strategies and the ability to evaluate their correctness. Tom's mistake involves altering the numbers in a way that doesn't correctly represent the original multiplication. Katie's strategy, though mentioned, seems to misapply the distributive property.

## 2: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand or evaluate both Tom's and Katie's strategies. They might not correctly calculate or compare the values. Given the nature of the question, it's likely many would choose incorrectly, possibly A or B if they partially understand one strategy.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a foundational understanding but might make calculation errors or not fully grasp the implications of each strategy. They might lean towards Katie if they recognize a form of the distributive property but misapply it.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students can understand and apply basic mathematical operations and strategies. They should recognize both Tom and Katie's errors. They might still be tempted by Katie's strategy if they see it as a form of breaking down multiplication, but they should correctly identify both as incorrect.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the mathematical concepts but can also critically evaluate strategies. They should easily spot the errors in both Tom's and Katie's reasoning.

## 3: Predicting Responses
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (some recognize Tom's error but not Katie's properly), B=20% (partial understanding of strategies), C=10% (unlikely to see both as correct), D=40% (acknowledge both are wrong).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=25%, C=10%, D=45% (better recognition of errors).
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=10%, C=5%, D=75% (clear understanding of both errors).
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=5%, C=0%, D=90% (easily identify both as incorrect).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
