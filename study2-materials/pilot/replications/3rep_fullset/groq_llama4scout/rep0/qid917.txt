To approach this question, let's first analyze the misconception or the common error that could arise when rearranging the equation \( t=\sqrt{u+9} \) to make \( u \) the subject. The question essentially tests the understanding of algebraic manipulation and the correct application of mathematical operations to isolate a variable.

## Step 1: Understand the Original Equation
The original equation is \( t=\sqrt{u+9} \). To make \( u \) the subject, one would normally square both sides to get \( t^2 = u + 9 \), and then subtract 9 from both sides to get \( u = t^2 - 9 \).

## 2: Evaluate Tom's Statement
Tom suggests a correct first line of working could be: \( t=\sqrt{u}+3 \). This implies that \( t - 3 = \sqrt{u} \), and then squaring both sides gives \( (t - 3)^2 = u \). This is not a standard or correct first step for rearranging \( t=\sqrt{u+9} \) to solve for \( u \) directly, as it incorrectly separates the square root.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's Statement
Katie says a correct first line of working could be: \( t^{2}=u+9 \). This is indeed a correct first step. By squaring both sides of the original equation \( t=\sqrt{u+9} \), one gets \( t^2 = u + 9 \), which is a proper way to begin solving for \( u \).

## 4: Determine the Correctness of Each Statement
- Katie's statement is correct because squaring both sides of \( t=\sqrt{u+9} \) yields \( t^2 = u + 9 \), which is a valid algebraic manipulation.
- Tom's statement is incorrect as a first line because it misrepresents the original equation. The correct manipulation from \( t=\sqrt{u+9} \) does not involve adding 3 to \( \sqrt{u} \) to get \( t \).

## 5: Predict Student Responses
Given the nature of the question, let's predict the responses based on student ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not fully understand the implications of squaring both sides of an equation or could be confused by Tom's incorrect but seemingly plausible suggestion. Thus, they might be more likely to choose incorrect options. 
  - A=30% (some might mistakenly think Tom's way could work)
  - B=40% (Katie's method is straightforward and correct, but they might not recognize Tom's error)
  - C=10% (unlikely to see both as correct given the clear error in one)
  - D=20% (some might recognize both are incorrect, but this requires understanding)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple mistakes. They are more likely to recognize Katie's statement as correct but might be tempted by Tom's due to lack of deep understanding.
  - A=20%
  - B=50%
  - C=10%
  - D=20%

- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic manipulations well and can see through Tom's incorrect suggestion. They recognize Katie's as a valid step.
  - A=5%
  - B=80%
  - C=5%
  - D=10%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can easily identify correct and incorrect manipulations. They would quickly see Katie's suggestion as correct and Tom's as incorrect.
  - A=0%
  - B=90%
  - C=0%
  - D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
