To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks to compare two temperatures: \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) and \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). The correct approach is to calculate the difference between the two temperatures to determine how much hotter or colder one is than the other.

## Step 1: Calculate the difference in temperatures
To find out how much hotter \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is than \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \), we subtract \( -7 \) from \( 5 \): \( 5 - (-7) = 5 + 7 = 12^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). This means \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 12^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) hotter than \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \).

## 2: Evaluate the answer choices
- A: \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) colder than \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). This is incorrect because \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is actually hotter than \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \), not colder.
- B: \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 12^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) colder than \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). This is incorrect because \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 12^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) hotter, not colder.
- C: \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) hotter than \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). This is incorrect because the difference is \( 12^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \), not \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \).
- D: \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 12^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) hotter than \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). This is correct.

## 3: Consider potential misconceptions and student understanding
A common misconception could be confusing the direction of the temperature difference (hotter vs. colder) or miscalculating the difference. However, given that the temperatures are not extremely large or small, and the question directly asks for a comparison, students are likely to understand the concept of "hotter" and "colder" in relation to positive and negative temperatures.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic arithmetic operations, especially with negative numbers. They might incorrectly calculate the difference or confuse "hotter" and "colder". Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, potentially spread across A, B, and C, with a significant portion choosing A or B due to confusion. \( A=30\% B=25\% C=20\% D=25\% \)
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make careless mistakes or not fully understand the implications of negative temperatures. They are more likely to choose the correct answer but might still be tempted by obviously incorrect options. \( A=15\% B=10\% C=15\% D=60\% \)
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of temperature comparisons and arithmetic with negative numbers. They should easily identify the correct answer with minimal confusion. \( A=5\% B=5\% C=5\% D=85\% \)
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately and quickly. They are likely to choose the correct answer without hesitation. \( A=0\% B=0\% C=0\% D=100\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
