## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a straightforward problem involving angles on a straight line. The line is split into three parts labeled as \( a \), \( 4a \), and a right angle (\( 90^{\circ} \)). The task is to find the size of angle \( a \).

## 2: Identifying the Relevant Mathematical Concept
The key concept here is that the sum of angles on a straight line is \( 180^{\circ} \). Therefore, the equation to solve is \( a + 4a + 90^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \).

## 3: Solving the Equation
Simplifying the equation:
\( 5a + 90^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \)
Subtract \( 90^{\circ} \) from both sides:
\( 5a = 90^{\circ} \)
Divide both sides by 5:
\( a = 18^{\circ} \)

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Errors
A common misconception might involve incorrectly applying the angle sum property or misunderstanding the relationship between the angles. However, this question is relatively straightforward and does not inherently suggest a simple mistake like confusing \( 90^{\circ} \) with \( 100^{\circ} \) or similar, which could occur in more complex or differently framed questions.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with forming the equation or solving for \( a \). They might not recognize the right angle or misinterpret the relationship between the angles. Given the simplicity of the algebraic manipulation required, a significant portion might choose an incorrect answer or "Not enough information," but let's assume some will guess or misunderstand: A=30%, B=20%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic geometry and algebra. They might make simple arithmetic mistakes but are likely to understand the concept of angles on a straight line. A few might still choose D due to confusion: A=50%, B=30%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to solve the question correctly with minimal effort. They understand both the geometric concept and the algebraic process. Mistakes are less likely: A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong understanding of geometry and algebra. They are likely to solve the question quickly and accurately. Errors are minimal: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis, the predictions are:
- **below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **basic:** A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient:** A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced:** A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
