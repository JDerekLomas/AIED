To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it presents.

The question is: \( \left(3 \times 10^{4}\right)-\left(2 \times 10^{5}\right)= \)

First, let's solve it correctly:
\( \left(3 \times 10^{4}\right)-\left(2 \times 10^{5}\right) = 3 \times 10^{4} - 20 \times 10^{4} = -17 \times 10^{4} = -1.7 \times 10^{5} \)

So, the correct answer is \( -1.7 \times 10^{5} \), which matches option C.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires the student to perform subtraction with numbers in scientific notation. A common misconception could involve incorrect handling of the exponents or the subtraction itself.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
- A common error might be not adjusting the numbers to have the same exponent before subtracting. For example, converting both to \( 10^{4} \): \( 3 \times 10^{4} - 20 \times 10^{4} = -17 \times 10^{4} \) which is \( -1.7 \times 10^{5} \). This actually leads to the correct answer if done properly.
- Another error could be in the calculation or conversion, such as \( 3 \times 10^{4} - 2 \times 10^{5} = 3 \times 10^{4} - 200 \times 10^{4} = -197 \times 10^{4} \) or mistakenly calculating it directly without conversion.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( 1.7 \times 10^{-5} \) seems unlikely as it suggests a very small number result from subtracting a larger from a smaller number in scientific notation.
- B: \( 1 \times 10^{-1} \) is also not a result of simple scientific notation subtraction here.
- C: \( -1.7 \times 10^{5} \) is the correct answer.
- D: \( -1.7 \times 10^{4} \) might seem plausible but is incorrect.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students might struggle with converting and comparing exponents. They might choose A or B due to miscalculation or misunderstanding of scientific notation. D could also be an option if they incorrectly subtract without converting. C (correct answer) might be chosen by a few who understand the basics. 
  - A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- **Basic:** These students should have a better grasp of scientific notation but might still make calculation errors. They are more likely to choose C but could be tempted by D.
  - A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
- **Proficient:** Students at this level are likely to get it correct but might have a small chance of choosing D due to oversight.
  - A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Advanced:** These students are expected to handle the question with ease and accuracy, choosing C. 
  - A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
