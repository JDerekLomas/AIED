To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with the properties of rectangles.

The statement in question is: "The diagonals of a rectangle with different length sides \(_____________\) intersect at right-angles." This is testing the understanding that diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal in length, but specifically, it targets whether students know that diagonals of a rectangle intersect at right angles.

## Step 1: Recall Geometric Properties
A key property of rectangles is that their diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other. However, not all rectangles have diagonals that intersect at right angles; this specific property holds true for squares (which are rectangles with all sides of equal length) but not necessarily for all rectangles.

## 2: Identify Misconceptions
A common misconception might be that all rectangles have diagonals intersecting at right angles because some examples (like a square) do. Students might overgeneralize from familiar shapes like squares.

## 3: Analyze the Question
The question specifies "with different length sides," which directly points towards a rectangle that is not a square. For such a rectangle, the diagonals do not intersect at right angles.

## 4: Consider Student Understanding by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students might not understand basic properties of rectangles and could mistakenly think all rectangles behave like squares or have no understanding of diagonal properties.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a basic understanding of rectangles and might recall properties but could still hold misconceptions about diagonals intersecting at right angles in all rectangles.
- **Proficient:** These students should be familiar with the specific properties of rectangles and understand that only squares (a special type of rectangle) have diagonals intersecting at right angles.
- **Advanced:** Students here are expected to have a deep understanding and can reason about the geometric properties accurately.

## 5: Predict Response Percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (thinking it always happens like in a square), B=20% (not sure), C=30% (thinking it never happens), D=20%.
- **Basic:** A=20% (hold the misconception), B=30%, C=40%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=10% (some still holding misconceptions), B=20%, C=60% (knowing it never happens for non-square rectangles), D=10%.
- **Advanced:** A=0% (knowing better), B=5%, C=90%, D=5%.

The best answer is C. 

Given the analysis, here's the response in the required format:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
