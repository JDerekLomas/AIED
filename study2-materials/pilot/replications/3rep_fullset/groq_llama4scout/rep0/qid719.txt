To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of rounding \( \mathbf{3 20} 050 \) to the nearest hundred, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to round \( 320 050 \) to the nearest hundred. Rounding to the nearest hundred involves looking at the last two digits of a number. If the last two digits are less than 50, you round down, and if they are 50 or greater, you round up.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be rounding to the nearest thousand or ten, or not understanding the rule for rounding to the nearest hundred. However, this question specifically tests the understanding of rounding to the nearest hundred.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( 321 000 \) suggests rounding to the nearest thousand.
- B: \( 320 050 \) suggests no change, which could indicate a misunderstanding of the rounding process.
- C: \( 320 100 \) suggests rounding up to the nearest hundred.
- D: \( 320 000 \) suggests rounding down to the nearest thousand.

## 4: Applying Rounding Rules
To round \( 320 050 \) to the nearest hundred, we look at the last two digits, which are 50. According to the rounding rules, 50 is exactly on the boundary, and the convention is to round up. Therefore, \( 320 050 \) rounded to the nearest hundred is \( 320 100 \).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of rounding or might make careless mistakes. They could opt for A, B, or D due to confusion. Option B might be chosen by those who don't understand the need to change the number. A and D might be chosen by those who mistakenly round to the nearest thousand. C is the correct answer but might not be chosen due to a lack of understanding. 
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make simple errors. They are more likely to choose C but could still be confused by A or D. B might still be an option for those who are very confused.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the rounding concept and are less likely to make mistakes. They should predominantly choose C, with a small chance of choosing D or A due to oversight.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their understanding and application of mathematical concepts. They should almost exclusively choose C.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (rounding to thousand), B=30% (no change), C=20% (correct but challenging), D=30% (rounding down to thousand).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=15%, C=60%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
