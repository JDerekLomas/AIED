To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question step by step.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question involves basic arithmetic operations with large numbers, specifically addition and subtraction, in the context of money transactions. The initial amount in the till is \( £ 1,456 \). Then, \( £ 7,347 \) is taken and \( £ 4,377 \) is handed out. The goal is to find out how much money is left.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Calculation
To find the amount of money left, we need to subtract both the amount taken and the amount handed out from the initial amount, but considering the direction of transactions:
- The initial amount is \( £ 1,456 \).
- \( £ 7,347 \) is added to the till (taken, implying it's coming in).
- \( £ 4,377 \) is subtracted (handed out, implying it's going out).

## 3: Performing the Calculation
The correct calculation should be:
\[ £ 1,456 + £ 7,347 - £ 4,377 \]

## 4: Calculating the Result
\[ £ 1,456 + £ 7,347 = £ 8,803 \]
\[ £ 8,803 - £ 4,377 = £ 4,426 \]

## 5: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the operations (adding when should subtract, or vice versa), but given the clear context (taking and handing out), students need to understand the direction of transactions.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations or understanding the question. They might incorrectly add or subtract numbers without considering the transaction types. Option A seems too large to result from the given operations, suggesting an error in calculation or misunderstanding of operations. 
  - A: 30% (large incorrect addition), B: 20% (correct calculation, surprisingly), C: 20% (error in subtraction or addition), D: 30% (another incorrect calculation).

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic operations but might make careless errors.
  - A: 10% (large incorrect calculation), B: 60% (correct), C: 15% (minor calculation error), D: 15% (incorrect significant figure or operation).

- **Proficient**: Students understand the math concepts well and are less likely to make careless errors.
  - A: 5% (significant error), B: 80% (correct calculation), C: 5% (minor error), D: 10% (another plausible but incorrect calculation).

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the math but can also apply it accurately in context.
  - A: 0% (recognize A's implausibility), B: 90% (accurately calculate), C: 5% (considering alternative incorrect operations), D: 5% (unlikely but still incorrect option).

## 7: Providing Predictions
Given the above analysis:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
