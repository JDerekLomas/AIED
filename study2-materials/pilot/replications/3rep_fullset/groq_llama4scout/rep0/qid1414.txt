To approach this question, let's first understand the definitions and implications:

- A regular polygon is defined as a polygon that is both equiangular (all angles are equal) and equilateral (all sides are equal).
- If all angles in a polygon are equal, it implies the polygon is equiangular.
- If all sides of a polygon are equal, it implies the polygon is equilateral.

The statements:
- Tom says if all the angles are equal then the polygon must be regular.
- Katie says if all the sides are equal then the polygon must be regular.

Known facts:
- A polygon with all angles equal (equiangular) is a regular polygon if and only if it's also equilateral.
- A polygon with all sides equal (equilateral) is a regular polygon if and only if it's also equiangular.

The misconception often tested here involves understanding that having all angles equal or all sides equal does indeed make a polygon regular, because in a polygon, these conditions imply the other condition due to the geometric properties of polygons.

## Step 1: Evaluating Tom's Statement
Tom's statement that if all the angles are equal then the polygon must be regular can be considered true for polygons because a polygon that is equiangular must also be equilateral, making it regular.

## 2: Evaluating Katie's Statement
Katie's statement that if all the sides are equal then the polygon must be regular can also be considered true for polygons because a polygon that is equilateral must also be equiangular, making it regular.

## 3: Understanding Geometric Principles
In the context of polygons, if a polygon has all sides equal, it's equilateral, and if it has all angles equal, it's equiangular. Due to the inherent properties of polygons, being equilateral implies being equiangular and vice versa. This makes both Tom and Katie correct.

## 4: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to think that having just one of these properties (all sides equal or all angles equal) could make a polygon regular in some cases but not others, or to misunderstand the definitions. However, the statements made by Tom and Katie directly align with the definitions and properties of regular polygons.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
Given this understanding:
- Students below basic might struggle with understanding the terms and properties, potentially leading to confusion.
- Basic students might have a grasp of the definitions but could be tricked into thinking one statement could be false.
- Proficient students should understand that both conditions (all angles equal or all sides equal) in polygons imply regularity.
- Advanced students would not only understand this but also be able to explain why.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (thinking Tom could be right but not Katie), B=20% (thinking Katie could be right but not Tom), C=30% (intuitively thinking both could be right), D=30% (not understanding either).
- **Basic:** A=15% (oversimplifying), B=15% (similar), C=60% (getting it), D=10% (not getting it).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (aware but make a mistake), B=5% (same), C=85% (correct), D=5% (misunderstanding).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (unlikely to make basic mistakes), B=0% (similar), C=95% (confident in correctness), D=5% (extreme misunderstanding).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
