To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The curve crosses the x-axis at (1,0) and (3,0), which means its roots are 1 and 3. It also crosses the y-axis at (0,3). The general form of a quadratic equation with given roots \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) can be written as \(y = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\), where \(a\) is a constant.

Given the roots are 1 and 3, the equation can be represented as \(y = a(x - 1)(x - 3)\). To find \(a\), we use the point (0,3):
\[3 = a(0 - 1)(0 - 3)\]
\[3 = a(-1)(-3)\]
\[3 = 3a\]
\[a = 1\]

So, the equation of the curve is \(y = (x - 1)(x - 3)\).

## Step 1: Understanding the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each of the given options.

## 2: Analyzing the options
- Option A: \(y = (x + 1)(x + 3)\) has roots at (-1, 0) and (-3, 0), which does not match the given curve.
- Option B: \(y = (x - 1)(x - 3)\) matches our derived equation, so it's correct.
- Option C: \(y = (x + 1)(x - 3)\) has roots at (-1, 0) and (3, 0), not matching.
- Option D: \(y = (x - 1)(x + 3)\) has roots at (1, 0) and (-3, 0), not matching.

## 3: Predicting student responses
- **Below_basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the relationship between the roots of a quadratic equation and its factored form. They might randomly select an option or choose based on superficial similarities. Given the clear indication of the roots, a significant portion might still get it wrong due to lack of understanding. 
  - A: 25% (guessing)
  - B: 30% (some might understand roots but not apply correctly)
  - C: 20% (misunderstanding of roots)
  - D: 25% (another guess or misunderstanding)

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding of quadratics and roots. They might still make errors but are more likely to eliminate clearly incorrect options.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 60% (understand roots and can apply)
  - C: 15%
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of quadratic equations and can apply their knowledge to find the correct equation.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 80%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 10%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand but can also manipulate equations with ease. They would quickly identify the correct equation.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 95%
  - C: 0%
  - D: 5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
