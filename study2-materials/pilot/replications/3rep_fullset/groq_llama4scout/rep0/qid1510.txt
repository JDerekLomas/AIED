To solve the question and predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's first calculate the correct answer.

The calculation is: \(0.04 \times 21\)

\(0.04 \times 21 = 0.84\)

So, the correct answer is C) \(0.84\).

Now, let's analyze the potential misconceptions and difficulties:

1. **Decimal Multiplication**: Students often struggle with multiplying decimals, particularly when one or both of the numbers are small. A common error is misplacing the decimal point.

2. **Simple Multiplication**: For those who are more comfortable, \(0.04 \times 21\) can be seen as \(4/100 \times 21\), which simplifies to \(84/100\) or \(0.84\).

Given these considerations, let's predict the responses:

### below_basic:
At this level, students might not fully understand decimal multiplication or might struggle with basic multiplication facts. 
- A) \(8.4\): These students might incorrectly place the decimal point or not understand the magnitude, leading to 20% choosing this as a possibly mistaken large number.
- B) \(8.04\): This seems a bit more reasonable but still large, potentially 5%.
- C) \(0.84\): For those who somewhat understand, this could be 40%, but given the struggles, it might be lower, around 30%.
- D) \(0.084\): This might seem too small, around 5%.

So, let's approximate:
below_basic: A=20% B=5% C=30% D=45%

### basic:
Students at this level have a better grasp of multiplication but might still make errors with decimals.
- A) \(8.4\): Less likely now, around 5%.
- B) \(8.04\): Still a bit high, 2%.
- C) \(0.84\): Much more likely, around 80%.
- D) \(0.084\): Potentially 13%.

So,
basic: A=5% B=2% C=80% D=13%

### proficient:
These students are comfortable with decimal operations.
- A) \(8.4\): Very unlikely, 1%.
- B) \(8.04\): Unlikely, 1%.
- C) \(0.84\): Highly likely, 95%.
- D) \(0.084\): Unlikely, 3%.

So,
proficient: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%

### advanced:
Students here are very secure and might even use mental math or estimates.
- A) \(8.4\): Extremely unlikely, 0%.
- B) \(8.04\): Extremely unlikely, 0%.
- C) \(0.84\): Almost certain, 98%.
- D) \(0.084\): Very unlikely, 2%.

So,
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=98% D=2%

The final response is:
below_basic: A=20% B=5% C=30% D=45%
basic: A=5% B=2% C=80% D=13%
proficient: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=98% D=2%
