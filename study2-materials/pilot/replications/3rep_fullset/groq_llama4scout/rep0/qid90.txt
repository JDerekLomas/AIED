## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a quadrilateral with an angle labeled as \( p \) and asks for its size. The quadrilateral has other angles labeled: \( 120^{\circ} \), \( 70^{\circ} \), and \( 50^{\circ} \). The task is to determine the size of angle \( p \).

## 2: Recall of Quadrilateral Angle Sum
A key piece of knowledge for solving this problem is that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \( 360^{\circ} \). This is a fundamental property that students are expected to recall.

## 3: Application of Angle Sum Property
To find angle \( p \), we add the given angles and subtract their sum from \( 360^{\circ} \):
\[ 120^{\circ} + 70^{\circ} + 50^{\circ} = 240^{\circ} \]
\[ p = 360^{\circ} - 240^{\circ} = 120^{\circ} \]

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Difficulties
- A common misconception might be to think that the quadrilateral is a special type (like a rectangle or a square) based on the appearance, but the question explicitly states "Not drawn to scale," which should discourage this.
- Another potential issue could be miscalculating the sum of the angles or forgetting to subtract from \( 360^{\circ} \).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic or recall of the angle sum property. They might choose \( D \) (Not enough information) because they don't recall the \( 360^{\circ} \) rule or can't perform the calculation. Some might incorrectly choose one of the given angles. 
  - \( A = 20\% \) (guessing)
  - \( B = 15\% \) (guessing)
  - \( C = 10\% \) (guessing)
  - \( D = 55\% \) (lack of understanding or confidence)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make calculation errors.
  - \( A = 60\% \) (correct calculation)
  - \( B = 10\% \) (error in calculation or misunderstanding)
  - \( C = 5\% \) (error in calculation)
  - \( D = 25\% \) (still some uncertainty)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept well and can apply it.
  - \( A = 80\% \) (correct calculation)
  - \( B = 5\% \) (minor calculation mistake)
  - \( C = 5\% \) (minor calculation mistake)
  - \( D = 10\% \) (overthinking or minor mistake)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level can apply their knowledge accurately and efficiently.
  - \( A = 95\% \) (correct and confident)
  - \( B = 2\% \) (unlikely but possible minor mistake)
  - \( C = 2\% \) (unlikely but possible minor mistake)
  - \( D = 1\% \) (extremely unlikely)

## 6: Converting to Requested Format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
- basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
- proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
- advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
