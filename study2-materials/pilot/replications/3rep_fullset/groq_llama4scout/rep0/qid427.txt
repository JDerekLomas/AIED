## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to estimate the gradient of a curve at a specific point \( t = 6 \) seconds, given a velocity-time graph of a parachutist. The graph provides a tangent line at \( t = 6 \) that passes through the points \( (2, 31) \), \( (6, 47) \), and \( (8, 55) \). The gradient of the curve at \( t = 6 \) is essentially the gradient of this tangent line.

## 2: Identifying the Gradient Calculation
To find the gradient of the tangent line (and thus the curve at \( t = 6 \)), we can use any two points on the line. The formula for gradient is \( \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \). Using points \( (2, 31) \) and \( (6, 47) \):
\[ \text{Gradient} = \frac{47 - 31}{6 - 2} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]
Alternatively, using points \( (6, 47) \) and \( (8, 55) \):
\[ \text{Gradient} = \frac{55 - 47}{8 - 6} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]
Both calculations yield the same result, confirming the gradient is \( 4 \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
Given the calculation, the correct answer is \( 4 \), which corresponds to option D.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with calculating gradients or understanding the concept of a tangent to a curve. They might incorrectly apply formulas or choose an answer based on a misreading of the graph. Option B (46) might seem appealing if they mistakenly use the coordinates directly without calculating the gradient. Option A (0.1875) could be chosen if they incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the scale. Option C (7.66…) seems less likely as it requires a calculation error. So, \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 30\% \).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic errors. They are more likely to recognize the need to calculate the gradient but might choose A or C due to miscalculations. Thus, \( A = 10\% \), \( B = 15\% \), \( C = 15\% \), \( D = 60\% \).
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept of gradient and can apply it correctly. However, they might still make minor calculation errors. The correct answer, D, should be a strong choice. So, \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 85\% \).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of the concepts and calculate accurately. They are less likely to make errors. Thus, \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 0\% \), \( C = 0\% \), \( D = 100\% \).

## 5: Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
