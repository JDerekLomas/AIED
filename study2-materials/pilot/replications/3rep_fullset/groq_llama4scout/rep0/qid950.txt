To approach this question, let's first understand what a surd is. A surd is an irrational root of a number, particularly one that cannot be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction. For a root to be a surd, the number inside the root must not be a perfect square.

## Step 1: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( \sqrt{45} \). To determine if this is a surd, we check if 45 is a perfect square. Since \( 6^2 = 36 \) and \( 7^2 = 49 \), 45 is not a perfect square, making \( \sqrt{45} \) a surd.
- Option B: \( \sqrt{47} \). Since 47 is not a perfect square (as it's between \( 6^2 = 36 \) and \( 7^2 = 49 \)), \( \sqrt{47} \) is a surd.
- Option C: \( \sqrt{49} \). This is \( 7^2 \), making \( \sqrt{49} = 7 \), which is not a surd because it's a rational number.
- Option D: \( \sqrt{51} \). Since 51 is not a perfect square, \( \sqrt{51} \) is a surd.

## 2: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand what a surd is or how to identify perfect squares. They might struggle to recognize that \( \sqrt{49} \) equals 7, a whole number. Thus, they might incorrectly identify \( \sqrt{49} \) as a surd or randomly select an option. 
  - A: 25% 
  - B: 25% 
  - C: 20% 
  - D: 30%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of squares and roots. They should recognize \( \sqrt{49} \) as 7 but might still make errors on other options due to not fully grasping the concept of surds.
  - A: 20% 
  - B: 20% 
  - C: 50% 
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient**: These students understand what surds are and can identify perfect squares. They should easily recognize \( \sqrt{49} \) as not a surd.
  - A: 5% 
  - B: 5% 
  - C: 85% 
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of the concept and can quickly identify surds and non-surds.
  - A: 0% 
  - B: 0% 
  - C: 100% 
  - D: 0%

## 3: Conclusion
Given the analysis, the predictions are as follows:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
