To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the methods Tom and Katie used.

The question asks students to evaluate two different methods for calculating \(19 \times 8\):
1. Tom's method: \(20 \times 8 - 1 \times 8\)
2. Katie's method: \(10 \times 8 + 9 \times 8\)

Let's see if these methods are correct:
1. Tom's method: \(20 \times 8 - 1 \times 8 = 160 - 8 = 152\)
2. Katie's method: \(10 \times 8 + 9 \times 8 = 80 + 72 = 152\)

Both Tom and Katie arrive at the correct answer, \(152\), which is the same as \(19 \times 8\). 

## Step 1: Understanding Tom's Method
Tom's method uses the distributive property in a clever way: \(19 \times 8 = (20 - 1) \times 8 = 20 \times 8 - 1 \times 8\). This is a valid algebraic manipulation.

## 2: Understanding Katie's Method
Katie's method also uses the distributive property: \(19 \times 8 = (10 + 9) \times 8 = 10 \times 8 + 9 \times 8\). This is another valid algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Analyzing the Question for Potential Misconceptions
The potential misconception here could be students not recognizing that both methods correctly apply algebraic properties to find \(19 \times 8\). The question does not inherently trigger common misconceptions about multiplication or algebraic manipulations because both methods, when calculated correctly, yield the right answer.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts or understanding algebraic manipulations. They might not accurately calculate \(20 \times 8 - 1 \times 8\) or \(10 \times 8 + 9 \times 8\), or they might not recognize both as correct. Expect a high percentage of errors, possibly \(A=40\%, B=40\%, C=10\%, D=10\%\), as they might randomly select an option or choose one based on a miscalculation.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of basic multiplication but might still struggle with applying algebraic manipulations. They are more likely to calculate both methods correctly but might still make errors in calculation or in understanding which method is correct. A possible distribution could be \(A=20\%, B=20\%, C=50\%, D=10\%\), as they start to see the validity of correct methods.

- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with algebraic manipulations and can apply them accurately. They should easily recognize both Tom's and Katie's methods as correct. Expect \(A=5\%, B=5\%, C=80\%, D=10\%\), as they understand and can apply the concepts.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand but can also quickly and accurately apply algebraic concepts. They are likely to see both methods as correct applications of algebraic properties. A distribution like \(A=0\%, B=0\%, C=90\%, D=10\%\) seems plausible, with a high confidence in identifying correct mathematical reasoning.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=40% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
