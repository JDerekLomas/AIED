## Step 1: Understand the question and the content it tests
The question asks students to factorise the expression \(p^{2} - 99p\). This involves finding two numbers that multiply to \(0\) (since there's no constant term) and add to \(-99\), but more directly, it involves factoring out a common factor. The expression can be easily factorised by taking \(p\) common: \(p(p - 99)\).

## 2: Identify potential misconceptions or difficulties
A common misconception might involve trying to factor the quadratic expression into two binomials with numbers that multiply to \(0\) and add to \(-99\), but this would not yield integer or simple fraction roots easily. Another potential trap could be misinterpreting the expression as a difference of squares or trying to apply more complex factorisation techniques unnecessarily.

## 3: Analyze option A
Option A, \((p+9)(p-9)\), suggests a difference of squares, which equals \(p^2 - 81\), not \(p^2 - 99p\). This would not be a correct factorisation of the given expression.

## 4: Analyze option B
Option B, \((p+3\sqrt{11})(p-3\sqrt{11})\), also represents a difference of squares, resulting in \(p^2 - 99\). This does not match the given expression \(p^2 - 99p\), so it's incorrect.

## 5: Analyze option C
Option C, \(p(p-99)\), is the correct factorisation of \(p^2 - 99p\) by simply factoring out \(p\).

## 6: Analyze option D
Option D, "Does not factorise," is incorrect because the expression can indeed be factorised as shown in option C.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly choose A or B due to misunderstanding the factorisation process or choose D because they don't see an obvious factorisation. C seems straightforward but might be overlooked. Guesses: A=30% (misapplication of difference of squares), B=20% (similar misapplication), C=30% (correct but might not be considered), D=20% (giving up).
- **Basic:** Students here should be able to factor out \(p\), making C a likely choice. However, some might still fall for A or B. D might be chosen by those who overthink the factorisation. Guesses: A=15%, B=10%, C=60%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily identify \(p(p-99)\) as the correct factorisation. Guesses: A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** This group should not only easily factorise the expression but also quickly dismiss A, B, and D as incorrect. Guesses: A=2%, B=2%, C=92%, D=4%.

## 8: Translate predictions into the required format
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=92% D=4%
