To answer this question, let's consider how students at different ability levels might approach simplifying the given ratio \(\frac{1}{4}: \frac{1}{2}\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to simplify the ratio \(\frac{1}{4}: \frac{1}{2}\) into a form where both sides of the ratio are integers. This involves finding a common denominator for the fractions and then expressing them in a simplified ratio form.

## 2: Identifying the Common Denominator
The common denominator for \(\frac{1}{4}\) and \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(4\). So, \(\frac{1}{2}\) can be written as \(\frac{2}{4}\).

## 3: Simplifying the Ratio
Using the common denominator, the ratio becomes \(\frac{1}{4}: \frac{2}{4}\). This can be further simplified by multiplying both parts of the ratio by \(4\), which results in \(1:2\).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
A common misconception might involve incorrectly handling the fractions or not multiplying both parts of the ratio by the same factor. However, given the straightforward nature of this problem, most students should be able to simplify it correctly.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with finding a common denominator or simplifying ratios. They might incorrectly simplify or compare the fractions directly without finding a common denominator. Option D (\(1:2\)) is the correct answer, but students below basic might not get this right due to a lack of understanding of ratios and fractions. So, A=20% (guessing), B=20% (another guess), C=20% (misconception), D=40% (partial understanding or luck).
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of fractions and ratios. They should be able to find a common denominator and simplify the ratio. However, they might still make some errors due to carelessness or not fully understanding the concept. So, A=10% (simple mistake), B=10% (another mistake), C=20% (misinterpreting the simplification), D=60% (correct understanding).
- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid understanding of fractions, ratios, and how to simplify them. They are likely to get the question correct but might still consider alternative methods or verify their answers. So, A=5% (unlikely), B=5% (unlikely), C=10% (distraction or mistake), D=80% (correct).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of mathematical concepts, including ratios and fractions. They are expected to simplify the ratio correctly with ease. So, A=0% (very unlikely), B=0% (very unlikely), C=5% (extreme distraction), D=95% (correct).

## 6: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%
- basic: A=5% B=5% C=20% D=70%
- proficient: A=2% B=2% C=5% D=91%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=2% D=98%

The best answer is D. 
Below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%
Basic: A=5% B=5% C=20% D=70%
Proficient: A=2% B=2% C=5% D=91%
Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=2% D=98%
