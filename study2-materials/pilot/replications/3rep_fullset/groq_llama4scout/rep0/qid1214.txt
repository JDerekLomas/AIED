To approach this question, let's consider what makes it easy or hard for students at different ability levels and how the specific details of the equation might influence their choices.

## Step 1: Understanding the task
The task is to identify the most useful first step in solving the quadratic equation \(x^{2} - 5x = 6\). This involves rearranging the equation into a standard form of a quadratic equation, \(ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\), or completing the square.

## 2: Identifying common misconceptions and errors
Common misconceptions include:
- Incorrectly applying operations to one side of the equation without doing the same to the other side.
- Failing to recognize that dividing by \(x\) assumes \(x \neq 0\) and can lead to loss of solutions.
- Not understanding that squaring or taking the square root of both sides of an equation requires specific conditions or additional steps.

## 3: Analyzing the given options
- A: Adding \(5x\) to both sides results in \(x^{2} = 6 + 5x\), which can then be rearranged into the standard quadratic form \(x^{2} - 5x - 6 = 0\). This seems a reasonable first step.
- B: Subtracting 6 from both sides gives \(x^{2} - 5x - 6 = 0\), directly achieving the standard form.
- C: Dividing by \(x\) is not a useful first step as it loses a potential solution (\(x = 0\)) and does not help in solving the equation easily.
- D: Taking the square root of both sides is not directly applicable here without isolating \(x^{2}\) or having a perfect square trinomial.

## 4: Predicting student responses by ability level
### Below Basic
At this level, students may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not recognize the standard form of a quadratic equation or how to isolate terms properly.
- A: \(80\%\) (seems like a straightforward addition to balance the equation)
- B: \(15\%\) (recognizing the direct path to standard form)
- C: \(4\%\) (incorrectly thinking division simplifies)
- D: \(1\%\) (rarely considered due to its inapplicability)

### Basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra but might still struggle with rearranging equations and identifying useful first steps.
- A: \(60\%\) (adding to both sides seems balanced)
- B: \(30\%\) (directly achieving standard form)
- C: \(8\%\) (some might still consider division)
- D: \(2\%\) (recognizing square root as incorrect)

### Proficient
Proficient students are familiar with solving quadratic equations and can likely identify the most efficient first steps.
- A: \(20\%\) (some might consider adding, though less efficient)
- B: \(70\%\) (most recognize this directly leads to standard form)
- C: \(5\%\) (few consider division)
- D: \(5\%\) (a few might mistakenly consider square root)

### Advanced
Advanced students are likely to have a strong grasp of algebraic manipulations and solving strategies.
- A: \(5\%\) (few might consider this, knowing better options)
- B: \(90\%\) (most directly see this as the best first step)
- C: \(2\%\) (rarely considered due to obvious pitfalls)
- D: \(3\%\) (unlikely, given understanding of equation solving)

## 5: Concluding predictions
Based on the understanding of algebraic manipulations and common misconceptions:
- below_basic: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
- basic: A=60% B=30% C=8% D=2%
- proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
- advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
basic: A=60% B=30% C=8% D=2%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
