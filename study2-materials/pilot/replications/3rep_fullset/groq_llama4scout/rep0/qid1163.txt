## Step 1: Understanding the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) to eliminate \( qs \) in the given pairs of simultaneous equations.

## 2: Analyzing the pairs of simultaneous equations
For Pair \( 1 \):
\[
\begin{array}{l}
-5 p+2 q=12 \\
3 p-2 q=8
\end{array}
\]
To eliminate \( qs \), we notice that the coefficients of \( q \) are \( 2 \) and \( -2 \), which are opposites. Thus, adding the two equations will eliminate \( q \).

For Pair \( 2 \):
\[
\begin{array}{l}
-5 p-2 q=12 \\
3 p+2 q=8
\end{array}
\]
Here, the coefficients of \( q \) are \( -2 \) and \( 2 \), which are also opposites. So, adding these two equations will also eliminate \( q \).

## 3: Determining the correct action for each pair
- For Pair \( 1 \), we need to add the two equations to eliminate \( q \).
- For Pair \( 2 \), we also need to add the two equations to eliminate \( q \).

## 4: Evaluating the answer choices
Given that we need to add both pairs of equations to eliminate \( qs \), the correct answer is:
- Add Pair \( 1 \) and Add Pair \( 2 \), which corresponds to option B.

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of eliminating variables in simultaneous equations. They might randomly choose an option or misunderstand the operation needed, possibly leaning towards incorrect options like A, C, or D due to confusion. Let's assume A=20%, B=30%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebraic operations but might still struggle with applying them to eliminate variables consistently. They are more likely to recognize the need to add equations but might be confused by the specifics of the question. Let's assume A=15%, B=60%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand how to solve simultaneous equations and can apply the method to eliminate variables. They should easily recognize that adding both pairs eliminates \( q \). Let's assume A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand how to solve simultaneous equations but can also do so efficiently and accurately. They would clearly see that adding both equations is the correct approach. Let's assume A=0%, B=95%, C=2.5%, D=2.5%.

## 6: Finalizing predictions
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
- proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2.5% D=2.5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2.5% D=2.5%
