To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The graph provided shows a distance-time graph with three sections:
1. A sloped line with a positive gradient, indicating Jodie is moving away from home.
2. A horizontal line, indicating Jodie has stopped moving (constant distance from home).
3. A sloped line with a negative gradient, indicating Jodie is moving back towards home.

The question asks what the horizontal section of the graph might represent.

## Step 1: Understanding the Graph
The horizontal section of the graph represents a period where Jodie is not changing her distance from home, implying she has stopped walking.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- A: Jodie is accelerating. Acceleration is a change in velocity over time, which would be represented by a curved line on a distance-time graph, not a horizontal line.
- B: Jodie is walking away from home. This would be represented by a sloped line with a positive gradient, not a horizontal line.
- C: Jodie is walking towards home. This would be represented by a sloped line with a negative gradient, not a horizontal line.
- D: Jodie has stopped walking. This is exactly what the horizontal line represents.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with interpreting graphs and understanding the concepts of distance, time, and motion. They might be confused by the different sections of the graph.
  - A: 20% (misconception about acceleration)
  - B: 30% (misinterpreting the slope)
  - C: 20% (thinking the horizontal part means she's moving towards home, which doesn't make sense)
  - D: 30% (correct interpretation)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple mistakes.
  - A: 10% (less likely to confuse with acceleration)
  - B: 20% (still some confusion with slope)
  - C: 15% (less likely to think horizontal means moving towards home)
  - D: 55% (more likely to correctly interpret)

- **Proficient:** These students have a good understanding of graphs and motion.
  - A: 5% (unlikely to confuse with acceleration)
  - B: 10% (some might still misinterpret)
  - C: 5% (unlikely to misinterpret the direction)
  - D: 80% (most will correctly interpret)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less likely to make mistakes.
  - A: 0% (very unlikely to confuse with acceleration)
  - B: 5% (unlikely to misinterpret)
  - C: 0% (correctly understand direction)
  - D: 95% (almost all will correctly interpret)

The best answer is D. 

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
