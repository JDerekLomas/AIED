To approach this question, let's consider what makes two lines parallel in terms of their equations. Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope but different y-intercepts. The general form of a line's equation is \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the y-intercept.

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Claim
Tom claims that \(y = 5x + 7\) and \(y = 3x + 7\) are parallel. For lines to be parallel, they must have the same slope (\(m\)) but different y-intercepts (\(b\)). Here, the slopes are 5 and 3, respectively, which are different. Therefore, Tom's claim is incorrect.

## 2: Analyze Katie's Claim
Katie claims that \(y = 5x + 7\) and \(y = 5x - 22\) are parallel. Both of these lines have the same slope (\(m = 5\)), but they have different y-intercepts (\(b = 7\) and \(b = -22\), respectively). Therefore, Katie's claim is correct.

## 3: Consider Student Understanding
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of parallel lines in terms of their equations. They might confuse the slope and y-intercept or not apply the criteria correctly. Given the straightforward nature of the question but the potential for misconception, a significant portion might choose incorrectly, possibly based on a superficial reading of the equations.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of the concept that parallel lines have the same slope but different intercepts. However, they might make careless mistakes or not fully analyze both claims. They are likely to struggle more with Tom's claim being clearly incorrect and might less frequently identify Katie's claim as correct without error.

- **Proficient**: These students understand the condition for lines to be parallel and can apply it correctly. They should easily identify that Tom is incorrect (different slopes) and Katie is correct (same slope, different intercepts).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the conditions for parallel lines but can also analyze and apply this understanding to more complex situations. They should have no trouble identifying the correct answer.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (Tom's mistake might seem plausible), B=30% (Katie's seems less likely to be spontaneously identified), C=10% (unlikely to get both), D=20% (recognizing both are not correct).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=50%, C=15%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=90%, C=5%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
