To solve this, let's break down the problem and analyze the potential for student errors based on the question provided.

The question involves two spinners: one with 4 equal sections labeled 1 through 4, and the other with 5 equal sections labeled 1 through 5. The task is to determine the total number of possible outcomes when both spinners are spun together and both scores are recorded.

## Step 1: Understanding the Basics of Probability with Spinners
When dealing with spinners, each section represents an equally likely outcome. For the 4-sided spinner, there are 4 possible outcomes, and for the 5-sided spinner, there are 5 possible outcomes.

## 2: Calculating Total Possible Outcomes
To find the total number of outcomes when both spinners are used together, we multiply the number of outcomes for each spinner. This is because for each outcome of the 4-sided spinner, there are 5 possible outcomes from the 5-sided spinner.

## 3: Performing the Calculation
Total outcomes = Number of outcomes for 4-sided spinner * Number of outcomes for 5-sided spinner
Total outcomes = 4 * 5 = 20

## 4: Analyzing Potential Student Errors
- **Misconception about Multiplication Principle**: Some students might not apply the multiplication principle correctly or might misunderstand how to calculate total outcomes for combined events.
- **Counting Errors**: Students might incorrectly count the outcomes or not consider all possibilities.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of combining outcomes or might not recognize that each spin of one spinner can pair with every spin of the other. They might guess or use an incorrect method. Option A (20) seems unlikely for them to choose correctly due to potential miscalculation or misunderstanding of the concept. 
  - A=40% (guessing or incorrect calculation), B=20% (might consider combinations but incorrectly), C=20% (could think of one spinner's outcomes), D=20% (completely off).

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make errors in applying them to new situations. They are more likely to calculate but could make simple arithmetic mistakes.
  - A=60% (understanding the multiplication principle), B=20% (miscalculation), C=10% (only considers one spinner), D=10%.

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make calculation errors. They should easily recognize the correct answer.
  - A=80% (correct understanding and calculation), B=10% (minor error), C=5% (oversight), D=5%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them to complex situations. They are highly likely to get the question correct.
  - A=95% (confident in their calculation and understanding), B=3% (unlikely but possible minor mistakes), C=1% (extremely rare oversight), D=1%.

## 6: Providing the Response in the Specified Format
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- **basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
