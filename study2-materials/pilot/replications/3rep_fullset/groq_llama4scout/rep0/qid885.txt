## Step 1: Understanding the concept of rotational symmetry
Rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a shape can be rotated by a certain angle and still look the same. A shape has rotational symmetry order \(n\) if it looks the same after a rotation of \(\frac{360}{n}\) degrees.

## 2: Analyzing the shapes given
- A rectangle has rotational symmetry order 2 because it looks the same after a 180-degree rotation.
- A square has rotational symmetry order 4 because it looks the same after a 90-degree rotation.
- A trapezium typically does not have rotational symmetry, or if it does, it's order 1 (only looks the same after a 360-degree rotation), unless it's an isosceles trapezium, but still, it does not have order 4.
- A hexagon (regular) has rotational symmetry order 6 because it looks the same after a 60-degree rotation.

## 3: Evaluating the difficulty of the question
This question tests the understanding of rotational symmetry. Given that the square is a well-known shape with rotational symmetry order 4, and the other options are less likely or do not have an order of 4, the question seems straightforward. However, students might confuse the properties of these shapes.

## 4: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic:** At this level, students may not fully understand rotational symmetry. They might choose based on the appearance or might not know the properties of these shapes. Thus, they could be tempted by familiar shapes or might not recognize the square's property. 
  - A=30% (common mistake, recognizing a familiar shape but not its properties)
  - B=40% (some recognition of the square, but it's not a guarantee)
  - C=15% (not typically recognized for symmetry)
  - D=15% (might confuse with other symmetry properties)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might make simple errors.
  - A=15% (less likely to confuse with rectangle)
  - B=70% (should recognize the square's property)
  - C=5% (less likely to consider trapezium)
  - D=10% (might consider hexagon due to its symmetry)

- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of geometry concepts.
  - A=5% (unlikely to choose rectangle)
  - B=90% (should confidently choose square)
  - C=2% (very unlikely to choose trapezium)
  - D=3% (unlikely to choose hexagon)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their geometric knowledge.
  - A=0% (would not choose rectangle)
  - B=95% (very confident in choosing square)
  - C=0% (would not choose trapezium)
  - D=5% (might consider but quickly dismiss hexagon)

## 5: Assigning percentages based on reasoning
Given the analysis, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
