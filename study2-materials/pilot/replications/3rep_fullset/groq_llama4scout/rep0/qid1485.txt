## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula for distance between two points
The question provides two points, \( (1,-6) \) and \( (-5,2) \), and asks students to apply the distance formula: \( \sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}} \) to find what the second bracket equals. The points are labeled as \( (x_{1}, y_{1}) = (1, -6) \) and \( (x_{2}, y_{2}) = (-5, 2) \).

## 2: Apply the formula with the given points
To find \( \left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right) \), we substitute \( y_{2} = 2 \) and \( y_{1} = -6 \) into the formula. So, \( \left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right) = 2 - (-6) = 2 + 6 = 8 \).

## 3: Determine the correct answer
The correct calculation for the second bracket is \( (8)^{2} \) because \( y_{2} - y_{1} = 2 - (-6) = 8 \). Therefore, the correct answer is C: \( (8)^{2} \).

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception could be misidentifying \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates or incorrectly applying the subtraction. For example, if a student mistakenly calculates \( y_{1} - y_{2} \) instead of \( y_{2} - y_{1} \), they would get \( -6 - 2 = -8 \), leading to \( (-8)^{2} \) as an answer (Option A).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and identifying coordinates. They might incorrectly calculate \( y_{2} - y_{1} \) as \( -6 - 2 = -8 \) (Option A), or simply not understand the question, leading to random or incorrect choices. Expect a higher percentage of incorrect answers, possibly A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may make careless mistakes. They are likely to calculate \( y_{2} - y_{1} \) correctly as \( 8 \), but might be tempted by incorrect calculations like \( -4 \) if they mistakenly use \( x \) values or miscalculate. Expect B=10%, C=70%, A=15%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make simple arithmetic mistakes. They should accurately calculate \( y_{2} - y_{1} = 8 \), choosing C. Expect C=90%, with small percentages for other options due to oversight or miscalculation, e.g., A=5%, B=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the formula but are also less prone to errors in calculation. They will accurately choose C. Given their high level of understanding, expect a very high percentage choosing C, possibly C=95%, with minimal errors, e.g., A=2%, B=2%, D=1%.

## 6: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- **basic:** A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=3% C=90% D=2%
- **advanced:** A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=3% C=90% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
