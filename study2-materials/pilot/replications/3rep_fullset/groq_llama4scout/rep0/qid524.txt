To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding that students might have.

The equation given is \( x + y = 20 \). This is a straightforward linear equation in two variables. A common misconception or lack of understanding might involve not checking if the pairs of numbers satisfy the equation or making errors in substitution.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
Students need to substitute the given pairs of \(x\) and \(y\) values into the equation \( x + y = 20 \) to see which pair fits.

## 2: Evaluating Option A
For \( \begin{array}{c}x=10 \\ y=2\end{array} \), substituting into the equation gives \( 10 + 2 = 12 \), which does not equal 20.

## 3: Evaluating Option B
For \( \begin{array}{l}x=10 \\ y=-2\end{array} \), substituting into the equation gives \( 10 + (-2) = 8 \), which does not equal 20.

## 4: Evaluating Option C
For \( \begin{array}{c}x=8 \\ y=12\end{array} \), substituting into the equation gives \( 8 + 12 = 20 \), which equals 20.

## 5: Evaluating Option D
For \( \begin{array}{l}x=-8 \\ y=12\end{array} \), substituting into the equation gives \( -8 + 12 = 4 \), which does not equal 20.

## 6: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A common error might be not checking the equation properly or assuming a pair is correct based on a superficial glance.
- Students might also struggle with negative numbers, but in this case, the error would be in calculation rather than concept.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students might not even attempt to substitute values into the equation or might do so incorrectly. They might pick an option that looks "right" or seems easy. Option A seems like a simple, positive pair, so \( A = 40\% \), \( B = 20\% \) (because it involves a negative, which might confuse them), \( C = 20\% \) (since it's a correct solution but might not be recognized as such), \( D = 20\% \).
- **Basic**: These students should be able to substitute values but might make careless errors. They might recognize C as correct but could be tempted by A. So, \( A = 30\% \), \( B = 15\% \), \( C = 45\% \), \( D = 10\% \).
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should easily identify C as the correct answer with minimal errors. So, \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 85\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Advanced**: These students are highly unlikely to make errors. So, \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 0\% \), \( C = 95\% \), \( D = 5\% \) (maybe due to a very careless mistake).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
