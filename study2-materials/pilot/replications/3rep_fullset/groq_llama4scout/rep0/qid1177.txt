## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a table of values for the equation \(x + 2y = 8\) and asks to find the value that should replace the star (\(\bigstar\)) when \(x = 2\).

## 2: Identifying the Equation and the Task
The equation given is \(x + 2y = 8\). We need to find \(y\) when \(x = 2\).

## 3: Substituting \(x = 2\) into the Equation
Substitute \(x = 2\) into \(x + 2y = 8\), which gives \(2 + 2y = 8\).

## 4: Solving for \(y\)
Solving \(2 + 2y = 8\) for \(y\):
\(2y = 8 - 2\),
\(2y = 6\),
\(y = 3\).

## 5: Analyzing the Options
The options given are A: \(16\), B: \(3\), C: \(2\), D: \(6\). The correct answer based on the calculation is \(3\), which corresponds to option B.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting into the equation or solving for \(y\). They might confuse operations or not fully understand the equation. Given the simplicity of the algebra required, but the potential for confusion, they might be more likely to choose incorrect options. Option A (\(16\)) could be a result of incorrect manipulation, D (\(6\)) could result from \(2 \times 6 = 12\) and then incorrectly adjusting. C (\(2\)) might seem plausible if they incorrectly solve the equation. However, without strong algebraic skills, they might guess or pick an option that seems right.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple algebraic mistakes. They are likely to understand the equation but could miscalculate: \(2 + 2y = 8\) could become \(2y = 10\) (adding 2 instead of subtracting), leading to \(y = 5\), which isn't an option, or they stick with basic understanding and correctly solve it.

- **Proficient**: These students are likely to solve the equation correctly: \(2 + 2y = 8\) leading to \(y = 3\), thus choosing B.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only solve it correctly but might also quickly identify that only B fits.

## 7: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (wild guess), B=40% (some understanding), C=20% (confusion), D=20% (another guess).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=70%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 8: Finalizing Predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the question once the equation is understood, and assuming most students can substitute \(x=2\) into \(x+2y=8\) and solve for \(y\), the percentages should reflect a high success rate for proficient and advanced students.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=92% C=3% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=2% D=1%
