To tackle this question, let's analyze the pictogram and the potential pitfalls or points of confusion for students at different ability levels.

The pictogram provided represents the number of people who prefer certain flavors of crisps, with one smiley face equal to 12 people. The question asks what is missing from the pictogram.

## Step 1: Understanding the Pictogram
The pictogram shows data for Salt and vinegar, Ready salted, Prawn cocktail, and Other, with corresponding smiley faces representing the number of people: 2 faces for Salt and vinegar (24 people), 1 face for Ready salted (12 people), 3.5 faces for Prawn cocktail (42 people), and 2 faces for Other (24 people).

## 2: Identifying Potential Issues
- **A: What question was asked**: This option suggests that the question being asked (e.g., "What is your favorite flavor of crisps?") is missing. For students to recognize this as missing, they need to understand that context or the question asked is typically provided with data.
- **B: Nothing**: This option implies that the pictogram is complete as it stands. Students might choose this if they don't see an obvious missing piece of information.
- **C: A key**: A key explaining what each smiley face represents (in this case, 12 people) is given directly below the pictogram. However, the question is about what is missing, and technically, a key is present, but one might argue about its explicitness.
- **D: Other needs to say what flavour it is**: This option points out that "Other" does not specify what flavor it represents.

## 3: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with interpreting graphs and understanding what information is necessary for a graph to be complete. They might not recognize the need for a question context (A) or might not understand that "Other" needs specification (D). They could mistakenly think nothing is missing (B) or not understand the purpose of a key (C), which is already provided.

- **Basic**: At this level, students start to understand graph representations but might still struggle with abstract thinking about what makes data representation complete. They may realize that "Other" needs specification (D) but might not think about the broader context of what question was asked (A).

- **Proficient**: Proficient students are more likely to recognize that while a key is provided, the question being asked (A) is implicitly missing because it provides context. They are also likely to notice that "Other" lacks specificity (D) but are less likely to think that a key (C) is missing since it's provided.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students will likely see through the provided details and understand the graphical representation's requirements. They will recognize the necessity of knowing what question was asked (A) for context and that "Other" needs to specify its flavor (D). They are less likely to consider (B) or (C) as viable since the key is present and obvious.

## 4: Predicting Percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (some might see the lack of context), B=40% (might not see any issues), C=10% (unlikely to focus on the key), D=20% (some might notice "Other").
- **Basic**: A=20% (starting to understand context), B=30% (some still don't see issues), C=5% (key is there), D=45% (many see "Other" needs clarification).
- **Proficient**: A=40% (better understanding of needed context), B=10% (few think it's complete), C=5% (key provided), D=45% (recognize "Other" needs specificity).
- **Advanced**: A=60% (strong understanding of context needed), B=0% (recognize something missing), C=0% (key is explicit), D=40% (see "Other" as needing clarification).

The final response is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=5% D=45%
proficient: A=40% B=10% C=5% D=45%
advanced: A=60% B=0% C=0% D=40%
