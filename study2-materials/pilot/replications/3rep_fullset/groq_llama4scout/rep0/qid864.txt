To approach this question, let's analyze the equation and the graph provided, and then consider how students at different ability levels might respond.

The equation given is \(5 - 0.5x = 6\). To solve for \(x\), we rearrange the equation:

\(5 - 0.5x = 6\)

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\(-0.5x = 1\)

Divide both sides by -0.5:

\(x = -2\)

So, the correct solution to the equation \(5 - 0.5x = 6\) is \(x = -2\).

Now, let's consider the graph. The graph of \(y = 5 - 0.5x\) has a y-intercept at (0,5) and an x-intercept at (10,0). The question asks students to find the solution to \(5 - 0.5x = 6\) based on the graph. 

To use the graph, students would need to find where \(y = 6\) intersects the line \(y = 5 - 0.5x\). Since the equation \(5 - 0.5x = 6\) implies \(y = 6\), and we've solved it to get \(x = -2\), students should look for \(x = -2\) on the graph if they were to draw or imagine a horizontal line at \(y = 6\) and find its intersection with the given line.

## Predicting Student Responses

### Below_Basic
Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulation and graph interpretation. They might try to substitute values or use the graph directly without solving the equation.
- A: \(x = -2\) might seem correct if they solve it or understand the graph correctly, but given their level, they might rely more on guesswork or incorrect graph reading. **A=40%**
- B: \(x = 2\) could be a guess or a misinterpretation. **B=20%**
- C: \(x = 5\) might seem plausible if they misunderstand the equation or graph. **C=20%**
- D: \(x = 10\) corresponds to the x-intercept, not related to \(y = 6\). **D=20%**

### Basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and graphs but might make careless mistakes.
- They should be able to solve \(5 - 0.5x = 6\) to get \(x = -2\) or understand from the graph if they recognize \(y = 6\) is above the y-intercept.
- A: **A=60%** (correct solution)
- B: **B=15%** (plausible mistake)
- C: **C=10%** (less likely, as it doesn't directly relate to common mistakes here)
- D: **D=15%** (unlikely, as it relates to the x-intercept)

### Proficient
Students at this level are expected to solve the problem accurately with ease.
- A: **A=80%** (accurately solve or interpret)
- B: **B=5%** (small chance of minor mistake)
- C: **C=5%** (unlikely mistake)
- D: **D=10%** (misinterpretation of the graph)

### Advanced
Students at this level are highly confident and accurate.
- A: **A=90%** (correct, with ease)
- B: **B=2%** (rare mistake)
- C: **C=2%** (rare mistake)
- D: **D=6%** (unlikely, but possible if overcomplicating)
