## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a diagram with three intersecting lines. At one intersection point, two angles are marked: 138 degrees and 42 degrees. The angle opposite the 42-degree angle is marked as \( p \). The task is to find the size of angle \( p \).

## 2: Identifying Relevant Geometric Principles
In geometry, when two lines intersect, the vertically opposite angles are equal. This principle is crucial for solving the problem. Given that one angle is 42 degrees, its vertically opposite angle, \( p \), will also be 42 degrees because vertically opposite angles are equal.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Errors
A common misconception might involve confusing the given angles with the angle \( p \) or misapplying geometric principles. However, the question directly tests the understanding of vertically opposite angles, which is a fundamental concept in geometry.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric concepts or might not recognize the relevance of vertically opposite angles. They might be tempted by options that seem related to the given angles but are not directly derived from basic principles. Expect a higher percentage to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding or misapplication of concepts.

- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a grasp of basic geometric principles, including vertically opposite angles. However, they might still make errors if they overcomplicate the problem or misinterpret the diagram. A significant portion might correctly identify \( p \) as 42 degrees, but some might be confused by the presence of the 138-degree angle.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students should confidently and accurately apply geometric principles. They should recognize that \( p \) equals 42 degrees due to the properties of vertically opposite angles. This group is likely to have a high success rate with minimal errors.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the geometric principles but also can apply them in more complex contexts. They should have no trouble identifying \( p \) as 42 degrees and would likely not consider incorrect options.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the fundamental principle it tests:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (incorrect but plausible), B=40% (correct but let's assume some struggle), C=20% (incorrect), D=20% (not enough information, incorrect).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=98%, C=1%, D=1%.

The best answer is B. 
Below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
Basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
Proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
Advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
