To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the misconceptions it might trigger.

The question presents a diagram with an arrow pointing to the left showing -18 and 3 arrows pointing to the left showing -18 in 3 equal parts. Tom writes \(3 \times (-6) = -18\), and Katie writes \(\frac{-18}{3} = -6\). The task is to determine who is correct.

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculations
Tom's calculation, \(3 \times (-6) = -18\), implies that if you have -6 three times, you indeed get -18, which is mathematically correct.

## 2: Understanding Katie's Calculation
Katie's calculation, \(\frac{-18}{3} = -6\), implies that -18 divided into 3 equal parts gives -6, which is also mathematically correct.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve misunderstanding how negative numbers interact with multiplication and division. However, both Tom and Katie's equations are fundamentally correct given the standard rules of arithmetic with negative numbers.

## 4: Evaluating Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations, especially with negative numbers. They might incorrectly apply rules or not fully understand the operations. Given the simplicity of the calculations but the potential for confusion with negative numbers, we might see:
  - A=30% (incorrectly thinks only Tom is right, possibly misunderstanding Katie's calculation)
  - B=20% (incorrectly thinks only Katie is right, possibly misunderstanding Tom's calculation)
  - C=30% (correctly identifies both as correct, showing an understanding of the operations)
  - D=20% (thinks neither is correct, indicating a lack of understanding of both operations)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a better grasp of basic operations but might still make errors with negative numbers or fractions. They are more likely to understand both calculations correctly:
  - A=15%
  - B=10%
  - C=70% (recognize both calculations as correct)
  - D=5%

- **Proficient:** Students at this level have a solid understanding of arithmetic operations, including those with negative numbers. They should easily recognize the correctness of both calculations:
  - A=5%
  - B=5%
  - C=85%
  - D=5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the operations but can also apply them in various contexts. They are highly likely to see the correctness of both:
  - A=0%
  - B=0%
  - C=95%
  - D=5%

## 5: Conclusion
Given the analysis, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
