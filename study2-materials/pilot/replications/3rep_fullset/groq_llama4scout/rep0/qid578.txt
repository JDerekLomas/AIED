To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the quadratic expression given: \(p^{2}+2p+3\). The task is to factorize it, if possible. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Quadratic Expression
The given quadratic expression is \(p^{2}+2p+3\). To factorize a quadratic expression of the form \(ax^{2}+bx+c\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \(ac\) and add to \(b\). For the expression \(p^{2}+2p+3\), \(a=1\), \(b=2\), and \(c=3\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Factors
We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(1 \times 3 = 3\) and add to \(2\). The numbers \(1\) and \(3\) do not add to \(2\), but \(-1\) and \(-3\) also do not work as they add to \(-4\). Actually, there are no integer pairs that satisfy both conditions (multiplying to 3 and adding to 2), suggesting that this quadratic expression does not factor easily into integers.

## 3: Considering the Discriminant
Another approach to determine if a quadratic expression can be factored into linear terms with real coefficients is to examine its discriminant, \(D = b^{2} - 4ac\). If \(D < 0\), the quadratic equation has no real roots, meaning it cannot be factored into linear factors with real coefficients. For \(p^{2}+2p+3\), \(D = 2^{2} - 4(1)(3) = 4 - 12 = -8\). Since \(D < 0\), the expression does not factor into real linear factors.

## 4: Analyzing Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of factorizing quadratic expressions or might not be able to apply the quadratic formula or complete the square. They are likely to guess or try simple factor pairs. Option D (Does not factorise) might be less likely chosen as they might not fully grasp the conditions under which a quadratic does not factorise. A=30% (guessing), B=20% (incorrect factor pairs), C=20% (another guess), D=30% (acknowledging it doesn't factor but not fully understanding why).
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might struggle with applying the discriminant or might not immediately recognize the expression cannot be easily factored. They might try to force factorization. A=40% (common incorrect factorization attempt), B=25%, C=15%, D=20% (starting to understand that not all quadratics factorise easily).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the factorization process and can apply it. They know to check the discriminant to see if a quadratic has real roots. Given \(D < 0\), they should recognize it doesn't factorise into real numbers. A=10%, B=5%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are familiar with the theory behind quadratic equations, including the role of the discriminant. They will quickly identify that \(p^{2}+2p+3\) does not factorise over the reals due to \(D < 0\). A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 5: Predicted Percentages
Based on the understanding and likely errors at each level:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
- **proficient**: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
