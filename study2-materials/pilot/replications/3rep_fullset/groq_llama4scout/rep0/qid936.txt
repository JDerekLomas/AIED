To approach this question, let's consider what each option entails and how students at different levels might respond.

## Step 1: Understand the Factorisation
First, let's factorise the given expressions to verify who is correct.
- Tom's expression: \(x^{2} + 5x + 6\). To factorise, we look for two numbers that add up to 5 and multiply to 6. These numbers are 2 and 3, because \(2 + 3 = 5\) and \(2 \times 3 = 6\). So, \(x^{2} + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)\), making Tom correct.
- Katie's expression: \(x^{2} - 5x - 6\). We look for two numbers that add up to -5 and multiply to -6. These numbers are -6 and 1, because \(-6 + 1 = -5\) and \(-6 \times 1 = -6\). So, \(x^{2} - 5x - 6 = (x - 6)(x + 1)\), not \((x - 3)(x - 2)\), making Katie incorrect.

## 2: Analyze Potential Student Errors
- A common misconception is not checking the signs of the terms properly or not fully expanding the factorised form to verify.
- Students might also struggle with identifying the correct factors, especially if they are not fluent with multiplication tables or adding/subtracting integers.

## 3: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
### below_basic
At this level, students may struggle with basic algebra and factorisation. They might not correctly factorise either expression or might not understand how to verify the factorisations.
- A (Only Tom): 30% (some might get Tom's right but not understand Katie's)
- B (Only Katie): 10% (unlikely to get Katie's right without Tom's)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 5% (unlikely both are correct)
- D (Neither is correct): 55% (many might incorrectly dismiss both)

### basic
Students at this level have a grasp of basic concepts but may make simple errors.
- A (Only Tom): 50% (might get Tom's right)
- B (Only Katie): 15% (might mistakenly think Katie's is right)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 10% (some might incorrectly assume both are right)
- D (Neither is correct): 25% (some might see through both errors)

### proficient
These students understand algebra well and can apply it.
- A (Only Tom): 70% (likely to see Tom's is correct)
- B (Only Katie): 5% (unlikely to mistakenly think Katie's is correct)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 5% (know Katie's is incorrect)
- D (Neither is correct): 20% (some might quickly verify and see only Tom is correct)

### advanced
Advanced students will easily verify both expressions.
- A (Only Tom): 80% (easily verify Tom's)
- B (Only Katie): 0% (easily see Katie's is incorrect)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 0% (know both cannot be correct)
- D (Neither is correct): 20% (aware Tom is correct, Katie not)

## 4: Provide Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=5% D=55%
- basic: A=50% B=15% C=10% D=25%
- proficient: A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%
- advanced: A=80% B=0% C=0% D=20%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=5% D=55%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=80% B=0% C=0% D=20%
