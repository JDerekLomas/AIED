To approach this question, let's first analyze the problems presented and the common misconceptions or areas of difficulty students might face, particularly concerning the order of operations.

## Step 1: Understand the Order of Operations
The order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction), is crucial for solving mathematical expressions. For Problem P: \(6 \div 3 + 5\), according to BIDMAS, division should be performed before addition. For Problem Q: \(6 \div 3 \times 5\), division should be performed before multiplication.

## 2: Identify Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception is that students might perform operations in the order they appear from left to right without considering the hierarchy of operations. However, the question specifically asks which calculation should be done first in each problem, not the final result.

## 3: Analyze Problem P
In Problem P, \(6 \div 3 + 5\), students should perform \(6 \div 3\) first, which corresponds to option C and D for Problem P.

## 4: Analyze Problem Q
In Problem Q, \(6 \div 3 \times 5\), students should perform \(6 \div 3\) first, following BIDMAS, which again points towards options C and D for Problem Q.

## 5: Evaluate the Options
- Option A suggests \(3+5\) for Problem P and \(3 \times 5\) for Problem Q, which is incorrect for both.
- Option B suggests \(3+5\) for Problem P and \(6 \div 3\) for Problem Q, which is partially incorrect.
- Option C suggests \(6 \div 3\) for Problem P and \(3 \times 5\) for Problem Q, which is partially incorrect because \(6 \div 3\) is correct for Problem P but \(3 \times 5\) is not the first operation for Problem Q.
- Option D suggests \(6 \div 3\) for Problem P and \(6 \div 3\) for Problem Q, which is correct according to BIDMAS.

## 6: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might choose A or B due to confusion, but a significant portion could also misunderstand and choose C.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying BIDMAS correctly in all contexts. They are more likely to choose D but could be tempted by C.
- **Proficient**: These students understand BIDMAS well and are less likely to make mistakes. They should predominantly choose D.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand BIDMAS but also apply it accurately without hesitation. They will choose D.

## 7: Predict Student Responses
Given the clarity of the question and the straightforward application of BIDMAS:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (misunderstanding of operations), B=20% (incorrect prioritization), C=30% (partially correct but flawed), D=20% (correct but requires understanding of BIDMAS).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=10%, C=20%, D=60% (as they start to grasp BIDMAS).
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80% (strong understanding of BIDMAS).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95% (excellent grasp of mathematical principles).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
