## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to determine where brackets need to be placed in the expression \(3 \times 2 + 4 - 5\) to make the answer equal \(13\). This requires students to work backwards from the desired outcome to find the correct placement of brackets.

## 2: Evaluating Option A
Option A is \(3 \times (2 + 4) - 5\). Let's calculate it: \(3 \times (6) - 5 = 18 - 5 = 13\). This option works.

## 3: Evaluating Option B
Option B is \(3 \times 2 + (4 - 5)\). Let's calculate it: \(6 + (-1) = 6 - 1 = 5\). This option does not work.

## 4: Evaluating Option C
Option C is \(3 \times (2 + 4 - 5)\). Let's calculate it: \(3 \times (6 - 5) = 3 \times 1 = 3\). This option does not work.

## 5: Evaluating Option D
Option D suggests that no brackets are needed. Let's calculate the original expression: \(3 \times 2 + 4 - 5 = 6 + 4 - 5 = 10 - 5 = 5\). This option does not work.

## 6: Analyzing Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding the concept of brackets. They might randomly select options or choose based on a misunderstanding of how brackets work. Given the simplicity of calculations required to assess each option, they might lean towards options that seem to involve more steps or appear complicated, such as C, or might not understand the concept of making the equation equal 13, leading to a spread across options but likely with a higher percentage on D due to a lack of understanding of how to manipulate the equation.

## 7: Predicting Responses for Each Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might get it by chance or simple trial), B=15% (might try but not calculate correctly), C=30% (seems complex, might attract some), D=35% (lack of understanding, think it's fine as is).
- **Basic**: A=40% (start to understand the need for brackets and can calculate), B=20% (understand need for brackets but calculate wrong), C=20% (calculate but might not reach 13), D=20% (some still think it works without brackets).
- **Proficient**: A=60% (easily calculate and understand), B=10% (quickly rule out), C=10% (quickly rule out), D=20% (know it doesn't work without brackets).
- **Advanced**: A=80% (very confident in calculations and understanding of order of operations), B=5% (unlikely to choose), C=5% (unlikely to choose), D=10% (aware of the need for brackets).

## 8: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the understanding and calculation:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
- **basic**: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- **proficient**: A=60% B=10% C=10% D=20%
- **advanced**: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=10% D=20%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
