To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with the algebraic expressions involved.

The question requires students to evaluate \(3h^2\) and \((3h)^2\) when \(h = 10\). 

## Step 1: Understand the algebraic expressions
First, let's compute \(3h^2\) and \((3h)^2\) when \(h = 10\).
- \(3h^2 = 3 \times (10)^2 = 3 \times 100 = 300\)
- \((3h)^2 = (3 \times 10)^2 = (30)^2 = 900\)

## 2: Identify the correct statements
Based on the calculations:
- \(3h^2 = 300\) is true.
- \((3h)^2 = 900\) is true.

## 3: Compare with given options
- Option A: \(3h^2 = 300\) and \((3h)^2 = 300\). This is incorrect because \((3h)^2 = 900\), not \(300\).
- Option B: \(3h^2 = 300\) and \((3h)^2 = 900\). This matches our calculations.
- Option C: \(3h^2 = 900\) and \((3h)^2 = 900\). This is incorrect because \(3h^2 = 300\), not \(900\).
- Option D: \(3h^2 = 900\) and \((3h)^2 = 300\). This is incorrect for both statements.

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception is to confuse \(3h^2\) with \((3h)^2\), thinking they are equivalent or applying the exponent incorrectly. Students might incorrectly calculate \((3h)^2\) as \(3h^2\) or vice versa.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the difference between \(3h^2\) and \((3h)^2\), and could struggle with substituting \(h = 10\). They might choose A or D due to lack of understanding of algebraic expressions. 
  - A: 40% (incorrect but tempting due to misunderstanding of formulas)
  - B: 20% (correct, but might require more algebraic confidence)
  - C: 20% (incorrect, due to miscalculation)
  - D: 20% (incorrect, due to miscalculation)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make calculation errors or confuse the expressions.
  - A: 30%
  - B: 50%
  - C: 10%
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic expressions and can substitute values correctly. They are less likely to confuse \(3h^2\) and \((3h)^2\).
  - A: 10%
  - B: 80%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and are unlikely to make mistakes with these expressions.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 95%
  - C: 0%
  - D: 5% (might be due to a careless mistake)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=50% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
