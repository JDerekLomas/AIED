## Step 1: Understand the term-to-term rule
The term-to-term rule given is to square the current term and then subtract 4. We need to apply this rule to see which sequence it produces.

## 2: Apply the rule to the first term of each sequence to find a match
Starting with -3 as the first term:
- The rule applied to -3: \((-3)^2 - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5\).
So, the sequence should start with -3, 5.

## 3: Test each option with the rule
- Option A: Starts with -3, 9. Applying the rule to -3 gives 5, not 9.
- Option B: Starts with -3, -13. Applying the rule to -3 gives 5, not -13.
- Option C: Starts with -3, 5. Applying the rule to -3 gives 5, which matches.
- Option D: Starts with -3, 0. Applying the rule to -3 gives 5, not 0.

## 4: Apply the rule to the second term of promising sequences
For Option C, which starts with -3, 5:
- Applying the rule to 5: \(5^2 - 4 = 25 - 4 = 21\).
So, the sequence -3, 5, 21 matches the rule.

## 5: Evaluate student performance based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and may not carefully apply the given rule. They might randomly select or apply incorrect rules. Given the simplicity of applying the rule once, but potential confusion, they might be split but likely to make errors. 
  - A: 20% (random or simple mistake)
  - B: 15% (mistake or incorrect application)
  - C: 40% (correct application)
  - D: 25% (simple error or incorrect calculation)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might struggle with applying rules in sequences or make calculation errors.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 60%
  - D: 20%

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept and can apply it but might make minor errors under pressure.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 80%
  - D: 10%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are confident and accurate in their applications of mathematical rules.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 0%
  - C: 95%
  - D: 5%

## 6: Adjust according to the specific question's demands
Considering the clarity of the question and the simplicity of the calculations required, the predictions can be refined based on typical student errors and understanding.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
