To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions related to negative numbers and the specific statements made by Tom and Katie.

1. **Understanding Negative Numbers**: A key concept is that the larger a negative number is (i.e., the closer to zero), the greater it is. Conversely, as negative numbers get smaller (further from zero), they become less than other negative numbers that are closer to zero.

2. **Tom's Statement**: Tom says \( -12 > -9 \). According to the concept of negative numbers, \( -12 \) is less than \( -9 \) because \( -12 \) is further from zero than \( -9 \). So, Tom is incorrect.

3. **Katie's Statement**: Katie says \( -0.401 > -0.41 \). Here, \( -0.401 \) is greater than \( -0.41 \) because \( -0.401 \) is closer to zero than \( -0.41 \). So, Katie is correct.

Given these explanations, let's predict the performance of students at different ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic concepts of negative numbers. They might find it hard to compare negative numbers or understand the concept that a number closer to zero is larger. Therefore, they might incorrectly think Tom is correct and struggle with Katie's statement. 
  - A (Only Tom): 30% (thinking Tom is right, not understanding negative numbers well)
  - B (Only Katie): 20% (some understanding of decimals but not consistently applying it)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 5% (very limited understanding)
  - D (Neither is correct): 45% (recognize Tom is wrong but unsure about Katie or both)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors, especially with decimals.
  - A: 20%
  - B: 40%
  - C: 10%
  - D: 30%

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid understanding of negative numbers and decimals. They are likely to identify Tom's error and recognize Katie's correctness.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 70%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 20%

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concepts well but can also apply them accurately and quickly.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 90%
  - C: 0%
  - D: 10%

So, considering the predictions:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=5% D=45%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
