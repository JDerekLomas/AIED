## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation given is \( y = 3x \). The table of values provided has \( x \) in the top left, a star (representing the value of \( x \)) in the top right, \( y \) in the bottom left, and 9 in the bottom right. We need to find the value of \( x \) when \( y = 9 \) to replace the star.

## 2: Solve for \( x \) using the equation \( y = 3x \)
Given \( y = 9 \), we substitute \( y \) in the equation to get \( 9 = 3x \). Solving for \( x \) gives \( x = 9 / 3 = 3 \).

## 3: Analyze the potential misconceptions and difficulties
The question tests the direct relationship between \( x \) and \( y \) in the equation \( y = 3x \). A common misconception could be confusing the relationship or misapplying it. However, given that \( y = 9 \) and \( y = 3x \), most students should be able to solve for \( x \) as \( x = y / 3 \), which is a straightforward division.

## 4: Consider student ability levels and potential errors
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with simple algebraic manipulations or understanding the equation's structure. They might incorrectly solve for \( x \) or \( y \), possibly leading to errors in calculation or conceptual understanding.
- **Basic**: Students here should understand simple equations but might make calculation errors or not fully grasp the inverse relationship needed to solve for \( x \) given \( y \).
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve for \( x \) given \( y = 9 \) and \( y = 3x \), understanding that \( x = 9 / 3 = 3 \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only solve it correctly but also understand the implications of the equation and possibly check their work.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (misinterpreting the equation), B=10% (random or incorrect calculation), C=10% (similarly incorrect), D=60% (possibly guessing or very basic understanding leading to \( x = 3 \) when \( y = 9 \))
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=5%, C=5%, D=80% (most should get it right but a few might make simple errors)
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=2%, C=2%, D=91% (most should easily solve it correctly)
- **Advanced**: A=2%, B=1%, C=1%, D=96% (almost all should solve it correctly with ease)

## 6: Format the predictions accordingly
Given the analysis, here are the formatted predictions:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=2% D=91%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=1% D=96%

The best answer is D.
