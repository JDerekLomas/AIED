To solve this, let's first understand the concepts involved. The sample space of a probability experiment is the set of all possible outcomes. For a spinner like the one described, with 5 sections, 2 of which are labeled with a 5 and 3 of which are labeled with a 6, the outcomes are determined by the numbers on the sections.

## Step 1: Understanding Tom's Perspective
Tom says the sample space can be written as \( S=\{5,6\} \). This implies that Tom considers the sample space to consist of just two outcomes: landing on 5 or landing on 6. This perspective ignores the fact that there are multiple sections with the same number.

## 2: Understanding Katie's Perspective
Katie says the sample space can be written as \( S=\{5,5,6,6,6\} \). This suggests that Katie considers each section of the spinner as a distinct outcome, which is not necessary for defining the sample space in terms of the numbers (5 or 6) that can be spun.

## 3: Correct Understanding of Sample Space
In probability theory, the sample space should list all possible outcomes. For this spinner, the relevant outcomes are the numbers that can be landed on: 5 and 6. The fact that there are 2 fives and 3 sixes means that if we were listing every individual spin as an outcome, Katie's list would be more detailed but it essentially reflects the same probabilities for landing on a 5 or a 6 as Tom's. However, traditionally, when defining a sample space for such a spinner, we consider the distinct outcomes (5 or 6), not the individual sections.

## 4: Evaluating the Options
- Tom's \( S=\{5,6\} \) is a correct and simple way to define the sample space for calculating probabilities of landing on a 5 or a 6.
- Katie's \( S=\{5,5,6,6,6\} \) overly specifies the outcomes and implies each spin of the same number is distinct, which is not how we usually approach sample spaces for basic probability questions.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with understanding what a sample space is. They might choose A or B because they don't fully grasp the concept, but are more likely to choose B (Only Katie) because it seems to account for all possibilities, even if redundantly. \( A=20\% B=60\% C=10\% D=10\% \)
- **Basic**: Basic level students understand the concept of sample space but may not apply it correctly. They are likely to agree with Tom because they see 5 and 6 as the outcomes. \( A=70\% B=20\% C=5\% D=5\% \)
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand that the sample space should reflect distinct outcomes. They will see Tom as correct because the spinner has two distinct numbers. \( A=80\% B=10\% C=5\% D=5\% \)
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will have a nuanced understanding and recognize that both could technically be correct depending on the context (e.g., if you're modeling each individual section as an outcome, Katie's is correct; if you're just looking at the numbers, Tom's). However, for a basic probability question, Tom's perspective is standard. \( A=90\% B=5\% C=5\% D=0\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=5% D=0%
