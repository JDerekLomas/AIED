## Step 1: Understand the quadratic formula and its application
The quadratic formula is given by \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are coefficients from the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For Vera's equation \(h^{2} + 4 = 5h\), we first need to rearrange it into the standard form: \(h^2 - 5h + 4 = 0\). Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = 4\).

## 2: Apply the quadratic formula to Vera's equation
Substituting \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = 4\) into the quadratic formula gives us \(h = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4}}{2 \cdot 1}\). Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the formula yields \(h = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 16}}{2}\), which further simplifies to \(h = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2}\) and then \(h = \frac{5 \pm 3}{2}\).

## 3: Identify the components of the quadratic formula in the question
The question asks what should replace the star in \(\frac{\bigstar \pm \sqrt{?-?}}{?}\). From our calculation, \(\bigstar = 5\) (since it's \(-b\) and \(b = -5\), making \(-b = 5\)), \(\sqrt{?-?} = \sqrt{25 - 16} = \sqrt{9}\), and \(? = 2\) (since \(2a = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\)).

## 4: Analyze the potential for student errors
The question essentially tests the student's ability to identify \(b\) in the quadratic formula when the equation is given. The common misconception might be in rearranging the equation or identifying \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). However, this question is relatively straightforward because it directly asks for the value that corresponds to \(-b\) in the quadratic formula, which is \(5\).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with rearranging the equation and understanding the quadratic formula. They might incorrectly identify \(b\) or confuse the formula. Option C (\(5\)) seems correct based on our calculations, but these students might choose incorrectly, possibly picking \(A = -4\), \(B = 4\), or \(D = -5\) due to misunderstanding the formula or signs.
- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp but might still make simple errors. They should recognize \(b = -5\), hence \(-b = 5\). So, they are likely to choose \(C = 5\).
- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with the quadratic formula and can apply it accurately. They will correctly identify \(\bigstar = 5\), thus choosing \(C = 5\).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the formula but can also apply it with complex numbers and equations. They will have no issue identifying \(5\) as the correct answer.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the direct application of the quadratic formula:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
- **Basic**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=2% B=2% C=94% D=2%
- **Advanced**: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=94% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
