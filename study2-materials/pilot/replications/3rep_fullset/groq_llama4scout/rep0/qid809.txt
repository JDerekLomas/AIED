## Step 1: Understand the question and the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for making \( u \) the subject in the given formula: \( 7t - 13 = u(5 + 2t) \).

## 2: Solve the equation to make \( u \) the subject
To make \( u \) the subject, we rearrange the equation:
\[ 7t - 13 = u(5 + 2t) \]
Divide both sides by \( 5 + 2t \):
\[ u = \frac{7t - 13}{5 + 2t} \]
So, the correct answer is B.

## 3: Analyze the difficulty and potential misconceptions
This question tests the ability to rearrange a formula to make a specific variable the subject. A common misconception might be to incorrectly distribute or not properly isolate \( u \). However, given the straightforward nature of the algebraic manipulation required, most students who have a basic understanding of algebra should be able to solve it.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and could easily choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding of how to rearrange equations. They might mistakenly try to solve for \( t \) or incorrectly manipulate the equation, leading to a higher chance of choosing A, C, or D.
- **Basic**: Students with basic algebraic skills should recognize the need to divide by \( 5 + 2t \) to isolate \( u \), but might still make mistakes if they're not careful with the signs or the order of operations. They are likely to choose B but might have a significant percentage choosing A or D due to miscalculations.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should easily rearrange the equation to find \( u \) and are less likely to choose incorrect options. They should predominantly choose B.
- **Advanced**: These students should not only easily solve the equation but also be aware of common algebraic pitfalls, making them even more likely to choose B and avoid A, C, and D.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each ability level
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below_basic**: A=40% (mistaken simple rearrangement), B=30% (get it right by chance or basic understanding), C=15% (inverse operation mistake), D=15% (incorrect manipulation).
- **Basic**: A=20% (simple mistake), B=60% (correct but might struggle), C=5% (less likely to make inverse mistake), D=15% (miscalculation).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (rare mistake), B=90% (correct), C=2% (unlikely mistake), D=3% (miscalculation).
- **Advanced**: A=1% (very rare mistake), B=98% (correct), C=0.5% (extremely unlikely), D=0.5% (very rare miscalculation).

## 6: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
