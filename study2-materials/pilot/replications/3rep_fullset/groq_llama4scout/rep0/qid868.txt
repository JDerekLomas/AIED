To approach this question, let's first understand Ron's method for calculating \(46 + 28\) mentally: 
1. He adds 20 to 46, getting 66.
2. Then, he adds the remaining 8 to 66, getting 74.

Applying this method to \(37 + 56\), we break down 56 into 50 and 6:
1. First, add 50 to 37, which equals 87.
2. Then, add the remaining 6 to 87, which equals 93.

So, the correct steps according to Ron's method for \(37 + 56\) would be:
- \(37 + 50 = 87\)
- \(87 + 6 = 93\)

This matches option B.

Now, let's analyze the potential for errors at different ability levels:

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to understand and apply a specific mental math strategy used by Ron. The strategy involves breaking down one of the numbers into easier-to-handle parts (e.g., 28 into 20 and 8) and then performing the addition in steps.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions and Errors
A common misconception or error could involve incorrectly breaking down the numbers or not applying the strategy consistently. For example, adding the wrong parts together or not completing the calculation correctly.

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A suggests adding 6 to 37 and then adding 50 to that result, which does not align with Ron's strategy.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C involves a more complex and incorrect breakdown, adding 50 to 30 (part of 37) and then 7 (part of 37) to 6 (part of 56), which does not match Ron's described method.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D also does not follow Ron's strategy correctly, as it starts by adding 7 and 6, then adding 30, and finally adding 50.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the basic addition facts and understanding the strategy. They might randomly select an option or choose one that seems simplest, even if incorrect. A=40% (seems like an easy incorrect option), B=20% (correct but might be hard to understand), C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might not fully grasp the strategy or apply it correctly. They might understand the basic addition but struggle with the decomposition. A=30%, B=40% (correct and understandable), C=15%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the addition strategy and can apply it. They are likely to choose the correct option. A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the strategy but can also explain and apply it efficiently. They would easily identify the correct option. A=5%, B=90%, C=2.5%, D=2.5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2.5% D=2.5%
