## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question asks for the height of a rectangle given the coordinates of two of its corners: (-4,7) and (2,-12). The height can be determined by finding the vertical distance between the two points.

## 2: Identifying the relevant coordinates for height calculation
The height of the rectangle is the vertical distance between the points. This can be calculated by taking the difference in the y-coordinates of the two given points: \(7 - (-12)\).

## 3: Calculating the height
To find the height: \(7 - (-12) = 7 + 12 = 19\).

## 4: Analyzing potential misconceptions and difficulty levels
- The question might seem straightforward, but students could mistakenly calculate the difference or incorrectly identify the coordinates relevant to the height.
- A common misconception could be calculating the distance incorrectly or using the wrong coordinates.

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with coordinate geometry and calculating distances. They might incorrectly calculate the height or confuse the coordinates, leading to random or incorrect answers. Option D (19) is the correct answer, so students who understand the concept at all will be drawn to it, but errors in calculation might lead to A, B, or C being chosen.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are more likely to choose the correct answer, D (19), but there's a chance for errors leading to A, B, or C.
- **Proficient**: These students understand coordinate geometry well and are less likely to make mistakes in calculating the height. They should predominantly choose D (19).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of the concepts and are unlikely to make errors. They will almost certainly choose D (19).

## 6: Estimating percentages for each option at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55% (Many might guess or calculate incorrectly)
- **Basic**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85% (Most understand the concept but a few make mistakes)
- **Proficient**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100% (Understand the concept well)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100% (No errors expected)

## 7: Adjusting to the required format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
- basic: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- proficient: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The best answer is below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
