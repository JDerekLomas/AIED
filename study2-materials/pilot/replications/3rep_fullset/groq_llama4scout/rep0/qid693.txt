## Step 1: Understand the question
The question requires solving a simple linear equation to find the value that replaces the star: \(\bigstar - 26 = 28\).

## 2: Solve the equation
To solve for \(\bigstar\), we add 26 to both sides of the equation: \(\bigstar = 28 + 26\).

## 3: Calculate the solution
\(\bigstar = 54\).

## 4: Analyze the options
The correct answer is \(A = 54\). The other options are \(B = 2\), \(C = -2\), and \(D = 44\).

## 5: Consider common misconceptions or errors
A common error could be not adding 26 to both sides correctly or misinterpreting the equation. However, given the simplicity of the equation and the numbers involved, most students who understand basic algebra should be able to solve it correctly.

## 6: Predict student responses by ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not understand how to isolate the variable or could make calculation errors. It's likely that some would choose an option that doesn't require much calculation, like \(B = 2\) or \(C = -2\), or simply not know. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 40\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 20\%\).
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebra but might still make some careless errors. The correct answer \(A = 54\) should be identifiable, but some might confuse operations or miscalculate. \(A = 60\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebra and should easily solve the equation. Mistakes should be minimal. \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 2\%\), \(D = 3\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very confident in their algebraic abilities. They should all get the correct answer. \(A = 98\%\), \(B = 1\%\), \(C = 0.5\%\), \(D = 0.5\%\).

## 7: Format the predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
- advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
