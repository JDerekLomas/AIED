To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \(6 - (-8) =\), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to subtracting negative numbers.

The question requires the application of the rule that subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding a positive number. Therefore, \(6 - (-8) = 6 + 8 = 14\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception when dealing with negative numbers is that subtracting a negative number results in a negative answer or that the operation is equivalent to subtracting a positive number, rather than adding a positive number.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(14\) (Correct answer)
- Option B: \(-14\) (Incorrect, possibly from misapplying rules or calculation error)
- Option C: \(2\) (Incorrect, not related to common errors with negative numbers)
- Option D: \(-2\) (Incorrect, not related to common errors with negative numbers)

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic operations involving negative numbers. They might not fully understand the concept of subtracting a negative number being similar to adding. Therefore, they could be more likely to choose incorrect options due to confusion.
  - A: \(40\%\) (some might get it right due to luck or simple calculation)
  - B: \(30\%\) (common mistake of treating as \(6 - 8\))
  - C: \(15\%\) (random guess or partial understanding)
  - D: \(15\%\) (random guess or partial understanding)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make mistakes with negative numbers.
  - A: \(60\%\) (understand the basic concept)
  - B: \(25\%\) (still prone to simple errors)
  - C: \(10\%\) (less likely but possible)
  - D: \(5\%\) (unlikely)

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of mathematical operations including those with negative numbers.
  - A: \(80\%\) (clear understanding)
  - B: \(15\%\) (occasional lapses)
  - C: \(3\%\) (very unlikely)
  - D: \(2\%\) (very unlikely)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their mathematical abilities and are less likely to make careless mistakes.
  - A: \(95\%\) (strong understanding and application)
  - B: \(3\%\) (rare mistakes)
  - C: \(1\%\) (extremely unlikely)
  - D: \(1\%\) (extremely unlikely)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
