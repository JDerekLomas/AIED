To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question presents a graph showing the amount of potatoes consumed by a restaurant in a week and asks for the difference in potato consumption between Sunday and Saturday. The graph is not provided, but we can infer that to answer this question correctly, a student needs to:

1. Understand the question and identify the relevant data points.
2. Read the values for Saturday and Sunday from the graph.
3. Calculate the difference in consumption between Sunday and Saturday.

The common misconception this question might be designed to test is the ability to accurately read data from a graph and perform a simple subtraction. However, without the actual graph, we must consider general tendencies:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with reading values from a graph accurately or with performing the subtraction. They might not even attempt to solve it or might misinterpret the graph entirely.
  - A (35 kg): 10% (guessing or incorrect calculation)
  - B (25 kg): 15% (another guess or different incorrect calculation)
  - C (2 kg): 20% (nearly correct but significantly off, possibly due to misreading the graph)
  - D (10 kg): 55% (closest to a simple, plausible difference, might be guessed if they attempt a calculation)

- **Basic**: Students here have foundational skills but might still make errors in reading the graph or in calculation.
  - A (35 kg): 5% (unlikely to choose a far-off answer)
  - B (25 kg): 10% (could be a miscalculation)
  - C (2 kg): 15% (small difference might seem plausible if they misread the graph)
  - D (10 kg): 70% (likely to get it right or make a small mistake)

- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand the graph and perform the calculation accurately.
  - A (35 kg): 2% (unlikely mistake)
  - B (25 kg): 5% (small chance of miscalculation)
  - C (2 kg): 5% (unlikely but possible if they misread)
  - D (10 kg): 88% (most likely to answer correctly)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to be highly accurate.
  - A (35 kg): 1% (very unlikely)
  - B (25 kg): 2% (small chance of error)
  - C (2 kg): 2% (small chance)
  - D (10 kg): 95% (very likely to answer correctly)

Given the nature of the question, without the specific graph details, these predictions lean towards general tendencies in mathematical and graphical literacy:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=20% D=55%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=5% D=88%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=2% D=95%
