## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question provides two points and their midpoint on a coordinate plane. One point is given as (1,7), the midpoint is (-1, 0.5), and the third point is (star, triangle). The task is to find the y-coordinate of the third point, denoted as triangle ($\Delta$).

## 2: Midpoint Formula
The midpoint formula in two dimensions is given by:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
\]
where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.

## 3: Applying the Midpoint Formula
Let the unknown point be $(x, y)$. We have:
- One point: $(1, 7)$
- Midpoint: $(-1, 0.5)$
- Unknown point: $(x, y)$

Using the midpoint formula:
\[
-1 = \frac{1 + x}{2}
\]
\[
0.5 = \frac{7 + y}{2}
\]

## 4: Solving for $x$ and $y$
Solving the equation for $x$:
\[
-2 = 1 + x
\]
\[
x = -3
\]

Solving the equation for $y$:
\[
1 = 7 + y
\]
\[
y = -6
\]

## 5: Identifying the Correct Answer
The $y$-coordinate of the unknown point, which is $\Delta$, is $-6$. Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\Delta = -6
\]

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of midpoint and applying the formula. They might not correctly solve for $y$ or might confuse the coordinates. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, potentially spread across A, B, C, and D, but with a significant portion possibly choosing A or B due to simple arithmetic errors.

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of the midpoint formula but might make calculation errors. They are likely to understand the concept but could struggle with the algebra. Expect a significant portion to choose B ($ \Delta=-6 $), with some choosing A or C due to minor calculation mistakes.

- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with the midpoint formula and algebraic manipulations. They should easily solve for $y$ and identify $\Delta = -6$. Expect a high percentage to choose B.

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the formula but can also apply it efficiently. They are likely to get the correct answer without hesitation. Expect a very high percentage to choose B.

## 7: Assigning Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
- **Basic**: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%

The best answer is B.
