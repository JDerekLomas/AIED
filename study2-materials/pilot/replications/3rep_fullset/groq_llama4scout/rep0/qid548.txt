## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to find \( 60 \mathrm{~m} \) as a percentage of \( 2 \mathrm{~km} \). To solve this, students need to convert both measurements to the same unit and then calculate the percentage.

## 2: Conversion and Calculation
First, convert \( 2 \mathrm{~km} \) to meters: \( 2 \mathrm{~km} = 2000 \mathrm{~m} \).
Then, calculate \( 60 \mathrm{~m} \) as a percentage of \( 2000 \mathrm{~m} \) using the formula: \( \left( \frac{60}{2000} \right) \times 100\% = 3\% \).

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect unit conversions or misapplying the percentage formula. However, the question's structure suggests a straightforward calculation once units are converted.

## 4: Analyzing Option Attractiveness
- Option A (\( 333 \% \)) seems too high and might appeal to students who misunderstand the relationship between the numbers or miscalculate significantly.
- Option B (\( 30 \% \)) could attract students who incorrectly calculate or forget to convert units properly.
- Option C (\( 3 \% \)) is the correct answer, based on the calculation \( \left( \frac{60}{2000} \right) \times 100\% = 3\% \).
- Option D (\( 60 \% \)) might seem plausible to students who incorrectly assume \( 60 \mathrm{~m} \) is \( 60\% \) of \( 100 \mathrm{~m} \) or similar, not accounting for the actual values given.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with unit conversions and percentage calculations. They might choose A or D due to a lack of understanding or miscalculation. B might also be chosen by those who can do some basic percentage calculations but not accurately convert units or apply them.
- **Basic:** Students here might understand the concept but struggle with applying it accurately. They could choose B or D due to simple miscalculations.
- **Proficient:** These students should understand both conversions and percentages. They are likely to choose C, with a small chance of choosing B or D due to minor slips.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to handle the question with ease, confidently choosing C.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (overestimation), B=30% (simple error), C=20% (getting it right by chance), D=30% (another error).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=20%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The best answer is C.
