To solve this, let's first understand the content and then predict the student responses based on their ability levels.

The question asks for the probability of getting a 1 on both spinners. The first spinner has numbers 1-4, and the second spinner has numbers 1-5. 

The probability of getting a 1 on the first spinner is \(\frac{1}{4}\) because there is 1 favorable outcome (landing on 1) out of 4 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4). 

The probability of getting a 1 on the second spinner is \(\frac{1}{5}\) because there is 1 favorable outcome (landing on 1) out of 5 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

Since the spinners are independent of each other, the probability of getting a 1 on both spinners is the product of the probabilities of each event: \(\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{20}\).

Let's analyze the options given:
- A: \(\frac{1}{9}\)
- B: \(\frac{1}{20}\)
- C: \(\frac{2}{9}\)
- D: \(\frac{2}{20} = \frac{1}{10}\)

The correct answer is B: \(\frac{1}{20}\).

## Predictions by Ability Level:

### below_basic:
Students at this level might struggle with understanding probabilities, fractions, or calculating the outcome of two independent events. They might confuse the calculation or not understand the concept of multiplying probabilities for independent events.
- A: 20% (guessing or misunderstanding)
- B: 40% (some might get it right through luck or simple understanding)
- C: 15% (misconception or calculation error)
- D: 25% (alternative incorrect calculation)

### basic:
Students at this level have a basic understanding of fractions and probability but might make calculation errors or not apply the correct formula.
- A: 10% (misunderstanding)
- B: 60% (understand the concept and calculate correctly)
- C: 10% (error in calculation or concept)
- D: 20% (simple miscalculation)

### proficient:
Students at this level understand the concept of probability and can apply it to simple problems. They are less likely to make errors in calculation.
- A: 5% (rare mistake)
- B: 80% (correct understanding and calculation)
- C: 5% (unlikely error)
- D: 10% (minor calculation mistake)

### advanced:
Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also apply it to more complex scenarios. They are highly unlikely to make errors.
- A: 0% (no chance of this error)
- B: 95% (confident in correct calculation)
- C: 0% (no chance of this error)
- D: 5% (very rare mistake)
