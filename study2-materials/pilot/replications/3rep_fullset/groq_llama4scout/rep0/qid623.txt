## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to understand a function machine and apply it to solve a given problem. The problem statement is: "I think of a number, subtract 2, triple it, and the answer is \( 12 \)." The function machine has an input box, a box with a purple star in it (indicating an operation to be determined), and an output box.

## 2: Translating the Problem into Mathematical Expressions
The operations described can be translated into a mathematical expression as follows: If \(x\) is the number thought of, then the operations in sequence are \(x - 2\) (subtract 2), and then \(3(x - 2)\) (triple it), resulting in \(12\). So, \(3(x - 2) = 12\).

## 3: Solving for \(x\)
To solve \(3(x - 2) = 12\), first divide both sides by 3: \(x - 2 = 4\). Then, add 2 to both sides: \(x = 6\).

## 4: Analyzing the Function Machine
The function machine is set up as: Input \(\rightarrow\) ? \(\rightarrow\) Output. Given the sequence of operations (subtract 2, then triple), the blank box with the star should represent the operation that, when applied to the input, results in the output of \(12\) after the second operation.

## 5: Determining the Correct Option
- Option A (\(x\)): This is just the input, not an operation.
- Option B (\(-2\)): This would represent subtracting 2, which is the first operation.
- Option C (\(\times 3\)): This represents tripling, which is the second operation.
- Option D (\(12\)): This is the result, not an operation.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the sequence of operations or translating the problem into a mathematical expression. They might choose \(B\) (\(-2\)) because it's mentioned first in the problem, or \(D\) (\(12\)) because it's the final result. \(A\) (\(x\)) could also be chosen as it relates to the starting point. \(C\) (\(\times 3\)) might be less likely to be chosen because it requires understanding of the sequence of operations.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a better grasp of sequences of operations. They might still make mistakes, such as choosing \(B\) or \(A\), but \(C\) (\(\times 3\)) should become a more appealing choice as it directly relates to one of the described operations.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily understand the problem and the operations. They should recognize that the operation to replace the star is \(\times 3\), making \(C\) the correct choice.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only understand the operations but also quickly identify the correct sequence and option. They are likely to choose \(C\) (\(\times 3\)) confidently.

## 7: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (input, but not clear operation), B=40% (first operation mentioned), C=20% (understanding of tripling), D=20% (result, not an operation).
- **Basic**: A=10% (less likely to just pick input), B=30% (still a common first operation), C=50% (recognizing tripling), D=10% (result).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (understand sequence), B=10% (unlikely to mistake), C=80% (correct operation), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (clear understanding), B=5% (very unlikely), C=95% (correct), D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
