To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question presents a pictogram where each smiley face represents 10 people. The number of smiley faces for each game is given as: Game 1 = 5 faces, Game 2 = 2 faces, Game 3 = 3 faces, Game 4 = 2 faces. To find the mean number of people at each game, we first need to calculate the total number of people and then divide by the number of games.

## Step 1: Calculate the total number of people across all games.
- Game 1: 5 faces * 10 people/face = 50 people
- Game 2: 2 faces * 10 people/face = 20 people
- Game 3: 3 faces * 10 people/face = 30 people
- Game 4: 2 faces * 10 people/face = 20 people
Total people = 50 + 20 + 30 + 20 = 120 people

## 2: Calculate the mean number of people per game.
There are 4 games, so the mean = Total people / Number of games = 120 / 4 = 30 people

## 3: Analyze potential student responses based on the calculation.
- The correct answer is B: 30.
- Option A (3) might be chosen by students who incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the scale of the pictogram.
- Option C (10) could be selected by students who think each game had the same number of people as represented by one smiley face or misunderstand the calculation.
- Option D (120) might be chosen by students who simply state the total number of people without dividing by the number of games.

## 4: Predict student responses by ability level.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the pictogram, calculating totals, or dividing. They might choose A, C, or D due to a lack of understanding of how to interpret the pictogram or perform the calculations.
  - A = 20% (misinterpretation of pictogram scale)
  - B = 10% (correct but unlikely due to calculation difficulties)
  - C = 30% (misunderstanding of pictogram representation)
  - D = 40% (stating total instead of mean)

- **Basic:** Students here have foundational skills but might make calculation errors or misunderstand the question.
  - A = 15% (simple miscalculation)
  - B = 40% (correct calculation)
  - C = 25% (confusing face value with game value)
  - D = 20% (total instead of mean)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts and can calculate but might be distracted by seemingly simple answers.
  - A = 5% (unlikely but possible mistake)
  - B = 80% (correct calculation)
  - C = 10% (minor misunderstanding)
  - D = 5% (unlikely but possible error)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly unlikely to make basic calculation errors.
  - A = 0% (virtually no chance of this mistake)
  - B = 95% (correct calculation expected)
  - C = 0% (unlikely mistake)
  - D = 5% (very unlikely but possible if misreading question)

The best answer is B. 

Predicting the exact percentages can be challenging without specific data, but based on typical student performance:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
