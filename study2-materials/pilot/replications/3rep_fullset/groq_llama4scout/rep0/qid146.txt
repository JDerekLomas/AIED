To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given fraction \(\frac{3}{5}\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks students to verbalize the fraction \(\frac{3}{5}\). The correct verbalization is "three fifths." Misconceptions might arise from confusion with decimal notation or incorrect ordering of the numerator and denominator in verbal form.

- **Option A (Three point five):** This is a common misconception when students confuse the fraction \(\frac{3}{5}\) with the decimal 3.5. However, this confusion is more likely when the question directly involves conversion to decimals or when the context suggests a decimal.
  
- **Option B (Three fives):** This option might seem plausible to students who are not secure in their understanding of how to express fractions verbally, particularly if they are used to seeing numbers in a different context (like coordinates or measurements).

- **Option C (Three fifths):** This is the correct answer. Students secure in their understanding of fractions should easily recognize this.

- **Option D (Third fifths):** This option tests a specific misconception where students might mistakenly insert "third" as if it were an ordinal number associated with the denominator or misuse it in place of "three."

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic fraction terminology. 
  - **A=40%** (confusing with 3.5, a common error when mixing number forms)
  - **B=20%** (simple misreading or confusion)
  - **C=30%** (some understanding of fraction vocabulary)
  - **D=10%** (misordering or misusing terms)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors.
  - **A=20%** (less likely to confuse with decimal but still possible)
  - **B=10%** (less confusion with basic terms)
  - **C=60%** (correct understanding of fraction terms)
  - **D=10%** (some still misuse terms)

- **Proficient:** Students at this level are more secure in their understanding.
  - **A=5%** (unlikely to confuse with decimal)
  - **B=5%** (unlikely to misread terms)
  - **C=85%** (strong understanding of verbalizing fractions)
  - **D=5%** (rarely misuse terms)

- **Advanced:** These students have a deep and flexible understanding.
  - **A=0%** (unlikely to confuse with decimal or misinterpret)
  - **B=0%** (secure in fraction vocabulary)
  - **C=95%** (very strong understanding)
  - **D=5%** (extremely rare error)

So, the response in the requested format:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
