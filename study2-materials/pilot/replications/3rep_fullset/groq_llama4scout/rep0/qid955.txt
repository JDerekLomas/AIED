To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question requires students to find the difference in water depth between the first minute and the third minute based on a given graph. The points on the graph are: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 6), (4, 9), (5, 10).

## Step 1: Understanding the Graph
The graph shows a non-linear increase in water depth over time. At 1 minute, the water depth is 1 cm, and at 3 minutes, the water depth is 6 cm.

## 2: Calculating the Difference
To find the difference between the first minute and the third minute, we subtract the depth at 1 minute from the depth at 3 minutes: \(6 \, \text{cm} - 1 \, \text{cm} = 5 \, \text{cm}\).

## 3: Identifying Potential Errors
A common misconception could be misreading the graph or miscalculating the difference. However, the question seems straightforward, and the graph is simple.

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(5\)
- Option B: \(6 \, \text{cm}\)
- Option C: \(5 \, \text{cm}\)
- Option D: \(2 \, \text{cm}\)

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with reading the graph or understanding the concept of difference. They might choose an option that seems to match a simple miscalculation or misreading. Option D (\(2 \, \text{cm}\)) could be a guess, but without clear calculation skills, they might also pick A or B due to not understanding the question properly. However, given the direct nature of the question, most might still manage to calculate or estimate correctly, leaning towards C (\(5 \, \text{cm}\)) or incorrectly towards A or B.
- **Basic:** Students here should be able to read the graph and calculate the difference. The correct answer, C (\(5 \, \text{cm}\)), should be chosen by most. A few might confuse the numbers or miscalculate, leading to A, B, or D, but the majority should get it right.
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to understand the graph and calculate the difference accurately. They should predominantly choose C (\(5 \, \text{cm}\)), with very few errors.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level will easily and accurately calculate the difference. They should almost exclusively choose C (\(5 \, \text{cm}\)), with minimal to no errors.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=15% (guess or miscalculation), B=10% (incorrect interpretation), C=60% (correct, despite struggles), D=15% (another guess).
- **Basic:** A=5% (simple mistake), B=5% (misinterpretation), C=85% (correct calculation), D=5% (error).
- **Proficient:** A=2% (minor mistake), B=2% (rare misinterpretation), C=94% (accurate calculation), D=2% (unlikely error).
- **Advanced:** A=1% (extremely rare mistake), B=1% (very rare), C=97% (accurate), D=1% (very unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=94% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
