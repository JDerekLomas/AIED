To solve this, let's first understand the question and the potential misconceptions it might elicit.

The question provides a table of values for \(y = x^2\), with \(y = 4\) and asks to determine if the star (representing \(x\)) could be \(16\) (according to Jo) or \(-2\) (according to Paul).

## Step 1: Understand the equation \(y = x^2\)
The equation \(y = x^2\) means that for any value of \(x\), \(y\) will be the square of \(x\). This implies that \(y\) is always positive (or zero), because squaring any real number always results in a non-negative number.

## 2: Analyze Jo's claim
Jo says the star (representing \(x\)) could be \(16\). If \(x = 16\), then \(y = 16^2 = 256\), not \(4\). So, Jo is incorrect.

## 3: Analyze Paul's claim
Paul says the star could be \(-2\). If \(x = -2\), then \(y = (-2)^2 = 4\). This matches the given \(y\) value, so Paul is correct.

## 4: Determine the correctness of each statement
- Jo is incorrect because \(16^2 = 256\), not \(4\).
- Paul is correct because \((-2)^2 = 4\).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) in \(y = x^2\) or might not be able to evaluate the claims correctly. They might mistakenly think both could be correct or both incorrect due to a lack of understanding. However, given the straightforward nature of the calculation, some might still get it right by chance or intuition. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 30\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 30\%\).
- **Basic**: At this level, students understand the basic concept of \(y = x^2\) but might still make errors in applying it, especially if they haven't solidified the understanding that \(x\) can be negative. They might incorrectly think Jo could be right or struggle with the concept of negative \(x\). \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 60\%\).
- **Proficient**: Students here have a good grasp of \(y = x^2\), understanding both positive and negative \(x\) values can give the same \(y\). They should recognize Paul's correctness and Jo's incorrectness. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 80\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the equation but can also easily evaluate the claims. They should quickly identify Paul as correct and Jo as incorrect. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 90\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
