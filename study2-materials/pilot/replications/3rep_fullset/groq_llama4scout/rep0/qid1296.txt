To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the content it tests. The question asks to identify a cube number from the given options: \(8\), \(15\), \(100\), and \(3\).

A cube number is the cube of an integer, i.e., an integer raised to the power of 3. Let's examine each option:
- \(8 = 2^3\), so it is a cube number.
- \(15\) is not a perfect cube.
- \(100\) is not a perfect cube.
- \(3\) is not a perfect cube.

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Answer
The correct answer is \(8\), as it is the only cube number among the options provided.

## 2: Analyze the Difficulty and Misconceptions
This question tests the understanding of cube numbers. A common misconception might involve confusing cube numbers with square numbers or not recognizing \(8\) as \(2^3\). However, given the straightforward nature of the question and the fact that the numbers are small and manageable, most students should be able to identify \(8\) as a cube number if they have a basic understanding of what cube numbers are.

## 3: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic mathematical concepts, including the definition of cube numbers. They might not recognize \(8\) as \(2^3\) and could choose any of the numbers randomly or based on incorrect calculations. Let's assume \(20\%\) might choose \(A\) (as it's a small, manageable number), \(20\%\) choose \(B\), \(30\%\) choose \(C\) (as it's a larger, seemingly more significant number), and \(30\%\) choose \(D\).
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of mathematics. They are likely to recognize \(8\) as a cube number (\(2^3\)). Let's predict \(60\%\) choose \(A\), \(15\%\) choose \(B\), \(15\%\) choose \(C\), and \(10\%\) choose \(D\).
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of mathematical concepts, including cube numbers. They should easily identify \(8\) as a cube number. Let's predict \(90\%\) choose \(A\), \(5\%\) choose \(B\), \(3\%\) choose \(C\), and \(2\%\) choose \(D\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have an in-depth understanding and can apply mathematical concepts with ease. They will certainly recognize \(8\) as \(2^3\). Let's predict \(98\%\) choose \(A\), \(1\%\) choose \(B\), \(1\%\) choose \(C\), and \(0\%\) choose \(D\).

## 4: Format the Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- **basic**: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced**: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
