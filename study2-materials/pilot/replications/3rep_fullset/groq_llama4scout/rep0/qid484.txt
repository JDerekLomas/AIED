To approach this question, let's analyze the shape presented and the potential misconceptions or understanding students at different levels might have.

The shape given is \( \Delta \), which represents a triangle. A basic property of a triangle is that it has 3 edges.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric vocabulary or counting. They might not recognize the shape as a triangle or might count incorrectly.
  - A=10% (unlikely to think it has 0 edges, but possible if they don't recognize the shape)
  - B=5% (unlikely to think it has 1 edge)
  - C=20% (might think it has 2 edges due to a severe counting error)
  - D=65% (most would still manage to count 3 edges correctly, even at this level)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple counting errors or not recognize the shape immediately.
  - A=5%
  - B=5%
  - C=10% (less likely to make a counting error leading to 2 edges)
  - D=80% (most understand it's a triangle with 3 edges)

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of basic geometry and can accurately identify and count features of common shapes.
  - A=0% (not likely to think 0 edges)
  - B=0% (not likely to think 1 edge)
  - C=2% (very few would mistakenly count 2 edges)
  - D=98% (almost all correctly identify 3 edges)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have an in-depth understanding and can apply it to complex problems. For a simple question like this, errors would be minimal.
  - A=0%
  - B=0%
  - C=0% (no chance of counting 2 edges)
  - D=100% (all would know it's a triangle with 3 edges)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=10% B=5% C=20% D=65%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=2% D=98%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
