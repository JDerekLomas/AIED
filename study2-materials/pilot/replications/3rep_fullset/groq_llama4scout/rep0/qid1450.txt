To approach this question, let's consider the properties of an equilateral triangle and the concept of rotational symmetry. Rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a figure can be rotated by a certain angle and still look the same. For an equilateral triangle, it looks the same after rotation by 120 degrees (or any multiple of 120 degrees) around its center.

## 1. Understanding Rotational Symmetry
- An equilateral triangle has 3-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after a rotation of 120 degrees (360/3 = 120 degrees).
- This means it has rotational symmetry of order 3.

## 2. Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 0 \) implies no rotational symmetry, which is incorrect for an equilateral triangle.
- Option B: \( 1 \) implies only rotational symmetry by 360 degrees (or 0 degrees), which applies to all shapes but doesn't capture the specific symmetry of an equilateral triangle.
- Option C: \( 2 \) suggests a 2-fold rotational symmetry, which would be correct for a square but not for an equilateral triangle.
- Option D: \( 3 \) correctly identifies the 3-fold rotational symmetry of an equilateral triangle.

## 3. Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand or recall the properties of specific polygons. They might confuse the concept of rotational symmetry with reflection symmetry or not understand that an equilateral triangle has more than just a 360-degree rotation that looks the same. 
  - A: 10% (some might think it has no symmetry)
  - B: 40% (might think only one position looks the same, which is technically true but not specific enough)
  - C: 20% (confusing with another shape)
  - D: 30% (some might know or guess the correct answer)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might not apply it accurately. They should know that a triangle can have rotational symmetry but might struggle with the specifics.
  - A: 5% 
  - B: 30% 
  - C: 25% 
  - D: 40%

- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of geometric concepts. They should recognize the symmetry of an equilateral triangle.
  - A: 2% 
  - B: 10% 
  - C: 10% 
  - D: 78%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand but can apply and perhaps even prove the rotational symmetry of shapes like the equilateral triangle.
  - A: 0% 
  - B: 2% 
  - C: 5% 
  - D: 93%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=30% C=25% D=40%
proficient: A=2% B=10% C=10% D=78%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=5% D=93%
