To approach this question, let's analyze the potential for students to make errors based on common misconceptions and the specific numbers provided.

The statement to make correct is: \( 76426 \)\[ {\color{blue}\square} \]\( 76462 \)\[ {\color{orange}\square} \]\( 74662 \).

Let's examine the relationship between the numbers:
- \(76426 < 76462\) because \(76426\) has a \(2\) in the tens place and \(76462\) has a \(6\) in the tens place, making \(76462\) greater.
- \(76462 > 74662\) because \(76462\) has a \(7\) in the ten-thousands place and \(74662\) has a \(7\) in the ten-thousands place but then \(76462\) has a \(6\) in the thousands place while \(74662\) has a \(4\), making \(76462\) greater.

So, the correct statement should reflect that \(76426\) is less than \(76462\), and \(76462\) is greater than \(74662\). This matches option D: ![A blue box containing a "less than" symbol  and an orange box containing a "greater than" symbol]().

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to compare numbers and insert the appropriate inequality signs to make the statement true.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
Common misconceptions might include confusing greater than and less than symbols or failing to compare numbers correctly, especially when the numbers are close or have similar digits.

## 3: Analyzing the Numbers
The numbers given are \(76426\), \(76462\), and \(74662\). The first and second numbers differ by \(36\), and the second and third numbers differ by \(1800\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic number comparisons. They might incorrectly place the symbols or confuse them. Given the closeness of the numbers and the potential for confusion, they might be more likely to choose an option that doesn't accurately reflect the comparison. Option B (less than, less than) could be tempting if they mistakenly think both comparisons are "less than." \(A=10\%\) \(B=40\%\) \(C=20\%\) \(D=30\%\)
- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a better grasp of number comparisons but might still make errors due to carelessness or misunderstanding. They are likely to understand that \(76426 < 76462\), but the comparison between \(76462\) and \(74662\) might be clear to them as well, leading to a higher percentage choosing the correct option. \(A=5\%\) \(B=20\%\) \(C=10\%\) \(D=65\%\)
- **Proficient**: Proficient students should easily compare these numbers and insert the correct symbols. The correct option D should be very appealing to them. \(A=2\%\) \(B=5\%\) \(C=5\%\) \(D=88\%\)
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to get this question correct without any issues, as it tests basic understanding of number comparison. \(A=1\%\) \(B=1\%\) \(C=2\%\) \(D=96\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=10% D=65%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=5% D=88%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=2% D=96%
