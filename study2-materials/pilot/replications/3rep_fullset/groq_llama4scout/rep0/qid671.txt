To approach this question, let's analyze the statements and the nature of the triangle described:

1. **Understanding the triangle**: The triangle has angles \( 90^{\degree}, 45^{\degree}, 45^{\degree} \). By definition, a right-angled triangle has one angle that is \( 90^{\degree} \), and an isosceles triangle has at least two sides of equal length, which also means two angles are equal.

2. **Analyzing Statement 1**: The triangle has a \( 90^{\degree} \) angle, which by definition makes it a right-angled triangle. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

3. **Analyzing Statement 2**: The triangle has two equal angles (\( 45^{\degree} \) each), which implies that the two sides opposite these angles are also equal in length. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.

Given that both statements are true based on the properties of the triangle described:

- A right-angled triangle has one \( 90^{\degree} \) angle.
- An isosceles triangle has two equal angles (and sides).

The question then becomes about the likelihood of students at different ability levels recognizing this:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric definitions. They might not clearly understand what makes a triangle right-angled or isosceles. However, the specific angles given might still lead a significant portion to recognize the right-angled nature. The concept of isosceles might be less familiar, but the equal angles could hint at it. **A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%**

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a better grasp of basic geometric terms. They should easily identify the triangle as right-angled. The concept of an isosceles triangle should also be familiar, and they should recognize the equality of the two angles. **A=20%, B=10%, C=60%, D=10%**

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid understanding of geometric properties. They will easily recognize both statements as true without any confusion. **A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%**

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the properties but can also apply them quickly and accurately. They will have no trouble identifying both statements as true. **A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%**

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
