To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with expanding expressions, especially when a negative sign is involved.

The question requires expanding the expression \(-(1-2p)\). The correct expansion involves distributing the negative sign, which changes the signs of each term inside the parentheses:

\[
-(1-2p) = -1 + 2p
\]

This corresponds to option A: \(-1+2p\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception when dealing with a negative sign outside parentheses is that students might forget to change the signs of the terms inside the parentheses. This could lead to an incorrect expansion such as \(-1 - 2p\) (option B), or students might incorrectly apply the rules of signs.

## 2: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A (\(-1+2p\)) is the correct answer.
- Option B (\(-1-2p\)) could be chosen by students who forget to change the sign of \(2p\) when distributing the negative sign.
- Option C (\(1+2p\)) would likely result from a student incorrectly adding or misunderstanding the effect of the negative sign outside the parentheses.
- Option D (\(1-2p\)) seems to ignore the effect of the negative sign outside the parentheses altogether.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with algebraic manipulations. They are likely to choose options that reflect a basic misunderstanding of how to handle the negative sign outside the parentheses. Option B (\(-1-2p\)) and Option D (\(1-2p\)) might be tempting because they reflect common errors such as ignoring the negative sign or mishandling it. 
  - below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of algebra but might still make simple mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the need to distribute the negative sign but might occasionally slip up.
  - basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid grasp of algebraic procedures and are less likely to make careless mistakes. They should consistently choose the correct option.
  - proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the procedures but can also apply them accurately and quickly. They are highly likely to choose the correct option.
  - advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
