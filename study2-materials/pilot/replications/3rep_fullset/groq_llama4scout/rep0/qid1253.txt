To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question presents a bar split into 5 equal parts, with 4 parts shaded pink, labeled as \( \frac{4}{5} \). One shaded part is labeled with a question mark. The task is to determine what fraction of the whole bar one shaded part represents.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question essentially tests the understanding of fractions as parts of a whole. Given that the entire bar is divided into 5 equal parts and 4 of them are shaded, representing \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the bar, we need to find out what fraction one part represents.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Answer
If 4 parts out of 5 represent \( \frac{4}{5} \), then 1 part out of 5 represents \( \frac{1}{5} \). This is basic fraction understanding.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve confusing the part with the whole or misunderstanding how fractions work. For example, some might think that if 4 parts are \( \frac{4}{5} \), then 1 part must be \( \frac{5}{4} \) of the total (which would actually be the case if you were solving for the total length based on one part, but that's not what's asked). Others might mistakenly think it's \( \frac{1}{4} \) because they see 1 part out of 4 shaded parts, not considering the total parts the bar is divided into.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic fraction concepts. They might choose \( \frac{5}{4} \) (A) because they see 5 parts and 4 are shaded, or \( \frac{1}{4} \) (C) due to misinterpreting the shaded parts as the total. \( B = \frac{1}{5} \) (likely correct but could be challenging for this group) and \( D = 1 \) (clearly incorrect as it represents the whole). Prediction: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic fractions. They should mostly understand that if 4 parts are \( \frac{4}{5} \), one part is \( \frac{1}{5} \). Prediction: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid understanding of fractions and should easily identify \( \frac{1}{5} \) as the correct answer. Prediction: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand fractions but can also apply them in various contexts. They will certainly choose \( \frac{1}{5} \). Prediction: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%

## 5: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the predicted percentages for each ability level are as follows:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
