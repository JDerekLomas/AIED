## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question requires students to expand the expression $6(p-2)$. This involves applying the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials), which is a fundamental concept in algebra.

## 2: Identify Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception when expanding expressions like $6(p-2)$ is not multiplying each term inside the parentheses by the factor outside the parentheses correctly. Specifically, students might forget to multiply the $6$ by the $-2$, or they might incorrectly apply the operation.

## 3: Analyze Option A
Option A, $6p - 2$, suggests that a student forgot to multiply the $6$ by the $-2$ inside the parentheses, which is a clear indication of not applying the distributive property fully.

## 4: Analyze Option B
Option B, $6p - 12$, is the correct expansion of $6(p-2)$, as $6 \times p = 6p$ and $6 \times -2 = -12$.

## 5: Analyze Option C
Option C, $p - 12$, suggests a misunderstanding of the distributive property and possibly incorrectly distributing or not multiplying by $6$ at all.

## 6: Analyze Option D
Option D, $6p - 4$, indicates a miscalculation in multiplying $6$ by $-2$, resulting in $-4$ instead of $-12$.

## 7: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with applying the distributive property. They might opt for A or C due to a lack of understanding or misapplication of rules.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make simple errors, such as choosing A or D due to calculation mistakes.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept and are likely to choose B, but a small percentage might still make careless errors leading to A or D.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of algebraic concepts and are less likely to make errors, thus mostly choosing B.

## 8: Predict Percentages
Given the nature of the question and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (not applying distributive property correctly), B=20% (correct but might be guesswork), C=20% (completely incorrect), D=20% (error in calculation).
- **Basic**: A=20% (common mistake), B=60% (correct application), C=10% (severe misunderstanding), D=10% (minor calculation error).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (careless mistake), B=90% (correct), C=2% (unlikely but possible), D=3% (minor error).
- **Advanced**: A=1% (unlikely mistake), B=98% (correct), C=0.5% (very unlikely), D=0.5% (extremely rare error).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
