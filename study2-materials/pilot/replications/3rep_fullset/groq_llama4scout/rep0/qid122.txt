## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question asks us to determine who performed the most consistently between girls and boys based on the mean and range of their test scores. Consistency in performance is related to the variability or spread of the scores, which can be indicated by the range (the difference between the highest and lowest score).

## 2: Defining consistency in the context of the question
In statistics, consistency or variability in performance can be measured by the range, variance, or standard deviation. The smaller the range (or variance, or standard deviation), the more consistent the performance. The range is directly provided in the question.

## 3: Analyzing the given data
- Girls: Mean = 75, Range = 20
- Boys: Mean = 60, Range = 40

## 4: Identifying the relevant statistical concept for consistency
The range indicates the spread of scores. A lower range suggests more consistent performance because it means the scores are not spread out as much.

## 5: Applying the concept to the given data
The girls have a range of 20, while the boys have a range of 40. Since 20 is less than 40, the girls performed more consistently.

## 6: Evaluating the answer choices
- A: The girls because their range is lower. This directly addresses the concept of consistency as defined by range.
- B: The boys because their mean is lower. The mean does not indicate consistency.
- C: The boys because their range is higher. This suggests the opposite of consistency.
- D: The girls because their mean is higher. The mean does not indicate consistency.

## 7: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of range and its implications for consistency. They might be confused by the terms "mean" and "range" and could choose based on mean (thinking higher mean means better, thus more consistent) or might not understand what "consistently" means. So, A=30% (some might get it), B=20%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic:** Students here understand basic concepts but might not apply them correctly in all contexts. They are likely to recognize that range indicates spread but might still be confused. A=50%, B=15%, C=15%, D=20%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts well and can apply them. They will likely choose A because they understand range indicates consistency. A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also reason abstractly. They will easily identify that the girls performed more consistently due to their lower range. A=90%, B=0%, C=0%, D=10%.

## 8: Converting predictions into the required format
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
