To approach this question, let's analyze the factorisation given and the common misconceptions students might have.

The expression given is \( p^{2}+16 p \). To factorise it, we look for two numbers that multiply to give \( 0 \) (since there's no constant term) and add to give \( 16 \). However, the correct way to factorise \( p^{2}+16p \) is to take \( p \) common, resulting in \( p(p+16) \).

## Step 1: Analyzing Jo's Statement
Jo says \( p^{2}+16 p \equiv(p+4)(p+4) \). This implies \( p^{2}+16 p \equiv p^{2}+8p+16 \), which is not true because \( 8p \neq 16p \) for all \( p \). So, Jo is incorrect.

## 2: Analyzing Paul's Statement
Paul says \( p^{2}+16 p \equiv p(p+4) \). When expanded, \( p(p+4) = p^{2}+4p \), which does not match \( p^{2}+16p \). So, Paul is also incorrect.

## 3: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand factorisation. They might not even attempt to verify Jo and Paul's statements properly. Given the simplicity of the question, but also the potential confusion, they might lean towards trusting the format of the equations without checking: A=30% (some might think Jo's form looks right), B=20% (Paul's seems plausible but not obviously correct), C=10% (unlikely to think both are correct without verification), D=40% (recognizing both are incorrect requires some understanding).

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic grasp of algebra but might still fall into common traps. They might check simple factorisations: A=25%, B=35%, C=5%, D=35%.

- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand factorisation well and can spot errors easily. They should see that Jo's and Paul's factorisations are incorrect: A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand factorisation but also can quickly identify and explain mistakes. They will easily identify both Jo and Paul as incorrect: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 4: Assigning Percentages
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
- **basic**: A=25% B=35% C=5% D=35%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
