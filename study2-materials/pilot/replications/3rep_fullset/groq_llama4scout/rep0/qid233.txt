To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or correct understanding related to algebraic conventions, specifically the order of operations.

The calculation given is \(2 \div (3 + a \times b)\). The correct algebraic convention, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), dictates that we first solve operations within parentheses, then proceed with multiplication and division from left to right.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Answer
The correct representation of \(2 \div (3 + a \times b)\) using algebraic convention is \(\frac{2}{3 + a \times b}\) or equivalently \(\frac{2}{a \times b + 3}\). This matches option D: \(\frac{2}{a \times b + 3}\).

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrectly applying the order of operations or not properly using parentheses to group operations. For example, some might mistakenly think the expression could be simplified as \( \frac{2}{3} + ab \) (option A), which violates the order of operations. Others might incorrectly distribute or apply operations not shown, leading to options B or C.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the order of operations and algebraic notation. They might opt for A because it seems to break down the problem into simpler components without fully understanding the implications of algebraic conventions. B and C might attract some due to confusion with how to handle the division and multiplication within parentheses. However, most would likely incorrectly choose A or C due to a lack of understanding. 
  - Below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to rushing or incomplete understanding of algebraic conventions. They are more likely to recognize the need for parentheses but might still choose C over D due to oversight of the multiplication symbol. 
  - Basic: A=20% B=5% C=40% D=35%

- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand algebraic conventions well and are likely to choose D. They might see through the obvious errors in A, B, and C, though some might still momentarily consider C before realizing the correct answer.
  - Proficient: A=5% B=2% C=10% D=83%

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand algebraic conventions but also can quickly evaluate the correctness of each option. They are highly likely to choose D and dismiss the other options due to a deep understanding of algebraic expressions.
  - Advanced: A=1% B=1% C=2% D=96%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=5% C=40% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=10% D=83%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=2% D=96%
