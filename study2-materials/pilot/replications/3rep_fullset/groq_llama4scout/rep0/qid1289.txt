To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \frac{6}{7} \times \frac{2}{3}=? \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to multiply two fractions: \( \frac{6}{7} \times \frac{2}{3} \). To solve this, students need to multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator and multiply the denominators together to get the new denominator: \( \frac{6 \times 2}{7 \times 3} = \frac{12}{21} \). This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3, resulting in \( \frac{4}{7} \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception when multiplying fractions is to add the numerators and denominators instead of multiplying them. However, in this case, that would lead to \( \frac{6+2}{7+3} = \frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5} \), which is not an option. Another potential error could be not simplifying the fraction \( \frac{12}{21} \) correctly or not recognizing that \( \frac{12}{21} \) simplifies to \( \frac{4}{7} \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( 1 \frac{11}{21} \) suggests an error in calculation or conversion, as it's much larger than the expected result.
- B: \( \frac{9}{7} \) could result from incorrect operations or a miscalculation.
- C: \( \frac{8}{21} \) might result from a calculation error, such as \( \frac{6 \times 2}{7 \times 3} = \frac{12}{21} \) but incorrectly simplifying or calculating.
- D: \( \frac{4}{7} \) is the correct answer.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the basic operation of multiplying fractions. They could mistakenly add or perform incorrect operations. Option D is the correct answer, but they might not get it. Let's assume A=20% (completely off), B=30% (incorrect but related to fractions), C=20% (near miss), D=30% (surprisingly gets it right).
- **Basic**: Students here understand the concept but might make calculation errors. They are likely to try the correct operation but might not simplify correctly. Let's assume A=10%, B=20%, C=30% (miscalculation), D=40%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept well and can perform the calculations accurately. They are less likely to make significant errors. Let's assume A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also apply it accurately and efficiently. Errors are minimal. Let's assume A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95%.

## 5: Final Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
