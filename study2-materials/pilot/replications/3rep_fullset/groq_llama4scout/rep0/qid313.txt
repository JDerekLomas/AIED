To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the content being tested and common misconceptions associated with it. The question involves the multiplication of a positive number by a negative number, which can be a source of difficulty for some students.

## Step 1: Understanding the Content
The question is \( 3 \times (-5) = \). This requires the application of the rule that multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number. The correct answer is \( -15 \), because \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) and the negative sign makes it \( -15 \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to ignore the negative sign or to mistakenly add or subtract. For example, some students might think \( 3 \times (-5) = -8 \) (because they mistakenly apply an operation that isn't multiplication), \( 3 \times (-5) = 8 \) (ignoring the negative altogether), or \( 3 \times (-5) = 15 \) (ignoring the effect of the negative sign).

## 3: Differentiating by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to have significant difficulties with basic arithmetic operations, including multiplication and handling negative numbers. They might choose any option randomly or based on a very superficial understanding.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic grasp of arithmetic but may struggle with applying rules for negative numbers consistently. They are more likely to make errors due to misunderstanding the effect of multiplying by a negative number.
- **Proficient**: These students generally understand the rules for multiplying positive and negative numbers. However, under stress or if they overthink, they might still make simple mistakes.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong understanding of mathematical concepts, including the rules for operations with negative numbers. They are less likely to make mistakes on this type of question.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given the question \( 3 \times (-5) = \):
- The correct answer is B: \( -15 \).
- A common incorrect response could be A: \( 15 \) (forgetting the negative sign), with some possibility of C: \( 8 \) or D: \( -8 \) if students are mistakenly applying addition or another incorrect operation.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (randomly guessing or not understanding negative numbers), B=20% (some grasp but not consistently applied), C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: A=30% (common misconception of ignoring the negative), B=60% (understanding but might make careless mistakes), C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=10% (minor mistake), B=85% (strong understanding), C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=2%, B=95% (strong and confident understanding), C=1%, D=2%.

The best answer is B. 

Below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
Basic: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
Proficient: A=10% B=85% C=2% D=3%
Advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
