To solve this, let's first calculate the answer to the expression \(12 \times 6 - 1 + 2\) and then determine where brackets need to be placed to make the answer equal 36.

## Step 1: Evaluate the original expression
The original expression is \(12 \times 6 - 1 + 2\). Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), we first do the multiplication, then the addition and subtraction from left to right.

\(12 \times 6 = 72\)

\(72 - 1 = 71\)

\(71 + 2 = 73\)

So, the original expression evaluates to 73.

## 2: Determine the target expression value
We need the expression to equal 36.

## 3: Examine option A
Option A: \(12 \times 6 - (1 + 2)\)

\(1 + 2 = 3\)

\(12 \times 6 = 72\)

\(72 - 3 = 69\)

This does not equal 36.

## 4: Examine option B
Option B: \(12 \times (6 - 1 + 2)\)

Inside the brackets: \(6 - 1 + 2 = 7\)

\(12 \times 7 = 84\)

This does not equal 36.

## 5: Examine option C
Option C: \(12 \times (6 - (1 + 2))\)

Inside the inner brackets: \(1 + 2 = 3\)

Inside the outer brackets: \(6 - 3 = 3\)

\(12 \times 3 = 36\)

This equals 36.

## 6: Examine option D
Option D: Does not need brackets

We've already calculated the original expression to be 73, which does not equal 36.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with order of operations and bracket placement. They might incorrectly choose option A or D because they don't fully understand how brackets change the operation order or they might not see the need for brackets to achieve a different result. Option C seems unlikely for this group because it requires understanding of nested operations. A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make careless errors. They might lean towards A or B due to misunderstanding the operations. Option C is more likely here than below basic because they have a basic grasp of operations. A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations and can apply brackets correctly. They are likely to choose C as it directly leads to the answer 36. A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very confident in their mathematical abilities and understanding of operations. They will likely quickly identify option C as the correct answer with minimal error. A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
