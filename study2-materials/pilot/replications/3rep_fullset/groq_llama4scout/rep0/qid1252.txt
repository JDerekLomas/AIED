To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the misconceptions it might trigger.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents two scenarios involving addition and subtraction, where Tom and Katie make statements about related calculations. Tom discusses adding 426 and then 428 to 4122, and Katie discusses subtracting 426 and then 428 from 4122.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom says if \( 4122 + 426 = 4548 \), then \( 4122 + 428 \) must equal \( 4550 \). To verify, let's calculate:
- \( 4122 + 426 = 4548 \)
- \( 4122 + 428 = 4122 + 426 + 2 = 4548 + 2 = 4550 \)
So, Tom is correct.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie says if \( 4122 - 426 = 3696 \), then \( 4122 - 428 \) must equal \( 3694 \). Let's calculate:
- \( 4122 - 426 = 3696 \)
- \( 4122 - 428 = 4122 - 426 - 2 = 3696 - 2 = 3694 \)
So, Katie is also correct.

## 4: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
The potential misconception here could be misunderstanding how addition and subtraction operations affect the result when the numbers being added or subtracted change. However, both Tom and Katie's statements are based on simple arithmetic principles that should be clear to students with a basic understanding of addition and subtraction.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations. They might not fully understand the implications of increasing or decreasing the numbers being added or subtracted. Given the straightforward nature of the calculations but potential for confusion, we might see:
  - A=20% (some might mistakenly agree with Tom)
  - B=20% (some might mistakenly agree with Katie)
  - C=40% (those who understand basic arithmetic and can apply it)
  - D=20% (those who see both are incorrect or are entirely confused)

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a solid grasp of basic arithmetic. They should easily see the correctness of both statements:
  - A=5% (unlikely to mistakenly choose only Tom)
  - B=5% (unlikely to mistakenly choose only Katie)
  - C=85% (most will understand both are correct)
  - D=5% (very few would think neither is correct)

- **Proficient:** Students here have a strong understanding of arithmetic and are less likely to make simple errors:
  - A=2% (very few would mistakenly choose only Tom)
  - B=2% (very few would mistakenly choose only Katie)
  - C=95% (most will correctly identify both as correct)
  - D=1% (very few would think neither is correct)

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the arithmetic but also can reason abstractly:
  - A=1% (a rare mistake)
  - B=1% (a rare mistake)
  - C=97% (nearly all will see both are correct)
  - D=1% (a rare error)

## 6: Providing the Answer
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
- basic: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- proficient: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
- advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
