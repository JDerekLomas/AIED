## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential misconception
The question presents a bar chart showing the number of cups of tea and coffee sold over 4 days and asks for the number of cups of coffee sold on Wednesday. The potential misconception here could involve misreading the chart or confusing the data for tea and coffee.

## 2: Analyze the chart for Wednesday
On Wednesday, the chart shows 25 cups of tea and 30 cups of coffee were sold. This is a straightforward piece of information.

## 3: Consider common misconceptions and errors
A common error could be misreading the chart, such as looking at the wrong day or the wrong drink. However, the question specifically asks for coffee on Wednesday, and the numbers are not complex.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students might struggle with reading the chart or understanding the question. They might confuse tea with coffee or misread the day. The correct answer is A: 30, but there's a chance they could pick a number that seems plausible but is incorrect, like confusing with another day or drink.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to read the chart but might make simple mistakes. They are likely to get it right but could confuse with similar numbers.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily read the chart and understand the question. They are likely to get the correct answer without issue.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only get the answer right but also be able to interpret the data accurately. They are highly likely to choose the correct answer.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
- **Below Basic**: 
  - A=60% (correct answer, but might be guessed)
  - B=15% (plausible incorrect number)
  - C=15% (another plausible incorrect number or mistake)
  - D=10% (mistaking Wednesday's coffee with another day's high coffee sales)

- **Basic**:
  - A=80% (correct, straightforward)
  - B=10% (simple miscalculation)
  - C=5% (confusing with tea or another small number)
  - D=5% (confusing with another day)

- **Proficient**:
  - A=95% (correct, no issue expected)
  - B=3% (minor calculation error)
  - C=1% (unlikely mistake)
  - D=1% (highly unlikely, confusing with a much higher number)

- **Advanced**:
  - A=99% (correct, no issues)
  - B=0.5% (very unlikely error)
  - C=0.25% (extremely unlikely)
  - D=0.25% (extremely unlikely)

## 6: Format the response as requested
Given the estimates:
- below_basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
- basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
- advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
