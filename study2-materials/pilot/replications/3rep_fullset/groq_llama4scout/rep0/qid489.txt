## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question tests the understanding of the relationship between the area of a square and its side length. The area \(A\) of a square is given by \(A = side^2\). The misconception here could be confusing the area with the side length or not being able to solve for the side length given the area.

## 2: Identify the correct answer.
Given the area of the square is \(64 \mathrm{~cm}^2\), to find the side length, we take the square root of the area: \(\sqrt{64} = 8 \mathrm{~cm}\). So, the correct answer is \(C: 8 \mathrm{~cm}\).

## 3: Analyze the potential for errors at different ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic mathematical operations or understanding of geometric concepts. They might confuse the formula for area or not know how to find the square root of 64, potentially leading them to choose \(A: 32 \mathrm{~cm}\) (thinking the side length is half the area or another incorrect operation), \(D: 64 \mathrm{~cm}\) (equating area directly to side length), or \(B: 16 \mathrm{~cm}\) (possibly a guess or incorrect calculation).

## 4: Predict error rates for each option at different ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** 
  - \(A = 40\%\) (incorrectly doubling or adding),
  - \(B = 20\%\) (incorrect calculation or guess),
  - \(C = 20\%\) (some might get it through trial and error or partial understanding),
  - \(D = 20\%\) (directly equating area and side length).

- **Basic:** 
  - \(A = 15\%\),
  - \(B = 10\%\),
  - \(C = 70\%\),
  - \(D = 5\%\).

- **Proficient:** 
  - \(A = 5\%\),
  - \(B = 5\%\),
  - \(C = 85\%\),
  - \(D = 5\%\).

- **Advanced:** 
  - \(A = 0\%\),
  - \(B = 0\%\),
  - \(C = 95\%\),
  - \(D = 5\%\).

## 5: Provide the predictions in the requested format.
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
