## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests
The question presents a quadratic equation in its factorized form: \((h+4)(h-3)=0\). To solve for \(h\), students should apply the zero-product property, which states that if \(ab = 0\), then \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\). Applying this to the given equation yields \(h + 4 = 0\) or \(h - 3 = 0\), leading to solutions \(h = -4\) or \(h = 3\). One potential misconception could be students not applying the zero-product property correctly or misinterpreting the equation.

## 2: Analyze the difficulty and potential misconceptions for each ability level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic algebra and the concept of solving equations. They might not understand how to apply the zero-product property or could easily confuse the operations needed to solve for \(h\).
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebraic concepts but might still make simple mistakes, such as incorrectly solving for \(h\) or not fully understanding the implications of the zero-product property.
- **Proficient:** These students are expected to have a solid understanding of algebra, including solving quadratic equations. They should easily recognize how to apply the zero-product property to find \(h\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebraic concepts and can apply them with ease. They are less likely to make mistakes on straightforward problems like this.

## 3: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
- **Below Basic:** 
  - A: \(4\) seems like a reasonable guess for some, but it's less likely to be chosen directly from the equation.
  - B: \(-4\) is a correct solution, but these students might struggle to derive it.
  - C: \(3\) is another correct solution and might be more directly inferred.
  - D: \(0\) might seem like a default or easy guess.
  Given the struggle with basic algebra, we might see:
  - A=20% (guessing)
  - B=15% (directly solving)
  - C=30% (recognizing one solution)
  - D=35% (misconception or guess)

- **Basic:**
  - These students should have a better grasp but might still make careless mistakes.
  - A=5%
  - B=40% (understanding of one solution)
  - C=50% (correct identification of the second solution)
  - D=5%

- **Proficient:**
  - A=0% (impossible correct solution not listed)
  - B=50%
  - C=50%
  - D=0%

- **Advanced:**
  - A=0%
  - B=50%
  - C=50%
  - D=0%

## 4: Adjust according to specific question demands and difficulty
The question seems relatively straightforward for students who understand the basic principle of solving quadratic equations through factorization. The potential for error seems low for proficient and advanced students but higher for those below basic and possibly basic levels due to misunderstanding or misapplication of concepts.

## 5: Provide the final prediction
Given the straightforward nature of applying the zero-product property:
- **below_basic:** A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
- **basic:** A=5% B=45% C=45% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=0% B=50% C=50% D=0%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=50% C=50% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=45% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=50% C=50% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=50% C=50% D=0%
