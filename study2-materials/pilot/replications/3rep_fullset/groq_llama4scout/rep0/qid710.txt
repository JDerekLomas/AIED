To approach this question, let's consider the properties of a rhombus and what happens when you join the midpoints of its sides. A rhombus is a type of polygon that has four equal sides. It is also known for its diagonals bisecting each other at right angles.

## Step 1: Understanding the Properties of a Rhombus
When the midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral are joined, the resulting figure is a parallelogram. 

## 2: Applying Midpoint Theorem
The midpoint theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half of its length. This principle can be extended to quadrilaterals by dividing them into two triangles and applying the theorem to each.

## 3: Specific Case of a Rhombus
In the case of a rhombus, because the sides are all of equal length and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, joining the midpoints of the sides creates a parallelogram with sides that are parallel to the diagonals of the rhombus and half their length.

## 4: Determining the Shape
Since the diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles, the parallelogram formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of a rhombus will have sides that form right angles (because they are parallel to the diagonals of the rhombus). A parallelogram with right angles is a rectangle.

## 5: Analyzing Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may not fully understand the properties of a rhombus or the effect of joining midpoints. They might guess or choose an option based on visual inspection rather than geometric principles. Given the visual nature of the question, some might incorrectly choose A (Square) if they think the resulting shape must be symmetrical and have right angles, or B (Rhombus) if they confuse it with the original shape. However, without a strong grasp of geometry, they might be split across options but likely to choose A or B due to a lack of understanding.

## 6: Considering Other Levels
- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding of shapes and might recall that joining midpoints creates a similar figure but could struggle with the specifics of the resulting shape being a rectangle due to the rhombus's properties.

- **Proficient:** These students understand the properties of quadrilaterals and the effect of joining midpoints. They are likely to correctly identify the resulting shape as a rectangle because they know the diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles, implying the sides of the new shape (being parallel to these diagonals) form right angles.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of geometric properties and transformations. They will quickly and accurately determine that joining the midpoints of a rhombus yields a rectangle.

## 7: Prediction
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20% (Some might go for square or rhombus due to symmetry, and fewer would know about rectangles or kites).
- **Basic:** A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30% (More aware of properties, but might still confuse with rhombus or square).
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=20% C=5% D=70% (Most understand it becomes a rectangle).
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95% (Almost all know it becomes a rectangle).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=20% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
