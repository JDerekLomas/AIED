To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might encounter.

The question is: \((-11) + 7 = \square\)

This question tests basic addition of integers, including the understanding of negative numbers. A common misconception or difficulty for students might be in handling the negative sign, especially when adding a positive number to a negative number.

## Step 1: Understanding the Operation
The operation involves adding 7 to -11. This can be visualized on a number line, where you start at -11 and move 7 units to the right. 

## 2: Performing the Calculation
To perform the calculation: \(-11 + 7 = -4\). This is because when you add a positive number to a negative number, you are essentially subtracting the absolute value of the positive number from the negative number. So, \(|-11| - 7 = 11 - 7 = 4\), but since you're starting from a negative, the result is \(-4\).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A common error might be to simply add the numbers without considering the signs, or to subtract them incorrectly: \(|-11| + 7 = 18\), which could lead to \(D = 18\) if students forget to consider the negative sign properly.
- Another error could be to subtract 7 from -11: \(-11 - 7 = -18\), leading to \(A = -18\).
- Students might also get confused and think the answer is just the negative of one of the addends or a simple combination without calculation.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle significantly with negative numbers and basic operations. They might:
- Add the numbers and ignore the negative sign: \(A = 10\%, B = 20\%, C = 10\%, D = 60\%\)
- Or simply not understand how to perform the operation: \(A = 40\%, B = 20\%, C = 10\%, D = 30\%\)

Given the potential for confusion, let's assign: 
- \(A = 30\%\)
- \(B = 20\%\)
- \(C = 15\%\)
- \(D = 35\%\)

### basic
Students at this level have a grasp of basic operations but might still make simple mistakes:
- They are more likely to understand the concept of adding a positive to a negative but might make calculation errors: \(A = 15\%, B = 70\%, C = 10\%, D = 5\%\)

Let's assign:
- \(A = 10\%\)
- \(B = 75\%\)
- \(C = 10\%\)
- \(D = 5\%\)

### proficient
Proficient students understand the operations well and are less likely to make errors:
- They should largely get it right: \(A = 5\%, B = 90\%, C = 3\%, D = 2\%\)

Let's assign:
- \(A = 2\%\)
- \(B = 92\%\)
- \(C = 4\%\)
- \(D = 2\%\)

### advanced
Advanced students are expected to have a deep understanding and make very few errors:
- Essentially, all should get it right or recognize any traps: \(A = 1\%, B = 95\%, C = 3\%, D = 1\%\)

Let's assign:
- \(A = 0.5\%\)
- \(B = 96\%\)
- \(C = 2.5\%\)
- \(D = 1\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=75% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=92% C=4% D=2%
advanced: A=0.5% B=96% C=2.5% D=1%
