To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the sequence provided.

The sequence shows a pattern where each term increases by a certain rule:
- The first pattern has 1 orange square.
- The second pattern has 3 orange squares, arranged in a 2x2 rectangle with one square missing.
- The third pattern has 5 orange squares, arranged in a 3x2 rectangle with one square missing.

The rule seems to be that the number of squares increases by 2 each time (1, 3, 5, ...), which are consecutive odd numbers. The arrangement is a rectangle that increases in base length by 1 for each subsequent pattern, with the height remaining constant at 2, and one square missing from the top left.

Following this pattern:
- The 4th pattern should have 7 squares (in a 4x2 rectangle with one square missing),
- The 5th pattern should have 9 squares (in a 5x2 rectangle with one square missing),
- The 6th pattern should have 11 squares (in a 6x2 rectangle with one square missing),
- The 7th pattern should have 13 squares (in a 7x2 rectangle with one square missing).

Given this, the correct answer for the 7th pattern is D: 13 orange squares arranged as an incomplete rectangle of base 7 and height 2, with the top left orange square missing.

Now, let's consider the likelihood of students choosing each option based on their ability level:

### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle to identify the pattern or to understand the sequence. They might focus on visual aspects rather than the mathematical pattern.
- A: Likely to be chosen by those who don't recognize the pattern (40%).
- B: Might seem plausible but less likely (20%).
- C: Could be considered if they add 2 then 4 (10%).
- D: Correct answer, but might be guessed or recognized by a few (30%).

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of sequences and can identify simple patterns. They might still be prone to errors if the pattern isn't immediately obvious.
- A: Less likely as they might recognize the sequence increases (10%).
- B: Could be considered a plausible next step (20%).
- C: Might seem right if they misjudge the sequence (20%).
- D: Should be recognized by most as the pattern (50%).

### proficient
Students at this level are more likely to understand the sequence and less likely to make careless mistakes. They should clearly see the pattern.
- A: Unlikely (5%).
- B: Unlikely (5%).
- C: Unlikely (5%).
- D: Highly likely (85%).

### advanced
Students at this level not only understand the pattern but can also generalize it. They are less likely to make mistakes.
- A: Very unlikely (0%).
- B: Very unlikely (0%).
- C: Very unlikely (0%).
- D: Almost certain (100%).

Given the analysis:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=20% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
