To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question asks for the correct factorization of \(2x^{2} - 50\). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The expression \(2x^{2} - 50\) can be simplified by first factoring out a 2, resulting in \(2(x^{2} - 25)\). Recognizing that \(x^{2} - 25\) is a difference of squares, it further factors into \((x - 5)(x + 5)\). Therefore, the fully factored form is \(2(x - 5)(x + 5)\).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- A: \(2(x^{2} - 25)\) is a partial factorization and is correct as far as it goes but does not fully factor the expression.
- B: \(2(x - 5)(x - 5)\) or \(2(x - 5)^{2}\) would be incorrect because it implies the expression equals \(2x^{2} - 50 = 2(x^{2} - 10x + 25)\), which is not true.
- C: \(2(x - 5)(x + 5)\) is the correct full factorization.
- D: \(2(x - 12.5)^{2}\) suggests a different and incorrect factorization that doesn't align with the original expression.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and factoring. They might choose A because it looks like a simple factorization but doesn't complete it, or they might not recognize the difference of squares. B could be chosen if they mistakenly think \((x-5)(x-5)\) or a similar incorrect form is correct. C requires understanding of difference of squares, which might be challenging. D seems unlikely as it involves completing the square or another form of manipulation that might confuse them. 
  - A=40% (simple step but not fully factored), B=30% (misconception about factoring), C=20% (correct but challenging), D=10%.

- **Basic**: Students here should have a grasp of simple factorizations and might recognize the difference of squares. However, they might still choose A because it's a straightforward factor but not complete, or B due to confusion. C should start to look correct to them. D is less likely as it involves more complex algebra.
  - A=30%, B=25%, C=40%, D=5%.

- **Proficient**: These students should easily recognize the correct factorization and be less likely to choose A (since it's not fully factored), B (because it's clearly incorrect), or D (which is not a standard factorization technique for this expression).
  - A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only know how to factor but also understand why certain factorizations are correct or incorrect. They are highly unlikely to choose B or D.
  - A=5%, B=0%, C=95%, D=0%.

## 4: Conclusion
Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
- **Basic**: A=30% B=25% C=40% D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%
