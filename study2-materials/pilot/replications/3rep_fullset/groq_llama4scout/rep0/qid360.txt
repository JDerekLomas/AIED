## Step 1: Understanding the concept of median
The median of a set of numbers is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

## 2: Arranging the given numbers in ascending order
The given numbers are: $2, 2, 4, 7, 10, -15$. Arranging them in ascending order gives: $-15, 2, 2, 4, 7, 10$.

## 3: Identifying the median
Since there are 6 numbers (an even amount), the median will be the average of the 3rd and 4th numbers. The 3rd and 4th numbers are $2$ and $4$.

## 4: Calculating the median
The median = $(2 + 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3$.

## 5: Analyzing the options
- Option A: $7$
- Option B: $4$
- Option C: $3$
- Option D: $5.5$

## 6: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level may struggle with ordering numbers, especially with negative numbers, and calculating averages. They might incorrectly identify the median or not know how to calculate it. Option C is the correct answer, but these students might choose any option based on incorrect calculations or misunderstandings. However, given the simplicity of the numbers involved and the clear calculation needed, a significant portion might still stumble upon the correct answer or be misled by obvious incorrect options.
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic concepts but might make simple errors. They should be able to order the numbers and identify the need to average two middle numbers. However, they might struggle with the inclusion of negative numbers or making calculation errors.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily order the numbers, identify the middle numbers, and calculate the median correctly as 3. They are less likely to make errors in calculation but might still be distracted by incorrect options if they misinterpret the concept.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should have a strong understanding of statistical concepts, including the median. They are highly likely to answer correctly.

## 7: Estimating percentages for each ability level
- **Below_basic**: Given the straightforward nature of the calculation once the numbers are ordered, but considering potential difficulties with negative numbers and calculating averages, let's estimate: A=10% (misinterpreting the highest value), B=15% (choosing one of the middle values without averaging), C=60% (correct, through either understanding or luck), D=15% (miscalculating the average).
- **Basic**: With a bit more confidence in their calculations: A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students should be very confident: A=2%, B=5%, C=90%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: Extremely confident in their calculations: A=1%, B=2%, C=95%, D=2%.

## 8: Converting estimates to the required format
below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
