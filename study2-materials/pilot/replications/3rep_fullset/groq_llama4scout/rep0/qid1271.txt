To approach this question, let's analyze the inequality and the statements made by Jo and Paul.

The inequality given is \(t + 3 > -0.3\).

## Step 1: Solve the Inequality
To solve for \(t\), we subtract 3 from both sides of the inequality:
\(t > -0.3 - 3\)
\(t > -3.3\)

## 2: Evaluate Jo's Statement
Jo says \(t\) could be \(-3.4\). Let's check if \(-3.4 > -3.3\). Since \(-3.4\) is less than \(-3.3\), Jo's statement is incorrect.

## 3: Evaluate Paul's Statement
Paul says \(t\) could be \(3.4\). Let's check if \(3.4 > -3.3\). Since \(3.4\) is indeed greater than \(-3.3\), Paul's statement is correct.

## 4: Determine the Correct Answer
Given that Jo is incorrect and Paul is correct, the correct answer is that only Paul is correct.

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with solving the inequality or understanding the concept of inequalities. They might not accurately assess Jo and Paul's statements. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, but given the simplicity of the statements, they might lean towards guessing or not fully understanding the inequality solution. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 40\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 30\%\)
- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a basic understanding of inequalities. They might make simple calculation errors or misinterpret the inequality. \(A = 15\%\), \(B = 60\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 15\%\)
- **Proficient**: Students here should easily solve the inequality and evaluate the statements. Expect a strong understanding, but some might still fall into common misconceptions. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 80\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 10\%\)
- **Advanced**: These students should have a deep understanding of inequalities and be able to quickly assess the validity of Jo and Paul's statements. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 90\%\), \(C = 0\%\), \(D = 10\%\)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
