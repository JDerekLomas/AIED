## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a pictogram representing Bob's music collection, with each symbol equivalent to 4 CDs. Bob has 2 rave CDs, and we need to determine how he would display this on the pictogram.

## 2: Analyzing the Pictogram
The pictogram shows that each symbol represents 4 CDs. To represent 2 CDs, Bob would need half a symbol since 2 CDs is half of 4 CDs.

## 3: Identifying the Correct Representation
Given that 1 symbol represents 4 CDs, half a symbol would represent 2 CDs. We need to find the option that corresponds to half a symbol.

## 4: Evaluating the Options
- Option A: \( (1) \) represents 1 symbol, which equals 4 CDs.
- Option B: \( 00 \) represents 2 symbols, which equals 8 CDs.
- Option C: \( 0 \) represents 1 symbol, which equals 4 CDs.
- Option D: \( \Delta \) (or a half symbol, if we consider the representation) could imply half a symbol, which equals 2 CDs.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of a pictogram and the scaling of symbols. They might not accurately calculate half a symbol or could misinterpret the representation. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, possibly with A or C being common due to a misunderstanding of the symbol's value.
- **Basic:** Basic level students should have a grasp of the concept but might make errors in calculation or interpreting the symbol's value. They might choose A or C thinking one symbol is the smallest unit, or they might not understand how to represent 2 CDs correctly.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the concept and can calculate that 2 CDs would require half a symbol. However, the representation of a half symbol might not be directly provided, which could lead some to incorrectly choose A or C if they misinterpret the available choices.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will easily understand that 2 CDs correspond to half a symbol. They are likely to choose the option that best represents half a symbol, assuming it's clearly indicated as such.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Given the information and typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (misinterpreting as 4 CDs), B=10% (misinterpreting as 8 CDs), C=30% (similar to A), D=20% (recognizing the need for a half symbol but possibly not matching it correctly).
- **Basic:** A=30%, B=5%, C=25%, D=40% (starting to understand the proportion but might still make errors).
- **Proficient:** A=10%, B=5%, C=10%, D=75% (understanding the concept, choosing the correct representation).
- **Advanced:** A=5%, B=0%, C=5%, D=90% (clearly understanding and accurately choosing).

## 7: Finalizing Predictions
Considering standard interpretations and potential misunderstandings:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
- **Basic:** A=30% B=5% C=25% D=40%
- **Proficient:** A=10% B=5% C=10% D=75%
- **Advanced:** A=5% B=0% C=5% D=90%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=5% C=25% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=10% D=75%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=5% D=90%
