To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question presents an equation \(x + y = 12\) and two modifications of it: \(3x + 3y = 36\) by Tom and \(x + 2y = 24\) by Katie. The task is to determine who has written a related linear equation.

## 2: Analyze Tom's Equation
Tom's equation is \(3x + 3y = 36\). This can be simplified by dividing every term by 3, which yields \(x + y = 12\). This means Tom's equation is a multiple of the original equation, making it a related linear equation.

## 3: Analyze Katie's Equation
Katie's equation is \(x + 2y = 24\). To check if it's related to the original equation, we can try to transform it into the original equation or see if it's a linear combination of it. However, Katie's equation does not directly simplify to \(x + y = 12\) without additional operations that would change its form (like substitution), indicating it's not a simple scalar multiple of the original equation but rather a different linear equation.

## 4: Determine Related Linear Equations
A related linear equation can be formed by multiplying the entire original equation by a constant (as Tom did) or by adding/subtracting a multiple of the equation to another equation, but in this context, it seems we're looking for equations that are directly derivable or equivalent to the original through simple multiplication.

## 5: Assess Difficulty and Misconceptions
The potential misconception here might involve understanding what constitutes a "related" linear equation. Students might incorrectly assume that only equations which are direct multiples (like Tom's) are related or might not recognize that Katie's equation, although not a direct multiple, still represents a linear relationship with the original equation but with a different constraint.

## 6: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly assume both are wrong or that only one is right without understanding why. Given the simplicity of Tom's manipulation, more might recognize Tom's as correct. \(A = 40\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 20\%\).

- **Basic**: At this level, students understand basic algebra but might not fully grasp the implications of linear transformations. They should recognize Tom's equation as related but might be confused by Katie's. \(A = 30\%\), \(B = 25\%\), \(C = 35\%\), \(D = 10\%\).

- **Proficient**: Proficient students should easily recognize Tom's equation as a related linear equation through multiplication. They might see Katie's as not directly related through simple multiplication but could understand it as a different form. \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 60\%\), \(D = 15\%\).

- **Advanced**: Advanced students would not only recognize Tom's manipulation but also understand that Katie's equation represents a different line (related in the sense that it's a linear equation but with a different solution set). They should have a strong grasp of linear relationships. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 80\%\), \(D = 10\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
