To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with directions and angles.

The question requires students to understand directions (East, South) and how to calculate the angle of turn anti-clockwise. Facing East and needing to face South involves turning 90 degrees anti-clockwise.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question is straightforward: if one is facing East and needs to turn anti-clockwise to face South, they must turn 90 degrees, as South is directly to the left of East on a compass.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve misunderstanding the direction of turn (clockwise vs. anti-clockwise) or not accurately knowing the positions of the cardinal directions relative to each other. However, the question specifies "anti-clockwise," which helps to reduce confusion related to the direction of turn.

## 3: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \(90^{\circ}\) is the correct answer because turning 90 degrees anti-clockwise from East results in facing South.
- Option B: \(180^{\circ}\) would result in facing West, not South.
- Option C: \(270^{\circ}\) would result in facing North, not South.
- Option D: \(360^{\circ}\) would result in still facing East, as it's a full turn.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding directions and calculating turns. They might choose \(180^{\circ}\) (B) because it's a significant turn that feels "right" for changing direction substantially, or they might not understand the concept of degrees and turns. \( A=20\%, B=40\%, C=20\%, D=20\% \)
- **Basic:** Basic level students should have a better grasp of directions but might still make errors due to miscalculation or misunderstanding the question. They are likely to choose A but might be tempted by B. \( A=60\%, B=25\%, C=10\%, D=5\% \)
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand both directions and angles well. They are likely to get it right. \( A=85\%, B=10\%, C=4\%, D=1\% \)
- **Advanced:** Advanced students have a strong understanding of spatial relationships and angles. They will almost certainly choose the correct answer. \( A=95\%, B=3\%, C=1\%, D=1\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
