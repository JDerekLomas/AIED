To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it might pose.

The question asks to simplify the fraction \( \frac{16}{28} \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 16 and 28 is 4. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4 gives \( \frac{4}{7} \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
- A common misconception could be not simplifying the fraction at all, leading to option A: \( \frac{16}{28} \).
- Another error could be incorrectly finding the GCD or not dividing both the numerator and denominator by it, potentially leading to option C: \( \frac{4}{7} \) but mistakenly thinking \( \frac{4}{6} \) is correct if they incorrectly find a GCD or apply it wrongly.
- Option B: \( \frac{1}{13} \) seems unlikely as it doesn't directly relate to a simple division or common factor of 16 and 28.

## 2: Analyzing Option Choices
- **Option A (\( \frac{16}{28} \))**: This is the original fraction, not simplified. Students who do not understand or forget to simplify fractions might choose this.
- **Option B (\( \frac{1}{13} \))**: This would require a misunderstanding of both the numbers and the simplification process, as \( \frac{16}{28} \) does not simplify to \( \frac{1}{13} \) by any standard method.
- **Option C (\( \frac{4}{6} \))**: This option suggests a student might have found a common factor (2) but not applied it correctly to both numbers to get \( \frac{4}{7} \), or made a calculation error.
- **Option D (\( \frac{4}{7} \))**: This is the correct simplification.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with finding GCDs or simplifying fractions. They are more likely to leave the fraction as is (A) or make significant errors (B or C). So, A=60%, B=20%, C=15%, D=5%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make mistakes. They are less likely to choose A but might still opt for C due to calculation errors. So, A=30%, B=10%, C=25%, D=35%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand fractions and can simplify them. They are likely to get it right but might still occasionally choose A. So, A=10%, B=5%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident and accurate in their mathematical operations. They are very unlikely to make mistakes. So, A=2%, B=1%, C=1%, D=96%.

## 4: Formatting the Response
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=25% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=1% D=96%
