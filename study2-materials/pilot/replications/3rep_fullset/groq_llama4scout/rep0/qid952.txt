To approach this question, let's consider what is being tested: the understanding of rotational symmetry. Rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a shape can be rotated by a certain angle and still look the same. The key here is to understand that rotational symmetry is about the shape looking the same after a rotation around a central point.

The shape described consists of two ellipses (oval shapes) whose centers are aligned but are oriented at right angles to each other. 

## Step 1: Understanding Rotational Symmetry
A shape has rotational symmetry of order \(n\) if it looks the same after a rotation of \(\frac{360^\circ}{n}\) around a central point. For example, a circle has rotational symmetry of order infinity because it looks the same after any rotation. A square has rotational symmetry of order 4 because it looks the same after rotations of \(90^\circ\), \(180^\circ\), \(270^\circ\), and \(360^\circ\).

## 2: Analyzing the Shape
The given shape consists of two ellipses that are perpendicular to each other and share the same center line (their centers are on the same line but the ellipses themselves are at right angles). For this shape to look the same after rotation, the rotation must align the ellipses with themselves.

## 3: Identifying Rotational Symmetry in the Shape
Given that one ellipse is at right angles to the other and they share a line through their centers, the shape will look the same after a \(180^\circ\) rotation because this rotation will flip both ellipses onto themselves. A \(90^\circ\) or \(270^\circ\) rotation will not make the shape look the same because the ellipses are not symmetric about their minor axis in a way that would align with the major axis of the other ellipse after such rotations.

## 4: Determining the Order of Rotational Symmetry
The shape looks the same after a \(180^\circ\) rotation. This implies it has rotational symmetry of order 2, because \(360^\circ / 180^\circ = 2\). It does not have rotational symmetry of order 4 because a \(90^\circ\) rotation does not make the shape look the same.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding symmetry. They might think the shape has no rotational symmetry (A=40%), or it looks the same only after a full rotation (B=30%), with some guessing it has symmetry of order 2 (C=20%), and a few might overestimate (D=10%).
- **Basic**: Students here might recognize the shape has some level of symmetry. They could incorrectly think it has no symmetry (A=20%), or it looks the same only after a complete rotation (B=20%), a significant portion might correctly identify it as order 2 symmetry (C=40%), and a few might guess higher symmetry (D=20%).
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand rotational symmetry well. They might incorrectly choose A (5%), B (5%), but most would correctly choose C (80%), with a few guessing D (10%).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a deep understanding. They are unlikely to choose A (0%), B (0%), and very likely to choose C (90%), with a few possibly overestimating to D (10%).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
