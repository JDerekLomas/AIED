To predict how students at different ability levels might respond to this question, let's consider the concepts involved and the common misconceptions.

The question asks for the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 4. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

- The multiples of 8 are: 8, 16, 24, 32, ...
- The multiples of 4 are: 4, 8, 12, 16, ...

The first number that appears in both lists is 8, which means 8 is the lowest common multiple of 8 and 4.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception might involve confusing the LCM with the greatest common divisor (GCD) or simply not understanding what LCM means. However, in this case, the numbers are straightforward.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: 32 is a common multiple but not the lowest.
- Option B: 4 is a factor of both but not the LCM.
- Option C: 8 is correct as it's the smallest number that both 8 and 4 divide into evenly.
- Option D: 16 is also a common multiple but not the lowest.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic concepts of factors and multiples. They might incorrectly choose B (4) because they think the smallest number must be a factor of both, not realizing it's about the smallest common multiple. A few might pick A (32) due to a lack of understanding. The correct answer, C (8), might be chosen by those who have a very basic grasp of the concept. So, below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=40% D=20%.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a better grasp of factors and multiples but might still make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose C (8) as they understand the basic concept of LCM. Some might confuse it with GCD, choosing B (4). So, basic: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%.
- **Proficient:** Students here have a solid understanding of LCM and should easily identify C (8) as the correct answer. Mistakes might come from overthinking or miscalculation, leading to A (32) or D (16). So, proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%.
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand LCM but also can apply it quickly. The correct answer, C (8), should be a near-certainty. So, advanced: A=0% B=0% C=98% D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=98% D=2%
