To approach this question, let's analyze the shape described—a rectangle—and the concept of lines of symmetry. A line of symmetry is a line that divides a shape into two congruent parts, where one part is a mirror image of the other.

A rectangle has two lines of symmetry: one that runs through the midpoints of the longer sides and one that runs through the midpoints of the shorter sides. 

Given this, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric concepts. They might not fully understand what a line of symmetry is or how to identify one in a shape. 
  - A=20% (some might think it has no lines of symmetry due to a lack of understanding)
  - B=40% (might think it has one line of symmetry, a common misconception)
  - C=30% (could correctly identify two lines of symmetry, but this is less likely)
  - D=10% (unlikely to think it has four lines of symmetry)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors on slightly more complex questions.
  - A=5% (less likely to think it has no lines of symmetry)
  - B=20% (some might still think one line of symmetry)
  - C=60% (most would correctly identify two lines of symmetry)
  - D=15% (some might incorrectly think it has four lines of symmetry)

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid understanding of geometric concepts and are less likely to make errors on straightforward questions like this.
  - A=0% (unlikely to think it has no lines of symmetry)
  - B=5% (very few would think one line of symmetry)
  - C=90% (most would correctly identify two lines of symmetry)
  - D=5% (a few might incorrectly think it has four lines of symmetry)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts well but can also apply them to more complex scenarios. Errors on a simple question like this are unlikely.
  - A=0% (no one would think it has no lines of symmetry)
  - B=0% (no one would think one line of symmetry)
  - C=95% (virtually all would correctly identify two lines of symmetry)
  - D=5% (a very few might mistakenly consider four lines of symmetry, possibly due to confusing it with a square)

Based on these considerations, here are the predictions:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
