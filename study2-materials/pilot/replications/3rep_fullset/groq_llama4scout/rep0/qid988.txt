## Step 1: Understand the question
The question requires students to share £360 in the ratio 2:7. This means the total parts are 2 + 7 = 9 parts. Each part's value is £360 / 9 = £40.

## 2: Calculate the shares
- The 2 parts share is 2 * £40 = £80.
- The 7 parts share is 7 * £40 = £280.

## 3: Compare with given options
- Option A: £60: £300. This does not match £80: £280.
- Option B: £180: £51 (or £180: £180 is not considered as it's not an option, but £180 + £180 = £360, however, the ratio 2:7 does not support this).
- Option C: £100: £260. This does not match £80: £280.
- Option D: £80: £280. This matches our calculation.

## 4: Identify potential misconceptions and errors
Students might make errors if they misunderstand ratios or incorrectly calculate the value of each part. For example, they might not add the parts of the ratio correctly (2+7=9) or incorrectly distribute the £360.

## 5: Consider student ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of ratios. They are likely to make significant errors.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes or misunderstand how to apply ratios.
- **Proficient**: These students understand ratios and can perform calculations accurately but might get distracted or make careless mistakes.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of ratios and proportional reasoning.

## 6: Predict student responses
- **Below_basic**: A=20% (some might accidentally stumble on correct numbers), B=30% (incorrect but plausible simple errors), C=20% (error in calculation or ratio), D=30% (correct calculation).
- **Basic**: A=10% (less likely to make simple errors), B=20% (still prone to mistakes), C=10% (specific miscalculation), D=60% (correct).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (rare mistake), B=5% (uncommon error), C=5% (unlikely), D=85% (mostly correct).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (very unlikely), B=0% (unlikely), C=0% (unlikely), D=100% (almost certainly correct).

## 7: Adjust predictions based on common mistakes
Given the nature of the question, common mistakes include miscalculating the total parts (2+7=9) and then misapplying these to find shares. Most students, even at lower levels, should be able to identify the correct ratio shares with minimal calculation errors.

## 8: Final predictions
- **below_basic**: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=5% B=20% C=10% D=65%
- **proficient**: A=2% B=5% C=3% D=90%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=10% D=65%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=3% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
