To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it presents.

The question requires students to use estimation to compare the products of two multiplication problems to 320, without calculating the exact answers. 

1. **Tom says \( 82 \times 4 < 320 \)**: To assess if Tom is correct, we can estimate. Since \( 80 \times 4 = 320 \), and \( 82 \) is only slightly more than \( 80 \), \( 82 \times 4 \) will be slightly more than \( 320 \), making Tom incorrect.

2. **Katie says \( 41 \times 8 > 320 \)**: For Katie, since \( 40 \times 8 = 320 \), and \( 41 \) is slightly more than \( 40 \), \( 41 \times 8 \) will be slightly more than \( 320 \), making Katie correct.

Given these assessments:
- Tom is incorrect because \( 82 \times 4 \) is slightly more than 320.
- Katie is correct because \( 41 \times 8 \) is indeed more than 320.

The correct answer is **B: Only Katie**.

## Analysis by Ability Level:

### below_basic:
At this level, students might struggle with basic multiplication facts and estimation. They might not accurately estimate or compare numbers.
- A: XX% (Some might mistakenly agree with Tom due to not understanding estimation)
- B: XX% (Could be a significant portion if they understand Katie's statement is correct but not Tom's)
- C: XX% (Unlikely, as this would require understanding both are correct or incorrect)
- D: XX% (Might choose this if they think neither is correct due to confusion)

### basic:
Students at this level have a better grasp of multiplication but might still struggle with nuanced estimation questions.
- A: 20% (Might think Tom is correct due to misunderstanding)
- B: 60% (Recognize Katie's correctness and Tom's incorrectness)
- C: 10% (Incorrect, as it requires both to be right or wrong opposite of actual)
- D: 10% (Think neither is correct)

### proficient:
These students have a solid understanding of multiplication and estimation.
- A: 5% (Unlikely to think only Tom is correct)
- B: 80% (Understand Katie is correct and Tom is not)
- C: 5% (Think both are correct or incorrect, unlikely)
- D: 10% (Might think neither is correct, but less likely)

### advanced:
Students at this level are adept at estimation and can apply it well.
- A: 0% (Very unlikely to think Tom is correct alone)
- B: 90% (Easily see Katie's correctness and Tom's mistake)
- C: 5% (Incorrect assessment)
- D: 5% (Very unlikely)

## Final Predictions:
Given the analysis, here are the predictions in the required format:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
