To solve the equation \(0.45 = 0.3p\), we first divide both sides by 0.3 to isolate \(p\). 

\[p = \frac{0.45}{0.3}\]

\[p = 1.5\]

So, the correct answer is B) \(p = 1.5\).

Now, let's analyze the potential misconceptions and difficulties for students at different levels:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic division, especially with decimals. They might not know how to divide 0.45 by 0.3 or could make calculation errors.

- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to perform simple division with decimals. However, they might be prone to making calculation mistakes or using incorrect operations.

- **Proficient:** Students at this level should be able to solve the equation correctly but might still make minor calculation errors under pressure.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to solve the equation correctly with ease and understand the concept well.

Given these considerations, here's a prediction of the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

### Below Basic
- A) \(p = \frac{2}{3}\): 20% (might try to simplify but not solve correctly)
- B) \(p = 1.5\): 30% (correct but calculation could be tricky)
- C) \(p = 0.135\): 20% (might incorrectly multiply or divide)
- D) \(p = 0.15\): 30% (simple division mistake)

### Basic
- A) \(p = \frac{2}{3}\): 10% (some might relate fractions to decimals)
- B) \(p = 1.5\): 60% (understanding of division and decimals)
- C) \(p = 0.135\): 10% (incorrect operation)
- D) \(p = 0.15\): 20% (calculation error)

### Proficient
- A) \(p = \frac{2}{3}\): 5% (fraction to decimal conversion error)
- B) \(p = 1.5\): 85% (confident in division and decimals)
- C) \(p = 0.135\): 5% (unlikely to make a basic operation mistake)
- D) \(p = 0.15\): 5% (minor calculation error)

### Advanced
- A) \(p = \frac{2}{3}\): 0% (unlikely to confuse with fraction conversion)
- B) \(p = 1.5\): 95% (straightforward calculation)
- C) \(p = 0.135\): 0% (aware of correct operation)
- D) \(p = 0.15\): 5% (negligible chance of error)

Therefore, the response in the required format:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
