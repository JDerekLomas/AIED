To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls or ease of recognition for powers of 4.

The question asks to identify a power of 4 from the given options: A) \(44\), B) \(64\), C) \(400\), and D) \(8\).

## Step 1: Understanding Powers of 4
A power of 4 means a number that can be expressed as \(4^n\), where \(n\) is a positive integer. For example, \(4^1 = 4\), \(4^2 = 16\), \(4^3 = 64\), and so on.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- A) \(44\): This is not a power of 4; it's simply 44.
- B) \(64\): This is \(4^3\), so it is a power of 4.
- C) \(400\): This is not a straightforward power of 4. Checking, \(4^4 = 256\) and \(4^5 = 1024\), so 400 is not a power of 4.
- D) \(8\): This can be expressed as \(4^{\frac{3}{2}}\) or \(2^3\), but not as a simple power of 4 with an integer exponent.

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions and Difficulty Levels
Students might mistakenly choose options that look like they could be powers of 4 or might not recognize \(4^3 = 64\) directly. Option D) \(8\) could be tempting because students might recall that \(2^3 = 8\) and \(4 = 2^2\), but converting directly to a power of 4 isn't straightforward without calculation.

## 4: Ability Level Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not recognize powers of 4 well and could choose any option based on limited knowledge. They might pick A) \(44\) or C) \(400\) due to a lack of understanding or pick D) \(8\) because it's a small, familiar number. B) \(64\) might be chosen by those who have memorized some powers of 4.
- **Basic**: Students here should have some familiarity with basic powers of numbers. They are likely to recognize \(64\) as \(4^3\), making B) \(64\) a strong choice. Some might still be tempted by D) \(8\) due to its relation to 2 and 4.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily identify \(64\) as a power of 4. They might be less likely to choose A) \(44\) or C) \(400\) due to a better understanding of exponential growth.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only easily identify \(64\) as \(4^3\) but also quickly dismiss the other options due to a strong understanding of exponents and powers.

## 5: Predicting Percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple, familiar number), B=20% (some might have memorized), C=30% (looks big, might fit), D=20% (simple, related to 2 and 4).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=60% (clearly \(4^3\)), C=10%, D=20%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=80%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
