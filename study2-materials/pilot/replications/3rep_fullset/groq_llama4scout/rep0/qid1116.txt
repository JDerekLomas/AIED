To approach this question, let's analyze the function machines and the operations they represent, focusing on the order of operations and the distributive property.

## Step 1: Understanding Function Machine A
Function Machine A shows two sequences:
1. \(p \rightarrow \times 2 \rightarrow -3 \rightarrow 2p - 3\)
2. \(p \rightarrow \times 2 \rightarrow -3 \rightarrow 2(p - 3)\)

The first sequence correctly represents the operation \(2p - 3\). The second sequence, however, incorrectly suggests the output is \(2(p - 3)\) which simplifies to \(2p - 6\), not matching the first sequence's output.

## 2: Understanding Function Machine B
Function Machine B shows:
1. \(p \rightarrow \times 2 \rightarrow -3 \rightarrow 2p - 3\)
2. \(p \rightarrow -3 \rightarrow \times 2 \rightarrow 2(p - 3)\)

The first sequence is correct, resulting in \(2p - 3\). The second sequence correctly results in \(2(p - 3) = 2p - 6\), but the operations are in a different order, and it does not match the output of the first sequence.

## 3: Understanding Function Machine C
Function Machine C shows:
1. \(p \rightarrow -3 \rightarrow \times 2 \rightarrow 2(p - 3) = 2p - 6\)
2. \(p \rightarrow \times 2 \rightarrow -3 \rightarrow 2p - 3\)

Here, the first sequence correctly represents \(2p - 6\), and the second sequence represents \(2p - 3\). These are two distinct and correct operations.

## 4: Understanding Function Machine D
Function Machine D shows:
1. \(p \rightarrow -3 \rightarrow \times 2 \rightarrow 2p - 6\)
2. \(p \rightarrow -3 \rightarrow \times 2 \rightarrow 2(p - 3) = 2p - 6\)

Both sequences in D result in \(2p - 6\), making them equivalent.

## 5: Identifying the Correct Pair
The task is to find which pair of function machines are correct. A correct pair would have matching or appropriately different outputs based on their operations.

## 6: Analyzing Option Correctness
- Option A is incorrect because the outputs do not match the operations correctly in a way that both could be considered "correct" in a comparative sense.
- Option B is incorrect because the sequences of operations are different, and so are the outputs.
- Option C represents two correct but different function machines.
- Option D shows two function machines that are supposed to be different but end up with the same incorrect formula if considering standard order of operations.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
Given the complexity and the need to evaluate the sequence of operations:
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with understanding the sequence and order of operations. They might incorrectly choose A or B due to not fully grasping the operations (A=40%, B=30%, C=20%, D=10%).
- **Basic**: Students at this level would likely recognize the difference in sequences and might start to understand the order of operations. They might lean towards C as a correct sequence (A=20%, B=25%, C=40%, D=15%).
- **Proficient**: Proficient students would clearly understand the order of operations and could accurately assess each machine. They would likely choose C (A=5%, B=10%, C=70%, D=15%).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students would not only understand but also quickly evaluate the correctness of each option. They would confidently choose C (A=0%, B=5%, C=90%, D=5%).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
