## Step 1: Understand the question
The question provides a recursive formula \(x_{n+1} = 10 - \frac{1}{x_n}\) and asks for the solution to \(x = 10 - \frac{1}{x}\) to 2 decimal places, given a starting value of \(x_1 = 4\).

## 2: Identify the equation to solve
The equation to solve is \(x = 10 - \frac{1}{x}\). This can be rearranged into \(x^2 - 10x + 1 = 0\).

## 3: Solve the quadratic equation
Using the quadratic formula, \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -10\), and \(c = 1\), we get:
\[x = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{(-10)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1}\]
\[x = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 - 4}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{96}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{10 \pm 4\sqrt{6}}{2}\]
\[x = 5 \pm 2\sqrt{6}\]

## 4: Calculate the roots
\[x = 5 + 2\sqrt{6}\] or \[x = 5 - 2\sqrt{6}\]
Given \(\sqrt{6} \approx 2.45\), then:
\[x \approx 5 + 2 \cdot 2.45 = 5 + 4.9 = 9.9\]
\[x \approx 5 - 2 \cdot 2.45 = 5 - 4.9 = 0.1\]

## 5: Consider the iterative process
The iterative formula given is \(x_{n+1} = 10 - \frac{1}{x_n}\). Starting with \(x_1 = 4\):
- \(x_2 = 10 - \frac{1}{4} = 10 - 0.25 = 9.75\)
- To see if it converges to one of the solutions, let's calculate \(x_3\):
\[x_3 = 10 - \frac{1}{9.75} \approx 10 - 0.1026 = 9.8974\]

## 6: Analyze convergence
The calculation shows that the sequence starts with \(x_1 = 4\), then \(x_2 = 9.75\), and \(x_3 \approx 9.8974\), indicating convergence towards \(9.9\) (as \(9.8974\) is close to \(9.9\)).

## 7: Evaluate answer choices
- A: \(9.8989 \ldots\) seems to be a precise calculation of one of the roots.
- B: \(9.75\) is the value of \(x_2\), not the solution to the equation.
- C: \(9.90\) is a rounded version of \(9.8989 \ldots\)
- D: \(9.9\) is a rounded version of the solution.

## 8: Predict student responses
- **Below_basic**: Might not understand the iteration or solving the quadratic equation. Could guess or not attempt. A=10% (precise calculation), B=20% (stops at \(x_2\)), C=30% (rounds correctly), D=40% (simple rounding).
- **Basic**: Understands basic algebra, might struggle with iteration or quadratic formula application. A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Proficient**: Can solve the quadratic equation and understand iteration. A=40% (appreciates precision), B=10%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Advanced**: Quickly solves the quadratic equation, understands convergence. A=60% (sees it as \(9.8989\)), B=5%, C=20%, D=15%.

## 9: Assign percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **below_basic**: A=10% B=25% C=30% D=35%
- **basic**: A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%
- **proficient**: A=50% B=10% C=25% D=15%
- **advanced**: A=70% B=5% C=15% D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=50% B=10% C=25% D
