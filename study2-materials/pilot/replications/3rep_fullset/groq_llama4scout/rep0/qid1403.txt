## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula for the area of a trapezium
The area \(A\) of a trapezium is given by the formula \(A = \frac{1}{2}(a + b)h\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \(h\) is the perpendicular height. In this question, \(A = 45 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\), \(a = 10 \mathrm{~cm}\), and \(b = 5 \mathrm{~cm}\).

## 2: Substitute the given values into the formula
Substituting the given values into the area formula gives \(45 = \frac{1}{2}(10 + 5)h\).

## 3: Solve for \(h\)
Simplifying inside the parentheses yields \(45 = \frac{1}{2}(15)h\), which further simplifies to \(45 = 7.5h\). Solving for \(h\) gives \(h = \frac{45}{7.5} = 6\).

## 4: Analyze the potential for student errors
The question requires students to apply the formula for the area of a trapezium and solve for \(h\). A common misconception might involve incorrectly applying the formula or making a calculation error. However, the numbers given are straightforward, and the calculation is simple.

## 5: Consider the difficulty level and potential student responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the formula or the algebra. They might not correctly substitute the values into the formula or solve for \(h\). Given the simplicity of the numbers, some might incorrectly use \(10 + 5 = 15\) and then think \(45 = 15h\), leading to \(h = 3\), which corresponds to option B. Others might not solve for \(h\) correctly.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to substitute into the formula and solve for \(h\) with some effort. They are less likely to make significant errors but might struggle with the division or incorrectly solving the equation, potentially leading to a variety of incorrect answers.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily solve for \(h\) using the correct formula and algebraic steps. They are likely to get the correct answer, \(h = 6 \mathrm{~cm}\), which corresponds to option D.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only solve the problem correctly but also do so efficiently. They will likely choose option D without hesitation.

## 6: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation and the correct answer being \(h = 6 \mathrm{~cm}\):
- **Below Basic:** A=10% (might use incorrect formula or make calculation mistake), B=20% (simple mistake, e.g., \(45 = 15h\)), C=10% (incorrect calculation), D=60% (surprisingly, some might get it right by chance or using a calculator).
- **Basic:** A=5%, B=10%, C=5%, D=80% (most get it right).
- **Proficient:** A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (all get it right).
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (all get it right).

The best answer is D. 

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
