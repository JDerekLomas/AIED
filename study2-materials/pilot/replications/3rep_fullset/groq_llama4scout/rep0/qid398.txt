To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question requires students to understand negative numbers and their position on a number line. John's flat is on floor \(4\), and the gym is on floor \(-1\). To find out how many floors John needs to go down to get to the gym, students need to calculate the difference between \(4\) and \(-1\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculation
The calculation involves subtracting the floor number of the gym from the floor number of John's flat: \(4 - (-1)\). According to the rules of subtracting negative numbers, this is equivalent to \(4 + 1 = 5\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrectly handling the negative sign or misunderstanding the direction of movement (up or down). However, the question explicitly asks how many floors John needs to go down, which should guide students toward the correct calculation.

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \(5\), which is the correct answer based on the calculation \(4 - (-1) = 5\).

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \(3\), which could result from a miscalculation or incorrect handling of negative numbers.

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \(6\), which does not directly result from a simple miscalculation of the given numbers.

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \(4\), which might result from simply taking the absolute value of John's floor or another form of misunderstanding.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with negative numbers and understanding the question. They might incorrectly calculate or simply choose an option without calculation. Option A (correct) might be chosen by 20%, B by 30%, C by 20%, and D by 30%, as they might randomly select or misunderstand the concept.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors. They might calculate but make simple mistakes. Option A might be chosen by 60%, B by 20%, C by 10%, and D by 10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand negative numbers and can calculate differences. They are likely to choose Option A (correct) 80% of the time, with minor errors leading to other options.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident and accurate. They would likely choose Option A 95% of the time, with very few errors.

## 8: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
