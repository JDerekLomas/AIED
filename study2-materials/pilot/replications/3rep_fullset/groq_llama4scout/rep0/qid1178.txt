To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question requires the student to factorize the quadratic expression \(p^{2}+5p+4\). The correct factorization, if it exists, should be in the form of \((p+a)(p+b)\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are numbers that multiply to give \(4\) and add up to give \(5\).

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Factorization
The numbers that multiply to \(4\) and add up to \(5\) are \(1\) and \(4\), because \(1 \times 4 = 4\) and \(1 + 4 = 5\). So, the expression \(p^{2}+5p+4\) factorizes to \((p+1)(p+4)\).

## 2: Analyze the Options
- Option A: \((p+2)(p+3)\) - This would give \(p^{2}+5p+6\), not \(p^{2}+5p+4\).
- Option B: \((p+1)(p+5)\) - This would give \(p^{2}+6p+5\), not \(p^{2}+5p+4\).
- Option C: \((p+1)(p+4)\) - This matches our correct factorization.
- Option D: Does not factorise - This is incorrect because \(p^{2}+5p+4\) can be factorized.

## 3: Consider Student Errors
Students might make errors if they are not careful with the factors of \(4\) that add up to \(5\), or if they mistakenly try to factorize it in a way that doesn't work. Common mistakes include:
- Incorrectly identifying the factors that add up to \(5\) and multiply to \(4\).
- Not checking if the expression can be factorized into integers or simple fractions.

## 4: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not know how to factorize quadratic expressions or might guess randomly. They are likely to choose incorrect options or think it doesn't factorize.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the concept but struggle with the specific numbers. They might choose A or B due to miscalculation or incorrect factorization.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to factorize the expression correctly. They might still make minor errors but are more likely to choose C.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to factorize the expression easily and correctly.

## 5: Estimate Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (since it's a plausible but wrong factorization), B=20%, C=20% (some might get lucky), D=30% (not knowing how to factorize).
- **Basic**: A=25%, B=20%, C=50% (most should get it right with some effort), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=90% (most get it right), D=0%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=100% (all get it right), D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
