To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and evaluate their validity based on properties of exponents and the patterns of numbers ending in 0.

## Step 1: Evaluating Tom's Statement
Tom claims there is no value of \( m \) for which \( 2^{m} \) ends in 0. A number ends in 0 if it is divisible by 10, meaning it must be divisible by both 2 and 5. Since \( 2^{m} \) is always even (divisible by 2) for any positive integer \( m \), the question is whether \( 2^{m} \) can ever be divisible by 5. It's known that powers of 2 never end in 5 or 0 because 2 raised to any power will always result in an even number not divisible by 5. Hence, Tom is correct.

## 2: Evaluating Katie's Statement
Katie claims there is no value of \( n \) for which \( 5^{n} \) ends in 0. For \( 5^{n} \) to end in 0, it needs to be divisible by 10, which means it needs to be divisible by both 2 and 5. Since \( 5^{n} \) is always divisible by 5 for any positive integer \( n \), we need to check if it can be divisible by 2. However, \( 5^{n} \) for any positive integer \( n \) will always end in 5, not in 0, because multiplying 5 by itself any number of times results in a number ending in 5. But consider \( 5^{1} = 5 \), \( 5^{2} = 25 \), and so on; none end in 0. The statement seems correct at first glance because \( 5^{n} \) ends in 5, not 0. However, we must consider if there's any \( n \) for which \( 5^{n} \) could end in 0 due to a different line of reasoning or exception.

## 3: Detailed Analysis of \( 5^{n} \) and \( 2^{m} \)
Actually, for any positive integer \( n \), \( 5^{n} \) will end in 5, and for any positive integer \( m \), \( 2^{m} \) will not end in 0 or 5 but in 2, 4, 8, or 6. The key insight is recognizing that no power of 5 ends in 0 because it always ends in 5, and no power of 2 ends in 0 because it doesn't end in 5 or 0. However, there's an important exception to consider for a product: if you multiply \( 2^{m} \) by \( 5^{n} \), you get \( 10^{min(m,n)} \) if \( m = n \), which does end in 0, but that's not what Tom and Katie are discussing.

## 4: Assessing Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic properties of exponents and may not fully understand the patterns of \( 2^{m} \) and \( 5^{n} \). They might incorrectly assume both Tom and Katie could be wrong or right based on misconceptions. A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still be prone to errors. They might recognize Tom's statement as correct but struggle with Katie's, or vice versa. A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%
- **Proficient:** These students understand the properties of exponents and the patterns of numbers ending in specific digits. They should recognize both Tom and Katie are correct based on the fact \( 2^{m} \) never ends in 0 (always ends in 2, 4, 6, 8) and \( 5^{n} \) never ends in 0 (always ends in 5). A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the properties but can also reason about them deeply. They will easily see that Tom is correct because \( 2^{m} \) can't end in 0, and Katie is correct because \( 5^{n} \) can't end in 0. A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
