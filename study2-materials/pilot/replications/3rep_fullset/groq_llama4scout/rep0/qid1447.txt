## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential misconception
The question requires solving a simple linear equation for \( a \): \( 2 = 3a - 4 \). The solution involves isolating \( a \) on one side of the equation. A common misconception could involve errors in handling the constants or the coefficient of \( a \), but the equation seems straightforward.

## 2: Solve the equation to identify the correct answer
To solve for \( a \), first add 4 to both sides: \( 2 + 4 = 3a - 4 + 4 \), which simplifies to \( 6 = 3a \). Then, divide both sides by 3: \( \frac{6}{3} = \frac{3a}{3} \), resulting in \( 2 = a \). So, \( a = 2 \).

## 3: Analyze the answer choices in relation to common errors
- A: \( a = 2 \) is the correct solution.
- B: \( a = -\frac{2}{3} \) would be incorrect and might result from a miscalculation.
- C: \( a = -6 \) could result from incorrectly solving the equation, possibly by subtracting 4 from both sides and then incorrectly handling the division or subtraction.
- D: \( a = -2 \) might result from another type of miscalculation.

## 4: Consider the difficulty level and potential errors for each ability group
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and could easily make mistakes. They might not even attempt to solve the equation or could mistakenly choose an option that seems "reasonable" without calculation, such as C or D due to confusion.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are likely to attempt solving the equation but could end up with incorrect solutions like B or C.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic techniques and are less likely to make mistakes on simple equations. They should mostly choose A.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to solve such equations with ease and accuracy. They should all choose A.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some get it by guess or simple trial), B=15% (miscalculation), C=20% (incorrect handling of numbers), D=25% (another type of error).
- **Basic**: A=70% (most get it right with some effort), B=10% (some miscalculation), C=10% (error in handling constants), D=10% (simple mistake).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (accurately solve the equation), B=5% (minor miscalculation), C=3% (error), D=2% (rare mistake).
- **Advanced**: A=98% (almost all solve it correctly), B=1% (rare miscalculation), C=0.5% (very rare error), D=0.5% (very rare mistake).

## 6: Convert predictions into the required format
Given the qualitative analysis, let's assign specific percentages:
- **Below Basic**: A=40%, B=15%, C=20%, D=25%
- **Basic**: A=70%, B=10%, C=10%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
