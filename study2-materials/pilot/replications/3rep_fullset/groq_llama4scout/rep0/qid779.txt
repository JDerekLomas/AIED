To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

## Step 1: Understanding the Statements
First, let's evaluate the statements made by Tom and Katie. Tom claims \(3\) is a common factor of \(18x\) and \(29y\). For \(3\) to be a common factor, both \(18x\) and \(29y\) must be divisible by \(3\). Since \(18x = 3 \times 6x\), it's clear that \(18x\) is divisible by \(3\). However, \(29y\) is only divisible by \(3\) if \(y\) is a multiple of \(3\). Therefore, Tom's statement is not universally true without knowing more about \(y\).

## 2: Evaluating Katie's Statement
Katie says \(x\) is a common factor of \(6x\) and \(9y\). For \(x\) to be a common factor, both \(6x\) and \(9y\) must be divisible by \(x\). \(6x\) is clearly divisible by \(x\), but \(9y\) is only divisible by \(x\) if \(y\) is a multiple of \(x\). Thus, Katie's statement is also not universally true without more information about \(y\) and \(x\).

## 3: Analyzing Tom's Statement for Misconceptions
A common misconception might be that if a number is a factor of an expression, it's automatically a factor of another expression without considering the variables' potential values. Tom's statement could be seen as correct if one assumes \(y\) is a multiple of \(3\), but it's not universally applicable.

## 4: Analyzing Katie's Statement for Misconceptions
Similarly, Katie's statement might be misunderstood if one overlooks that \(x\) needs to divide \(y\) for \(x\) to be a factor of \(9y\). Without specific conditions on \(x\) and \(y\), both statements seem conditional.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand what a common factor is or how variables affect factorability. They might incorrectly assume both statements are always true (C) or that one is true without conditions (A or B), with a significant portion possibly choosing D due to confusion. Let's predict: below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still fall into traps. They might realize that Tom's statement isn't universally true without \(y\) being a multiple of \(3\), and Katie's isn't true without \(x\) dividing \(y\). They might lean towards D, recognizing the conditional nature of both statements. Let's predict: basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand factors and variables well. They should see that Tom's statement requires \(y\) to be a multiple of \(3\) and Katie's requires \(y\) to be a multiple of \(x\). Most should correctly identify that neither statement is universally true. Let's predict: proficient: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the conditions but can also articulate them clearly. They should easily recognize that both statements are conditionally true and thus neither is universally correct. Let's predict: advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
