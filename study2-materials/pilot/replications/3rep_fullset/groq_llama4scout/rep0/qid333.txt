To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 0.26 - 0.6 = \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question requires students to subtract 0.6 from 0.26, which involves decimals. A common misconception when dealing with decimals is misunderstanding their place value or incorrectly performing operations, especially when subtracting a larger number from a smaller one.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
Students might mistakenly think that subtracting a larger decimal from a smaller one will yield a positive result or might struggle with borrowing across the decimal point.

## 2: Analyzing Option A (\( -0.34 \))
To get \( -0.34 \), one would perform \( 0.26 - 0.6 = -0.34 \), which is the correct calculation. This requires correctly handling the subtraction of decimals.

## 3: Analyzing Option B (\( 0.34 \))
This option suggests an incorrect positive result, which might come from mistakenly adding or not properly accounting for the negative result.

## 4: Analyzing Option C (\( -0.44 \))
This would be an incorrect result, potentially from miscalculating the subtraction.

## 5: Analyzing Option D (\( 0.2 \))
This option is also incorrect and might result from a miscalculation.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle significantly with decimal operations. They could mistakenly add (yielding \( 0.26 + 0.6 = 0.86 \), not an option) or incorrectly subtract, possibly getting \( -0.34 \) if they're familiar with the concept of negative numbers but not decimal operations well. However, due to the nature of the question, many might incorrectly choose \( 0.34 \) (B) because they do not understand negative results or might choose \( -0.44 \) (C) due to calculation errors. 
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of decimals but might still make errors in calculations, especially under time pressure or with less familiar numbers. They might incorrectly calculate or not understand the subtraction yields a negative, leading to a distribution where A (\( -0.34 \)) is less commonly chosen than one might expect, with B (\( 0.34 \)) and C (\( -0.44 \)) being plausible incorrect choices.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to perform decimal operations accurately. They should recognize that \( 0.26 - 0.6 = -0.34 \), thus choosing A (\( -0.34 \)) correctly. 
- **Advanced:** Advanced students would easily and correctly choose A (\( -0.34 \)), demonstrating a strong understanding of decimal operations.

## 7: Estimating Percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic:** A=20%, B=40%, C=30%, D=10%
- **Basic:** A=50%, B=30%, C=15%, D=5%
- **Proficient:** A=80%, B=15%, C=4%, D=1%
- **Advanced:** A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
