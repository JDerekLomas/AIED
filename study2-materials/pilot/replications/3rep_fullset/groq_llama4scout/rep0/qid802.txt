To approach this question, let's first solve the equation and then consider the types of errors students at different ability levels might make.

The equation given is:
\[
\frac{t+1}{3}=\frac{5}{4}
\]

To solve for \(t\), first cross multiply:
\[
4(t+1) = 5 \times 3
\]
\[
4t + 4 = 15
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
4t = 11
\]
Divide by 4:
\[
t = \frac{11}{4}
\]
\[
t = 2\frac{3}{4}
\]

So, the correct answer is \( t = 2\frac{3}{4} \), which corresponds to option A.

Now, let's consider the potential errors and how students at different ability levels might respond:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and fraction operations. They might incorrectly solve the equation or not solve it at all. Given the straightforward nature of the algebraic steps required, some might get confused and choose an option that doesn't involve solving the equation properly, such as C or B, due to miscalculation. However, the nature of the question does not strongly suggest a common misconception that would lead to B or C specifically without calculation errors.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and fractions. They are likely to attempt solving the equation but might make careless mistakes. The correct answer, \(2\frac{3}{4}\), is quite straightforward to obtain, so a significant portion might get it right. The potential for choosing B, C, or D would largely depend on calculation errors.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and are less likely to make straightforward calculation errors. However, they might still be susceptible to checking their work or ensuring their solution matches one of the provided options, reducing the likelihood of choosing incorrect options based on simple mistakes.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are not only proficient but also have a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. They are highly likely to solve the equation correctly and quickly.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some get it right through luck or simple trial and error), B=20%, C=20%, D=20% (common misconceptions or errors lead to these choices).
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=15%, C=10%, D=15% (more get it right, but some still make errors).
- **Proficient**: A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10% (most get it right, few make errors).
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=0%, C=0%, D=5% (almost all get it right).

In the exact format requested:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
