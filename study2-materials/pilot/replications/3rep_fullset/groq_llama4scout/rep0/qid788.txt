To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about finding the coordinates of the turning point of the graph \( y = (x - 1)^2 + 4 \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The given equation is in vertex form, \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex (or turning point) of the parabola. For the equation \( y = (x - 1)^2 + 4 \), it's clear that \( h = 1 \) and \( k = 4 \), so the turning point is \( (1, 4) \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires identifying the coordinates of the turning point of a given quadratic equation in vertex form. This form directly reveals the vertex, making the question straightforward for those familiar with the vertex form of a quadratic equation.

## 2: Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the vertex form with the standard form or not fully understanding how the vertex form directly gives the coordinates of the turning point. However, given that the equation provided is clearly in vertex form and the transformation from standard to vertex form is well-understood, the main error would likely come from misinterpreting the vertex form or simple algebraic mistakes.

## 3: Analyzing Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and the concept of vertex form. They might incorrectly identify \( h \) and \( k \) or confuse the signs. Expect a significant spread across incorrect options due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple mistakes, such as confusing \( (x - 1) \) with \( (x + 1) \) or misreading the equation.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the vertex form and can apply it correctly. They are less likely to make mistakes but might still fall into traps if the question was more complex or if they miscalculate.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the vertex form but also have a deeper understanding of quadratic equations and their graphs. They are highly likely to answer correctly.

## 4: Predicting Responses
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the clarity of the vertex form:
- **Below Basic:** A=60% (correct, due to simplicity and direct information), B=20%, C=10%, D=10% (errors due to misunderstanding or random guessing).
- **Basic:** A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5% (most get it right, but some simple errors).
- **Proficient:** A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1% (high accuracy with rare errors).
- **Advanced:** A=99%, B=0.5%, C=0.25%, D=0.25% (very high accuracy).

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
