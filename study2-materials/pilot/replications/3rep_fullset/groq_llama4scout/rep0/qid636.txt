To approach this question, let's first understand the rules of rounding to significant figures:

1. **Rounding to 1 significant figure**: When rounding a number to 1 significant figure, we look at the second digit. If it's less than 5, we round down, and if it's 5 or more, we round up. For \( \mathbf{6 0 5 . 7 6} \), the first digit is 6 (which will be our significant figure), and the second digit is 0. Since 0 is less than 5, \( \mathbf{6 0 5 . 7 6} \) rounded to 1 significant figure is \( \mathbf{6 0 0} \). So, Tom is correct.

2. **Rounding to 2 significant figures**: When rounding to 2 significant figures, we look at the third digit. If it's less than 5, we round down, and if it's 5 or more, we round up. For \( \mathbf{6 0 5 . 7 6} \), the first two digits are 60, and the third digit is 5. Since 5 is 5 or more, we round up the second significant figure (0) to a 1. Therefore, \( \mathbf{6 0 5 . 7 6} \) rounded to 2 significant figures is \( \mathbf{6 1 0} \), not \( \mathbf{6 0 0} \). So, Katie is incorrect.

Given this understanding:

- **Tom is correct** because \( \mathbf{6 0 5 . 7 6} \) rounded to 1 significant figure is indeed \( \mathbf{6 0 0} \).
- **Katie is incorrect** because \( \mathbf{6 0 5 . 7 6} \) rounded to 2 significant figures is \( \mathbf{6 1 0} \), not \( \mathbf{6 0 0} \).

So, the correct answer is **A: Only Tom**.

Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

### below_basic:
- Many students at this level might struggle with the concept of significant figures or might not carefully read the statements. They might incorrectly think both are wrong or both are right due to confusion.
- A: 20% (understanding Tom but not confidently eliminating Katie)
- B: 10% (mistaking Katie's correctness)
- C: 30% (incorrectly thinking both are right)
- D: 40% (thinking neither is correct due to misunderstanding)

### basic:
- Students at this level have a grasp of significant figures but might make careless mistakes or not fully understand the nuances.
- A: 50% (correct understanding of Tom, cautious about Katie)
- B: 15% (some still confuse Katie's statement)
- C: 20% (some still think both could be right)
- D: 15% (a few think neither is correct)

### proficient:
- These students have a solid understanding and are less likely to make errors.
- A: 70% (clear understanding of both statements)
- B: 10% (a few still mistaken about Katie)
- C: 10% (rarely, they might mistakenly think both are correct)
- D: 10% (very few would think neither is correct)

### advanced:
- Students at this level are very confident in their understanding.
- A: 90% (clear and confident understanding)
- B: 5% (very few mistakes about Katie)
- C: 3% (extremely rare to think both are correct)
- D: 2% (very rare to think neither is correct)

Given these considerations, here is the response in the requested format:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
