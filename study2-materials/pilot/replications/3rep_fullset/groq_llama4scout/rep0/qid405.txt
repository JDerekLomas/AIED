## Step 1: Understand the problem and the ratio given
The problem provides a ratio of blue paint to yellow paint to make green paint, which is \( 5:3 \). This means for every 5 parts of blue paint, 3 parts of yellow paint are needed.

## 2: Calculate the amount of yellow paint needed
Given that 1500 ml of blue paint is used, we first find out how many "parts" 1500 ml represents. Since blue paint represents 5 parts, 1 part is \( \frac{1500}{5} = 300 \) ml. Therefore, for yellow paint, which represents 3 parts, the amount needed is \( 3 \times 300 = 900 \) ml.

## 3: Evaluate the difficulty of the question
This question requires the application of a ratio to find a missing quantity. It's a straightforward application of ratio concepts, not prone to common misconceptions that might arise from more complex or differently framed questions.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with ratios or applying them to find specific quantities. They might not understand how to use the ratio to calculate the yellow paint or could mistakenly add or do something else with the numbers. Option C (900 ml) is the correct answer, but these students might choose any option randomly or based on a misconception. Let's assume A=20% (guessing total), B=10% (adding a small amount), C=50% (correct, but possibly by chance or simple calculation), D=20% (guessing a large total).

- **Basic:** Students at this level understand basic ratios and can apply them in straightforward situations. They are likely to calculate the yellow paint needed correctly using the ratio. So, C=70%, and the rest might be guessing or making simple errors, leading to A=15%, B=5%, D=10%.

- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with ratios and can apply them accurately. They will likely get the correct answer, C=90%, with minimal errors, possibly A=5%, B=2%, D=3%.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand ratios but can also work with them efficiently. They are expected to get the question correct, so C=95%, with very few errors, possibly A=2%, B=1%, D=2%.

## 5: Provide the predicted percentages in the required format
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=50% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=5% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%
