To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or ease of solving it.

The question asks for two numbers whose product is \(-24\). This involves understanding of negative number multiplication rules (i.e., two negatives multiplied together give a positive, and a negative and a positive give a negative).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The product of two numbers is \(-24\). To solve this, students need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-24\). 

## 2: Identifying Potential Solutions
Possible pairs that multiply to \(-24\) include: \((1, -24), (-1, 24), (2, -12), (-2, 12), (3, -8), (-3, 8), (4, -6),\) and \((-4, 6)\).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(-3\) and \(-8\) give a product of \(24\), not \(-24\).
- Option B: \(-4\) and \(6\) give a product of \(-24\), which is correct.
- Option C: \(-10\) and \(-14\) give a product of \(140\), not \(-24\).
- Option D: \(-3\) and \(9\) give a product of \(-27\), not \(-24\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts and the concept of negative numbers. They might not correctly calculate products or understand the rules for multiplying negatives and positives. Option B seems unlikely to be chosen by a significant percentage because it requires an understanding of multiplication and negative numbers. However, due to the lack of understanding, they might pick options that seem "reasonable" or make common errors (like A or D), but not necessarily C because it seems less straightforward. 
    - A: \(40\%\) (common mistake, not understanding negative multiplication)
    - B: \(10\%\) (correct, but might be hard for this level)
    - C: \(20\%\) (seems like a pair of numbers, but wrong product)
    - D: \(30\%\) (another potential pair, but wrong product)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of multiplication facts and some understanding of negative numbers. They might still struggle with applying these concepts correctly but are more likely to identify correct pairs.
    - A: \(20\%\)
    - B: \(40\%\) (should recognize \(-4 \times 6 = -24\))
    - C: \(15\%\)
    - D: \(25\%\)

- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with multiplication, division, and the rules for positive and negative numbers. They should easily identify the correct pair.
    - A: \(5\%\)
    - B: \(70\%\) (easily see \(-4 \times 6 = -24\))
    - C: \(5\%\)
    - D: \(20\%\)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong understanding of mathematical concepts and can apply them with ease. They are less likely to make simple calculation errors.
    - A: \(0\%\)
    - B: \(90\%\) (confident in \(-4 \times 6 = -24\))
    - C: \(0\%\)
    - D: \(10\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
