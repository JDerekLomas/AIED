To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions.

The question involves reflecting a rectangle across a vertical line within a grid and determining the effect on two points, P and Q, which are on the rectangle. Point P is at the bottom left corner of the rectangle, and point Q is at the bottom right corner of the rectangle, with the right-hand side of the rectangle on the vertical line of reflection.

## Understanding Reflections
When reflecting a point across a line, the line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection. 

## Analyzing Point P and Q
- Point P is 3 squares to the left of the line of reflection. When reflected across the vertical line, it will move to the right, so it will not stay in the same position.
- Point Q is on the line of reflection. When any point on the line of reflection is reflected across that line, it stays in the same position.

## Predicting Student Responses
Given this understanding:
- Tom says Point P stays in the same position, which is incorrect.
- Katie says Point Q stays in the same position, which is correct.

## Ability Levels and Predicted Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with understanding the concept of reflection or may not carefully analyze the positions of P and Q relative to the line of reflection. They might incorrectly think both points stay in the same position or both move, due to a lack of understanding of the reflection concept. 
  - A (Only Tom): 10%
  - B (Only Katie): 30%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 20%
  - D (Neither is correct): 40%

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of geometric concepts but may still make errors in application, especially if they misunderstand the reflection concept or misinterpret the diagram.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 60%
  - C: 15%
  - D: 20%

- **Proficient:** Students at this level should have a solid understanding of reflections and be able to apply it to the given scenario accurately. They should recognize that only Katie is correct.
  - A: 2%
  - B: 80%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 13%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also reason about it accurately. They should easily identify that Katie is correct and Tom is not.
  - A: 1%
  - B: 90%
  - C: 3%
  - D: 6%

The best answer is below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=60% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=2% B=80% C=5% D=13%
advanced: A=1% B=90% C=3% D=6%
