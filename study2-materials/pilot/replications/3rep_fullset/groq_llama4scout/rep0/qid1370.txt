To approach this question, let's consider what students at different levels of mathematical ability might find challenging or straightforward about identifying a linear function.

A linear function is characterized by a constant rate of change, which graphically represents as a straight line. With this definition in mind, let's evaluate each option:

A: This graph shows a curve that is not straight, indicating a non-linear function. It increases, then decreases, and increases again, which is not characteristic of a linear function.

B: This graph depicts a U-shaped curve, which is symmetrical and not a straight line. It suggests a quadratic or non-linear relationship rather than a linear one.

C: This graph shows a straight line from the bottom left to the top right, which is the defining characteristic of a linear function.

D: This option presents two curves that are not straight lines. They exhibit rapid changes and then become almost horizontal or vertical, indicating non-linear functions.

Given these descriptions, the task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who might choose each option.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand or recall the definition of a linear function and its graphical representation. They might be more likely to choose graphs that look complex or dynamic, mistakenly associating complexity with linear behavior.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of linear functions but might still struggle with nuanced interpretations of graphs.

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a solid understanding of linear functions and their graphical representation. They should easily identify a straight line as a linear function.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand linear functions but might also be aware of the subtleties in graph representations. They are likely to quickly and accurately identify linear functions.

With these considerations:

**below_basic**: A=40% (seems complex, might think it's linear due to multiple changes), B=30% (U-shape might confuse some), C=20% (recognizing a straight line might be challenging), D=10% (two curves might seem too complex)

**basic**: A=20% (recognize it's not a straight line but might think complex = linear), B=15% (U-shape is recognizable as non-linear), C=60% (clearly a straight line, so likely to choose), D=5% (likely to recognize both as non-linear)

**proficient**: A=5% (easily recognize as non-linear), B=5% (recognize U-shape), C=90% (straight line), D=0% (clearly non-linear)

**advanced**: A=0% (immediately recognize as non-linear), B=0% (recognize as quadratic), C=100% (straight line, no hesitation), D=0% (non-linear, possibly recognizing specific types of curves)

The format requires:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
