## Step 1: Understand the question and the likely misconceptions
The question asks students to expand and simplify \((3y - 4)^2\). A common misconception when expanding squared binomials is to incorrectly apply the formula, often resulting in \(a^2 + b^2\) or \(a^2 - b^2\) instead of the correct \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\). For this specific question, the correct expansion is \((3y)^2 - 2 \cdot 3y \cdot 4 + 4^2 = 9y^2 - 24y + 16\).

## 2: Analyze option A
Option A is \(9y^2 - 16\). This option might appeal to students who mistakenly think \((3y - 4)^2 = (3y)^2 - 4^2\), which is a common error when not applying the correct formula.

## 3: Analyze option B
Option B is \(9y^2 + 16\). This could be a result of a student mistakenly adding the terms instead of subtracting, or simply not understanding how to expand a squared binomial correctly.

## 4: Analyze option C
Option C is \(9y^2 - 24y + 16\), which is the correct expansion and simplification of \((3y - 4)^2\). Students who understand and can correctly apply the formula \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\) will choose this option.

## 5: Analyze option D
Option D is \((3y - 4)(3y - 4)\), which is the original expression before expansion. Some students might choose this because they do not know how to expand it or they recognize it as the original form but fail to simplify.

## 6: Consider student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to struggle significantly with algebraic manipulations. They might choose options that reflect a lack of understanding of both the algebraic process and the formula for expanding squared binomials. Option A (\(9y^2 - 16\)) and Option D (the original expression) might be appealing due to a lack of algebraic skills.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still make simple algebraic mistakes. They could be tempted by options that reflect common misconceptions, such as Option A.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic techniques and are less likely to fall for common misconceptions. They should predominantly choose Option C.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the algebraic techniques but are also likely to apply them efficiently and accurately. They should have no trouble choosing Option C.

## 7: Predict percentages for each ability level
Given the nature of the question and common student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple mistake, thinking it's a difference of squares), B=20% (random or incorrect addition), C=20% (correct but unlikely), D=20% (stuck on original form).
- **Basic**: A=30% (common error), B=15% (mistake), C=40% (correct application), D=15% (less likely to leave it as is).
- **Proficient**: A=10% (occasional slip), B=5% (less likely mistake), C=80% (confident in correct application), D=5% (unlikely to not expand).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (rare error), B=0% (unlikely mistake), C=95% (almost certain correct application), D=0% (would expand correctly).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%
