## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation provided is \(y = 6x\), and we need to find the value of \(x\) when \(y = 0\). This involves substituting \(y = 0\) into the equation and solving for \(x\).

## 2: Solve for \(x\) when \(y = 0\)
Substituting \(y = 0\) into the equation \(y = 6x\), we get:
\[0 = 6x\]
To solve for \(x\), divide both sides by 6:
\[x = 0\]
So, when \(y = 0\), \(x = 0\).

## 3: Analyze the answer choices
Given \(x = 0\) when \(y = 0\), let's look at the answer choices:
- A: \(-6\)
- B: \(0\)
- C: \(\frac{10}{6}\)
- D: There is no possible solution

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations or might not understand the concept of solving for a variable. They might choose an answer that seems plausible or they might not attempt to solve it, potentially selecting D if they think there's no solution or making a random choice.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to substitute \(y = 0\) into the equation and solve for \(x\), but they might make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose B: \(0\) if they understand the direct relationship, but some might mistakenly choose another option if they're unsure or miscalculate.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should easily solve for \(x\) and choose B: \(0\). They understand the equation and can apply it correctly.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only solve for \(x\) correctly but also understand the implications of their solution. They would definitely choose B: \(0\).

## 5: Estimate percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (random guess), B=40% (some understanding but shaky), C=10% (miscalculation), D=30% (think there's no solution).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=2%, D=3%.

## 6: Refine estimates based on common misconceptions and algebraic understanding
Given the simplicity of the question and the direct relationship between \(x\) and \(y\), most students should be able to get it right, especially if they have a basic understanding of algebra.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2% D=3%
