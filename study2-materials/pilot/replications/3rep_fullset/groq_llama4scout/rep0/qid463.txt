To approach this question, let's analyze what it tests and how students of different abilities might respond.

The question tests the understanding of parallel lines in the context of linear equations in slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the slope of the line and \(b\) is the y-intercept. For two lines to be parallel, they must have the same slope (\(m\)) but different y-intercepts (\(b\)).

## Step 1: Understanding the Conditions for Parallel Lines
Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope but different y-intercepts. This means that for equations in the form \(y = mx + b\), if \(m_1 = m_2\) and \(b_1 \neq b_2\), then the lines are parallel.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom says \(y = 2x + 5\) and \(y = 2x - 7\) are parallel. Here, both lines have the same slope (\(m = 2\)) but different y-intercepts (\(b = 5\) and \(b = -7\)). Therefore, Tom is correct.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie says \(y = 2x + 5\) and \(y = 3x + 5\) are parallel. In this case, the lines have different slopes (\(m = 2\) and \(m = 3\)) but the same y-intercept (\(b = 5\)). Since they don't have the same slope, Katie is incorrect.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of slope and y-intercept or might not fully understand what makes lines parallel. They might incorrectly identify parallel lines based on y-intercepts only or get confused by the coefficients. 
  - A (Only Tom): 40% (some recognition of slope)
  - B (Only Katie): 20% (misconception)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 10% (significant misunderstanding)
  - D (Neither is correct): 30% (total confusion or lack of understanding)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple errors.
  - A (Only Tom): 60% (correct identification)
  - B (Only Katie): 20% (common misconception)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 5% (some misunderstanding)
  - D (Neither is correct): 15% (some confusion)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept well and can apply it.
  - A (Only Tom): 80% (correct)
  - B (Only Katie): 5% (minor misconception)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 0% (clear understanding)
  - D (Neither is correct): 15% (unlikely but possible due to carelessness)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also reason through complex scenarios.
  - A (Only Tom): 90% (clearly correct)
  - B (Only Katie): 0% (clear misconception)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 0% (advanced understanding)
  - D (Neither is correct): 10% (extremely unlikely)

## 5: Conclusion
Based on the understanding and likely errors at each level:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
