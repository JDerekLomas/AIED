To approach this question, let's consider the potential pitfalls and the simplicity of the equation given.

The equation provided is \(3 - y = 5\). This is a straightforward linear equation. The task is to solve for \(y\). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Equation
The equation to solve is \(3 - y = 5\). To isolate \(y\), we need to get \(y\) on one side of the equation by itself.

## 2: Solving for \(y\)
Subtract 3 from both sides to get \(-y = 2\). Then, multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \(y\), which gives \(y = -2\).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect handling of the negative sign or not isolating \(y\) properly. However, the simplicity of this equation and the direct method to solve it (\(3 - y = 5 \Rightarrow -y = 5 - 3 \Rightarrow -y = 2 \Rightarrow y = -2\)) make it less prone to errors for students who have a basic understanding of algebra.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations or might not fully understand how to isolate \(y\). They could potentially choose any option, but given the simplicity, some might guess or incorrectly solve it, potentially leading to:
  - A=30% (guessing or incorrect calculation)
  - B=40% (correct solution, but let's assume some struggle)
  - C=15% ( incorrect, possibly from miscalculation)
  - D=15% (incorrect, possibly from miscalculation)

- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to handle simple equations. The correct answer \(y = -2\) should be achievable:
  - A=10% 
  - B=80% 
  - C=5% 
  - D=5%

- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with algebraic equations and should easily solve this:
  - A=5%
  - B=90%
  - C=3%
  - D=2%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are very confident and should have no issues:
  - A=2%
  - B=95%
  - C=2%
  - D=1%

The best answer is B. 

So, in the requested format:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
