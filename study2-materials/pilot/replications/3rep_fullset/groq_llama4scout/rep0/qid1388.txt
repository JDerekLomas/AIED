To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to the concept of the line of symmetry for a quadratic function.

The equation given is \( y = (x + 4)(x - 2) \). This can be expanded to \( y = x^2 + 2x - 8 \), which is a quadratic equation in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \). The line of symmetry (or axis of symmetry) for a quadratic function \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) can be found using the formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).

## Step 1: Finding the Line of Symmetry
First, let's find the equation of the line of symmetry for the given quadratic function. The given function in expanded form is \( y = x^2 + 2x - 8 \). Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \). So, the line of symmetry is \( x = -\frac{2}{2*1} = -1 \).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( y = -8 \). This is incorrect because the line of symmetry for a quadratic function is always a vertical line (equation in the form \( x = c \)), not a horizontal line.
- Option B: \( x = -4 \). This is incorrect as it corresponds to one of the roots of the equation, not the line of symmetry.
- Option C: \( y = -1 \). This is incorrect for the same reason as Option A; the line of symmetry is a vertical line.
- Option D: \( x = -1 \). This matches our calculation for the line of symmetry.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of the line of symmetry or might confuse it with the roots of the equation. They might choose \( x = -4 \) (B) because it's a root, or they might randomly select an option. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 40\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 20\% \).
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still confuse the line of symmetry with other features of the graph. They are more likely to recognize that the line of symmetry is a vertical line but might not calculate it correctly. \( A = 10\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 50\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept and can calculate the line of symmetry. They are likely to choose \( D = x = -1 \) but might have some confusion. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 80\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also apply it quickly and accurately. They are very likely to choose the correct option. \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 0\% \), \( C = 0\% \), \( D = 100\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=10% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
