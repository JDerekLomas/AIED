To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's first analyze the question. The task is to identify the outlier in a set of data that includes fractions and a decimal. The values given are: \( \frac{2}{10} \), \( \frac{9}{50} \), \( \frac{9}{20} \), \( 0.21 \), \( \frac{1}{5} \), and \( \frac{19}{100} \).

## Step 1: Convert all values to a comparable format
To compare these values easily, let's convert them into decimal form:
- \( \frac{2}{10} = 0.2 \)
- \( \frac{9}{50} = 0.18 \)
- \( \frac{9}{20} = 0.45 \)
- \( 0.21 \) is already in decimal form.
- \( \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \)
- \( \frac{19}{100} = 0.19 \)

## 2: Identify the outlier
The outlier is the value that is significantly different from the others. Looking at the decimal values:
- \( 0.18 \), \( 0.19 \), \( 0.2 \), \( 0.2 \), and \( 0.21 \) are close to each other.
- \( 0.45 \) stands out as significantly larger than the others.

## 3: Analyze the difficulty and potential misconceptions
The question requires students to understand what an outlier is (a data point that is significantly different from the others) and to be able to compare different types of numbers (fractions and decimals). A common misconception could be not converting fractions to decimals for comparison or misunderstanding what constitutes an outlier.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with converting fractions to decimals or understanding the concept of an outlier. They might choose randomly or based on superficial observations. Given \( \frac{9}{20} \) is the largest and stands out, but might not be immediately recognizable as an outlier without conversion, there's a chance they might pick an option that seems large or different but not necessarily the correct one. \( \frac{9}{20} \) or \( 0.21 \) might seem like outliers due to being larger, but \( 0.21 \) is closer to the others than \( 0.45 \) is. So, A=20%, B=15%, C=30%, D=35%.

- **Basic:** Students here have a better grasp of fractions and decimals but might still make careless mistakes. They are more likely to convert fractions to decimals for comparison. \( \frac{9}{20} = 0.45 \) clearly stands out. So, A=10%, B=5%, C=10%, D=75%.

- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with fractions, decimals, and identifying outliers. They will easily convert and compare values. \( \frac{9}{20} \) is the clear outlier. So, A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them efficiently. They will quickly identify \( \frac{9}{20} \) as the outlier. So, A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

The best answer is D. 

Below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
Basic: A=10% B=5% C=10% D=75%
Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
