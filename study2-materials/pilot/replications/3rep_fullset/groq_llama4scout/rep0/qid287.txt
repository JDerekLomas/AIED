To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions.

The question revolves around units of time. A common misconception among students is confusing units of time with units of speed or other measurements. Specifically, \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) is a unit of speed, not time, but it can be related to time in the sense that speed is distance over time (\( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} = \mathrm{km} \div \mathrm{h} \)). However, \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) itself is not a unit of time but rather a rate.

Tom says "days" is a unit of time, which is correct. 
Katie says "\( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \)" is a unit of time, which is incorrect because \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) measures speed, not time.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The potential misconception here is that some students might think \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) is related to time and could be considered a unit of time, which would be incorrect.

## 2: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding what constitutes a unit of time. They might incorrectly identify \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) as a unit of time due to a lack of clarity on the distinction between speed and time. So, they might choose B (Only Katie) or C (Both Tom and Katie) because they don't fully grasp the concepts. 
  - A=40% (recognizes days as a unit of time but might not fully understand \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \))
  - B=30% (thinks Katie is correct, indicating confusion)
  - C=20% (both are correct, showing a significant misunderstanding)
  - D=10% (neither is correct, which might be chosen by those who understand neither is appropriate)

## 3: Basic Level Students
Basic level students have a better grasp of units but might still confuse \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) with being a measure of time due to its formulation. They are more likely to correctly identify "days" as a unit of time.
  - A=60% (recognizes Tom's correctness)
  - B=20% (some still confuse \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) with time)
  - C=10% (misunderstanding both)
  - D=10% (correctly identifies neither as a sole unit of time)

## 4: Proficient Students
Proficient students understand that "days" is indeed a unit of time and \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) is not; it's a unit of speed.
  - A=80% (clearly understands Tom is correct)
  - B=5% (very few still confuse \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) with a unit of time)
  - C=5% (very few misunderstand both)
  - D=10% (correct that only Tom is correct)

## 5: Advanced Students
Advanced students have a strong grasp of these concepts and will easily distinguish between units of time and speed.
  - A=90% (confidently choose Tom)
  - B=0% (none confuse \( \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) with time)
  - C=0% (none think both are units of time)
  - D=10% (a small percentage might choose this, but it's essentially about recognizing Tom's correctness)

Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
- basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
- advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
