To approach this question, let's first understand the concept of reflection in a vertical line. When a point is reflected in a vertical line, its x-coordinate changes to be the same distance on the other side of the line, but its y-coordinate remains the same.

## Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
The rectangle is positioned with its right-hand side on the vertical red line. Point P and Point Q are on the red line. 

## 2: Reflection of Points
- Point P is on the red line, so reflecting it across the red line means it stays in the same position because it is on the line of reflection.
- Point Q is also on the red line, so reflecting it across the red line means it stays in the same position for the same reason.

## 3: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom says if you reflect the rectangle in the vertical line, Point P stays in the same position. Given that Point P is on the line of reflection, Tom is correct.

## 4: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie says if you reflect the rectangle in the vertical line, Point Q stays in the same position. Since Point Q is also on the line of reflection, Katie is correct.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding reflections or the coordinates. They might not correctly interpret the positions of P and Q or might misunderstand the concept of reflection. However, given the visual cue that both points are on the line of reflection, a significant portion might still get it right due to the simplicity of the question. 
  - A=10% (misunderstanding reflection concept), B=10% (similarly misinformed), C=60% (correctly understand both stay), D=20% (think neither is correct due to confusion).

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to not fully grasping the reflection concept or misinterpreting the question. 
  - A=5% (less likely to misunderstand), B=5% (similar), C=80% (most understand both points stay), D=10% (some still confused).

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of geometric concepts, including reflections. They should easily understand that both points, being on the line of reflection, do not change position.
  - A=2% (unlikely to make mistake), B=2% (similar), C=90% (accurately understand), D=6% (a few might still be confused).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have an in-depth understanding and can apply concepts easily. They will clearly see that both points are on the line of reflection and thus do not move.
  - A=1% (very unlikely to make mistake), B=1% (similar), C=95% (highly accurate understanding), D=3% (minimal confusion).

## 6: Converting to Requested Format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
- basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- proficient: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
- advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
