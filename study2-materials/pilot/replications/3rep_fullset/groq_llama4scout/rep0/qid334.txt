To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding related to probability scales.

The question provides a probability of \( \frac{1}{5} \) and asks students to locate this value on a probability scale. The probability scale typically ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain), with 0.5 often representing an equal chance.

## Step 1: Understanding the Probability Scale
A standard probability scale is a line segment with 0 at one end (representing an impossible event) and 1 at the other end (representing a certain event). The point 0.5 is in the middle, representing an event with an equal chance of happening or not happening.

## 2: Converting \( \frac{1}{5} \) to a Decimal
To understand where \( \frac{1}{5} \) falls on the scale, converting it to a decimal is helpful. \( \frac{1}{5} \) as a decimal is 0.2. This value is less than 0.5, indicating that the event (picking a green ball) is less likely than not.

## 3: Locating 0.2 on the Probability Scale
- Option A corresponds to 0.
- Option B could reasonably represent a value less than 0.5 but closer to 0.
- Option C might represent a midpoint or a value around 0.5.
- Option D corresponds to 1.

Given that 0.2 is closer to 0 than to 1 and definitely less than 0.5, we would expect students to place it towards the lower end of the scale but not at 0.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with converting fractions to decimals or understanding the concept of probability scales. They might incorrectly place \( \frac{1}{5} \) at 0 (A) or 1 (D) due to a lack of understanding, or they might guess randomly. \( A=40\%, B=20\%, C=20\%, D=20\% \)
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and can convert \( \frac{1}{5} \) to 0.2. They might still make errors in placing it on the scale but are more likely to understand it's not 0 or 1. \( A=10\%, B=60\%, C=20\%, D=10\% \)
- **Proficient:** These students can accurately convert \( \frac{1}{5} \) to 0.2 and understand its position on the scale, likely choosing B. \( A=5\%, B=80\%, C=10\%, D=5\% \)
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the conversion and placement but can also reason about probabilities accurately. They would confidently choose B. \( A=0\%, B=90\%, C=5\%, D=5\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
