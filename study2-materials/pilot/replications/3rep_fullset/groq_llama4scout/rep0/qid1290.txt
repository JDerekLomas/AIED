To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Jo and Paul and the nature of the expressions they are discussing.

Jo claims that there is no value of \( x \) that can make \( (1-x)^{2} \) negative. This statement is true because any real number squared is non-negative. Therefore, \( (1-x)^{2} \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), and it equals 0 only when \( 1-x = 0 \), i.e., \( x = 1 \). So, Jo is correct.

Paul claims that there is no value of \( x \) that can make \( 1-x^{2} \) positive. This statement needs examination. \( 1-x^{2} > 0 \) can be rearranged as \( x^{2} < 1 \). This inequality is satisfied for \( -1 < x < 1 \). Therefore, there are values of \( x \) that can make \( 1-x^{2} \) positive, which means Paul is incorrect.

Given the analysis:
- Jo is correct because \( (1-x)^{2} \) cannot be negative.
- Paul is incorrect because \( 1-x^{2} \) can be positive for \( -1 < x < 1 \).

Thus, the correct answer is A) Only Jo.

Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

### below_basic:
At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and understanding of quadratic expressions. They might not fully understand the implications of squaring a real number or solving simple inequalities.
- A=60% (They might recognize Jo's statement as always true but struggle with Paul's)
- B=20% (Might think Paul is correct due to misunderstanding)
- C=10% (Unlikely to see both as correct given the clear error in Paul's statement)
- D=10% (Might not understand either statement fully)

### basic:
Students at this level have a better grasp of algebra but might still make errors in understanding quadratic expressions and their graphs.
- A=70% (Better understanding that Jo is correct, but might not fully analyze Paul's statement)
- B=15% (Still might be confused about Paul's statement)
- C=5% (Less likely to think both are correct)
- D=10% (Might recognize both have errors but not identify Jo as correct)

### proficient:
Proficient students have a solid understanding of algebra and quadratic equations.
- A=80% (Easily see Jo is correct and can analyze Paul's statement for its flaws)
- B=5% (Recognize Paul's error)
- C=5% (Unlikely to think both are correct given analysis)
- D=10% (Might still be a few who don't fully grasp the implications)

### advanced:
Advanced students not only understand the algebra but can also analyze statements critically.
- A=90% (Easily recognize Jo's correctness and quickly analyze Paul's statement)
- B=0% (Unlikely to think Paul is correct without deeper misunderstanding)
- C=0% (No chance of thinking both are correct)
- D=10% (Might question the absolute nature of the statements but are likely to conclude Jo is correct)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
