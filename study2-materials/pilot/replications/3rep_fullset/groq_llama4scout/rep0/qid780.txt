To approach this question, let's analyze the concepts involved and the potential for misconceptions among students at different ability levels.

The question revolves around the properties of quadrilaterals, specifically one with four equal sides. The key terms here are "arrowhead" and "rhombus." 

- A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides of equal length. 
- An arrowhead, or more formally, a kite, has two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal, which doesn't match the criteria of having four equal sides, although it's a common misconception that might arise from visual or contextual cues.

Given these definitions:

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The misconception here could involve not fully understanding the definition of a rhombus and possibly confusing it with other quadrilaterals like a kite (or arrowhead), which has two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal.

## 2: Analyzing Student Responses
- **Tom says arrowhead:** An arrowhead (or kite) does not have four equal sides; it has two pairs of adjacent equal sides. So, Tom is incorrect.
- **Katie says rhombus:** A rhombus indeed has four equal sides, making Katie correct.

## 3: Predicting Student Errors
- Students who are **below_basic** might not fully understand the definitions of these shapes or might be prone to suggesting any quadrilateral that "looks" right. They might incorrectly agree with Tom or not understand Katie's correctness.
- Students at the **basic** level might have a rudimentary understanding but could still fall into traps, especially if they confuse properties of shapes.
- **Proficient** students should clearly understand the definitions and be less likely to make errors, recognizing Katie's answer as correct and Tom's as incorrect.
- **Advanced** students would not only understand the definitions but also be able to apply them accurately in various contexts.

## 4: Estimating Response Percentages
Given the clarity of the question and the distinct definitions of the shapes:
- **Below_basic:** A=20% (may think an arrowhead has 4 equal sides due to lack of understanding), B=40% (some understanding of rhombus), C=10% (unlikely to see both as correct), D=30% (may not associate either correctly).
- **Basic:** A=10% (less likely to mistakenly think an arrowhead fits), B=70% (recognize rhombus), C=5% (very few would see both as correct), D=15% (some might reject both due to misunderstanding).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (recognize mistake in arrowhead), B=85% (correctly identify rhombus), C=5% (unlikely), D=5% (unlikely to reject both).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no one would mistakenly think an arrowhead is correct), B=95% (confidently select Katie), C=0% (no one thinks both are correct), D=5% (extreme cases, but highly unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
