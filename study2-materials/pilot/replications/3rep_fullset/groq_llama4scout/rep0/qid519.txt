## Step 1: Understand the question and the factorisation process
The question asks for the expression left inside the brackets when \(24abc^{2} - 16b^{2}c\) is fully factorised in the form \(8bc(\square)\). To factorise the given expression, we first find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms \(24abc^{2}\) and \(16b^{2}c\), which is \(8bc\).

## 2: Factorise the given expression
Factorising \(24abc^{2} - 16b^{2}c\) with \(8bc\) as the GCF:
\[24abc^{2} - 16b^{2}c = 8bc(3ac - 2b)\]

## 3: Identify the correct answer
Comparing the factorised form \(8bc(3ac - 2b)\) to the given form \(8bc(\square)\), it's clear that \(\square = 3ac - 2b\). Therefore, the correct answer is B: \(3ac - 2b\).

## 4: Analyse potential misconceptions and student errors
Students might make errors if they incorrectly factorise the expression or misunderstand the concept of greatest common factors. A common mistake could be not fully simplifying or incorrectly identifying the terms to be factored out.

## 5: Consider student ability levels and predicted errors
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and factorisation. They might incorrectly identify the GCF or fail to simplify the expression correctly. Option A (\(8abc\)) might appeal to those who incorrectly include all variables and coefficients. Option D (\(3a - 2\)) might be chosen by those who incorrectly factor or simplify.

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but may still make simple errors. They might choose A if they mistakenly think the entire expression should be divided by \(8bc\), or they might struggle to get the correct form.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students should be able to correctly factorise the expression and identify \(3ac - 2b\) as the correct answer. However, some might be distracted by simpler or more obvious factors, leading to choices like C (\(3ac\)) if they forget to account for the \(-2b\).

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to get the question correct, choosing B (\(3ac - 2b\)), as they have a strong grasp of algebraic manipulations and factorisation techniques.

## 6: Predict percentages for each ability level
Given the nature of the question and potential for error:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (simple, incorrect factor), B=20% (correct, but less likely), C=20% (forgetting one part), D=20% (misunderstanding).
- **Basic:** A=30%, B=60%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
