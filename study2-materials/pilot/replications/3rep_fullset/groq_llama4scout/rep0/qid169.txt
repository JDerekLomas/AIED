To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls or clarity in the formula provided.

The question asks for the formula to calculate the cost \(C\) of hiring Sally the electrician, given a call-out fee of \(£40\) and an hourly rate of \(£15\). The correct formula should account for both the fixed call-out fee and the variable hourly charge.

## Step 1: Understand the Correct Formula
The correct formula to calculate the cost \(C\) for a job that takes \(n\) hours is \(C = 40 + 15n\), because Sally charges a fixed \(£40\) call-out fee plus \(£15\) for each hour \(n\) that the job takes.

## 2: Analyze Each Option
- Option A: \(C = 15n\). This option ignores the call-out fee, suggesting the cost is only based on the hourly rate.
- Option B: \(C = 55n\). This implies a single rate of \(£55\) per hour, combining the call-out fee and the hourly rate incorrectly.
- Option C: \(C = 40 + 15n\). This is the correct formula, including both the call-out fee and the hourly rate.
- Option D: \(C = 40n + 15\). This incorrectly suggests that the call-out fee scales with \(n\) and adds a fixed \(£15\).

## 3: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with forming equations or understanding the components of the cost. They might not fully grasp the concept of a fixed fee plus a variable rate.
  - A: \(60\%\) (simple but incorrect, ignoring the call-out fee)
  - B: \(20\%\) (misinterprets both fees)
  - C: \(15\%\) (correct, but might be challenging for them to derive)
  - D: \(5\%\) (less likely, as it misrepresents both fees)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still fall into common traps.
  - A: \(30\%\) (still a plausible but incorrect option)
  - B: \(15\%\) (less likely, as it seems to overcharge)
  - C: \(45\%\) (correct, as the structure starts to make sense)
  - D: \(10\%\) (misunderstands the application of fees)

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic expressions and the problem context.
  - A: \(5\%\) (unlikely, as they know the call-out fee is important)
  - B: \(5\%\) (seems obviously incorrect)
  - C: \(80\%\) (correct, as it accurately reflects the charges)
  - D: \(10\%\) (a possible mistake, but less likely)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to not only understand but also apply concepts accurately and efficiently.
  - A: \(0\%\) (extremely unlikely)
  - B: \(0\%\) (obviously incorrect)
  - C: \(95\%\) (almost certainly correct, given their level of understanding)
  - D: \(5\%\) (a minor slip, but very unlikely)
