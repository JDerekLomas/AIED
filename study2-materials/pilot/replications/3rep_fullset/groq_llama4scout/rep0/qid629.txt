To approach this question, let's first analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and evaluate their validity.

1. Tom says \( 45 \% > 0.059 \).
   - To compare, convert \( 45 \% \) into a decimal: \( 45 \% = 0.45 \).
   - Since \( 0.45 > 0.059 \), Tom is correct.

2. Katie says \( 45 \% > \frac{16}{31} \).
   - Convert \( 45 \% \) into a decimal: \( 45 \% = 0.45 \).
   - Convert \( \frac{16}{31} \) into a decimal: \( \frac{16}{31} \approx 0.516 \).
   - Since \( 0.45 < 0.516 \), Katie is incorrect.

Given the evaluations:
- Tom is correct.
- Katie is incorrect.

So, the correct answer is A) Only Tom.

Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with converting between percentages, decimals, and fractions, and might not fully understand the comparisons.
- A=60% (They might correctly identify Tom's statement as true but struggle with Katie's)
- B=20% (Might think Katie is right without proper conversion)
- C=10% (Unlikely to see both as correct given the clear distinction)
- D=10% (Might not recognize either as correct due to confusion)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make errors in conversions or comparisons.
- A=70% (Should mostly understand Tom's correctness)
- B=15% (Some might still incorrectly think Katie is right)
- C=5% (Few would think both are correct)
- D=10% (Some confusion about neither being correct)

### proficient
Students here have a solid grasp of percentages, decimals, and fractions, and can compare them accurately.
- A=85% (Most would correctly identify Tom as right and Katie as wrong)
- B=5% (Few would incorrectly think Katie is right)
- C=5% (Very few would mistakenly think both are correct)
- D=5% (Some might mistakenly think neither is correct, but this is less likely)

### advanced
At this level, students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately in various contexts.
- A=95% (Virtually all would correctly say only Tom is right)
- B=0% (Would not mistakenly think Katie is right alone)
- C=0% (Would not think both are correct)
- D=5% (Extremely few, if any, would think neither is correct)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
