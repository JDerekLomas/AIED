To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's first evaluate each option to determine which one equals \(-20\).

## Step 1: Evaluate Option A
Option A: \(2 \times (-2) - (-4) \times 4\)
\(= -4 - (-16)\)
\(= -4 + 16\)
\(= 12\)

## 2: Evaluate Option B
Option B: \(-28 - (-4) \times 2\)
\(= -28 - (-8)\)
\(= -28 + 8\)
\(= -20\)

## 3: Evaluate Option C
Option C: \((-5)^2 + 5\)
\(= 25 + 5\)
\(= 30\)

## 4: Evaluate Option D
Option D: \((-42) \div (-2) + 1\)
\(= 21 + 1\)
\(= 22\)

## 5: Identifying the Correct Option
Only Option B equals \(-20\), making it the correct answer.

## 6: Analyzing Potential Errors
- **Option A** might confuse students who incorrectly apply the order of operations or mishandle negative numbers, but it yields a positive result, not \(-20\).
- **Option C** is straightforward and yields a positive result far from \(-20\), likely to be recognized as incorrect by most students.
- **Option D** also yields a positive result, far from \(-20\), and is less likely to be chosen by students who perform the calculation correctly.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with order of operations and handling negative numbers. They might mistakenly choose A, C, or D due to calculation errors. Let's assume:
  - A: 30% (due to incorrect calculations)
  - B: 20% (some might get it right by chance or correct calculation)
  - C: 20% (simple addition error)
  - D: 30% (division and addition errors)

- **Basic:** Students here have a better grasp but might still make errors. Let's assume:
  - A: 20% (common mistake in order of operations)
  - B: 40% (recognize correct calculation)
  - C: 15% (still making basic errors)
  - D: 25% (some calculation errors)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make errors. Let's assume:
  - A: 5% (minor errors)
  - B: 80% (most recognize correct calculation)
  - C: 5% (rare errors)
  - D: 10% (occasional miscalculation)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly unlikely to make errors. Let's assume:
  - A: 0% (no errors expected)
  - B: 95% (nearly all get it right)
  - C: 0% (no errors)
  - D: 5% (extremely rare errors)

## 8: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
- proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
- advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
