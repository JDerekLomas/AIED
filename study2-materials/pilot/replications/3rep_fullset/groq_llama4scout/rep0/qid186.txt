To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of writing "Fifty-six thousand and thirteen" in digits, let's analyze the potential misconceptions and the clarity of the question.

The correct answer is C) \( 56013 \), as "fifty-six thousand" translates to \( 56000 \) and "thirteen" adds \( 13 \) to that, making \( 56013 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
- A common misconception might be misunderstanding how to break down the number into its thousands and units components. For example, some might write \( 56 \) thousand as \( 56 \) and then incorrectly add \( 13 \) to get \( 5613 \) (Option A), or mistakenly place the \( 13 \) in the hundreds place or misinterpret the thousands.
- Another error could be adding an extra zero or misplacing digits, leading to options like B) \( 56030 \) or D) \( 560013 \).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A (\( 5613 \)) might appeal to students who misunderstand the thousand separator or mistakenly omit the thousands.
- Option B (\( 56030 \)) could be chosen by students who correctly understand "fifty-six thousand" but mistakenly place the "thirteen" in the tens place.
- Option D (\( 560013 \)) seems less likely as it implies a much larger number than intended, possibly chosen by those who misinterpret "thousand" or add extra zeros.

## 3: Ability Levels
- **below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with place value and writing numbers in digits. They might choose A) \( 5613 \) because they don't fully understand the "thousand" part, leading to A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make errors. They are more likely to understand "thousand" but might misplace numbers, so A=20%, B=25%, C=45%, D=10%.
- **proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of place value and are less likely to make simple errors. They should mostly choose C) \( 56013 \), with some possibly choosing B due to attention slips, so A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and are unlikely to make errors. They should almost uniformly choose C) \( 56013 \), with very few opting for incorrect answers, so A=1%, B=2%, C=96%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%
