To approach this question, let's analyze each option given and determine the likelihood of students at different ability levels (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) selecting each option as not possible for a polygon.

## Step 1: Understanding Rotation Symmetry and Line Symmetry
- Rotation symmetry order \(n\) means that the polygon looks the same after a rotation of \(360^\circ/n\).
- A line of symmetry is a line that divides the polygon into two congruent parts that are mirror images of each other.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A: Rotation symmetry order \(3\) and \(0\) lines of symmetry. 
A polygon with rotation symmetry order \(3\) is an equilateral triangle, which has \(3\) lines of symmetry, not \(0\). Thus, this combination is not possible.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B: Rotation symmetry order \(1\) and \(2\) lines of symmetry. 
A rotation symmetry order of \(1\) means the polygon only looks the same after a full \(360^\circ\) rotation, implying it has no rotational symmetry other than the identity. However, having \(2\) lines of symmetry is possible (e.g., an isosceles triangle or a rectangle), but a rotation symmetry order of \(1\) essentially describes any shape that doesn't have rotational symmetry. This seems plausible but actually, any polygon with 2 lines of symmetry will have a rotation symmetry order greater than 1 if it's not a line (e.g., a rectangle has rotation symmetry order 2), but specific cases like an isosceles triangle could mislead. The statement could be confusing because if a shape has 2 lines of symmetry, it typically will have a rotation symmetry order > 1.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C: Rotation symmetry order \(4\) and \(4\) lines of symmetry. 
This is possible for a square, which has rotation symmetry order \(4\) and \(4\) lines of symmetry.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D: Rotation symmetry order \(2\) and \(0\) lines of symmetry. 
A polygon with rotation symmetry order \(2\) looks the same after a \(180^\circ\) rotation. For it to have \(0\) lines of symmetry is unusual because most shapes with rotation symmetry order \(2\) (like a rectangle or a rhombus) have at least \(2\) lines of symmetry, but theoretically, a polygon that is very irregular could have rotation symmetry order \(2\) without any lines of symmetry.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding symmetry. They might incorrectly identify possibilities based on limited understanding.
  - A: High chance of selecting as not possible because they understand triangles have symmetry.
  - B: Could be selected as not possible due to confusion over symmetry types.
  - C: Less likely to choose as not possible since they might not fully understand the implications.
  - D: Might choose as possible due to misunderstanding.

- **Basic**: 
  - A: Likely to choose as not possible.
  - B: Might choose as not possible due to some understanding of symmetry.
  - C: Less likely to choose as not possible.
  - D: Could see as possible.

- **Proficient**:
  - A: Definitely not possible.
  - B: Not possible because 2 lines of symmetry imply a rotation symmetry > 1.
  - C: Possible.
  - D: Possible.

- **Advanced**:
  - A: Clearly not possible.
  - B: Not possible, understanding the relationship between symmetry and rotation.
  - C: Possible.
  - D: Possible.

## 7: Assigning Percentages
Assuming the understanding and common misconceptions:
- **Below_basic**: A=80% B=60% C=30% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=90% B=50% C=20% D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=95% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=98% B=90% C=2% D=2%

The best answer is B.
