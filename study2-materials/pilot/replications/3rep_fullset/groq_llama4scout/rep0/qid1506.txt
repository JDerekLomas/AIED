To solve this, let's consider what the quadratic formula is and how it's applied. The quadratic formula to solve equations of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by:
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]

For the given equation \(2x^2 - 8x + 7 = 0\), we have \(a = 2\), \(b = -8\), and \(c = 7\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula gives:
\[x = \frac{-(-8) \pm \sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 7}}{2 \cdot 2}\]
\[x = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 56}}{4}\]
\[x = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{8}}{4}\]

Let's examine the options with this correct substitution in mind:

A: \(-8 \pm \frac{\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(2)(7)}}{2(2)}\) - Incorrect because of the \(-8\) and the lack of division by \(2a\) properly.
B: \(8 \pm \frac{\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(2)(7)}}{2(2)}\) - Incorrect due to the \(+8\) and the presentation.
C: \(\frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(2)(7)}}{2(2)}\) - Incorrect because it uses \(-8\) instead of \(8\).
D: \(\frac{8 \pm \sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(2)(7)}}{2(2)}\) - Correct, as it properly substitutes \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the quadratic formula.

Given the standard form of the quadratic equation and its solutions, let's analyze the potential for student errors:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with substituting into the formula and could easily make errors in handling the negative signs or the structure of the formula. They might not recognize the correct form of the quadratic formula. 
  - A: 30% (misinterprets the -b part)
  - B: 20% (similar to A, but with incorrect handling of b)
  - C: 30% (correctly identifies the need for division by 2a but mishandles b)
  - D: 20% (fully correct substitution)

- **Basic:** At this level, students are familiar with the quadratic formula but might make careless mistakes.
  - A: 15% 
  - B: 10% 
  - C: 20% 
  - D: 55% 

- **Proficient:** Students here are expected to apply the formula accurately and understand its components.
  - A: 5% 
  - B: 5% 
  - C: 10% 
  - D: 80% 

- **Advanced:** These students are likely to understand the formula well and apply it accurately without errors.
  - A: 0% 
  - B: 0% 
  - C: 5% 
  - D: 95% 

So, considering typical student performance and potential for error:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=20% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
