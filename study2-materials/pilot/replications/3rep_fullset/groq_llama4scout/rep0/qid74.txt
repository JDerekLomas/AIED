To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required for each option.

The question requires students to identify which equation has no real solutions. This involves understanding the nature of solutions for quadratic and cubic equations.

## Step 1: Understanding the Equations
- Option A: \( t^{2} - 45 = 0 \) has real solutions because \( t^{2} = 45 \) yields \( t = \pm\sqrt{45} \).
- Option B: \( t^{2} - 45 = -45 \) simplifies to \( t^{2} = 0 \), which has one real solution, \( t = 0 \).
- Option C: \( t^{3} = -45 \) has one real solution, \( t = -\sqrt[3]{45} \).
- Option D: \( t^{2} = -45 \) has no real solutions because the square of any real number is non-negative.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the properties of even and odd exponents. For even exponents (like \( t^{2} \)), any real number squared is positive (or zero), implying that a negative result is impossible. For odd exponents (like \( t^{3} \)), any real number cubed can yield a negative result.

## 3: Ability Level Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and understanding of exponents. They might incorrectly assume all equations have solutions or not fully understand the implications of negative numbers under square roots.
  - A: 20% (some might think it has no solution due to confusion)
  - B: 20% (might think it has no solution if they can't solve it)
  - C: 30% (might think it has no solution)
  - D: 30% (might recognize it has no real solutions but not choose it correctly)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make errors in applying concepts to different types of equations.
  - A: 5% (they should know it has solutions)
  - B: 5% (should see it simplifies to \( t^{2} = 0 \))
  - C: 10% (should recognize it has a real solution)
  - D: 80% (should recognize it has no real solutions)

- **Proficient**: Students at this level should reliably solve and understand the nature of solutions for these types of equations.
  - A: 2% (know it has solutions)
  - B: 2% (know it has a solution)
  - C: 5% (know it has a solution)
  - D: 91% (clearly identify it has no real solutions)

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand but can apply their knowledge to complex situations and are less likely to make careless errors.
  - A: 1% (confident it has solutions)
  - B: 1% (confident it has a solution)
  - C: 2% (confident it has a solution)
  - D: 96% (confidently identify it has no real solutions)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=5% D=91%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=2% D=96%
