## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the equation of a line with a gradient of \(4\) that passes through the point \((1,9)\). The general equation of a line can be given by \(y = mx + c\), where \(m\) is the gradient and \(c\) is the y-intercept.

## 2: Identifying the Gradient
The gradient, \(m\), is given as \(4\). So, the equation starts as \(y = 4x + c\).

## 3: Finding the Y-Intercept
To find \(c\), we substitute the given point \((1,9)\) into the equation: \(9 = 4(1) + c\). Solving for \(c\), we get \(9 = 4 + c\), which simplifies to \(c = 5\).

## 4: Writing the Equation of the Line
Substituting \(c = 5\) into the equation \(y = 4x + c\), we get \(y = 4x + 5\). This means the correct answer is B: \(y = 4x + 5\).

## 5: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve misusing the point-gradient form of a line or confusing the gradient with the y-intercept. However, given that the gradient is clearly provided and the point is given, students who understand the basic equation of a line and can substitute values into it should find this straightforward.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of the equation of a line or substituting into an equation. They might incorrectly use the point as the y-intercept (C: \(y = 4x + 9\)) or confuse the gradient with the coefficient of \(x\) in a different form (D: \(y = 9x + 4\)). Option A (\(y = 4x + 8\)) could also be a guess. So, below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of the equation of a line but might make simple algebraic errors. They are likely to recognize the form \(y = mx + c\) but might struggle with rearranging or substituting correctly. So, they might choose B correctly but also have a chance of selecting A or C due to minor errors. So, basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%.

- **Proficient**: These students understand the equation of a line and can apply it accurately. They should easily identify B as the correct answer with minimal chance of error. So, proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also manipulate equations with ease. They should almost exclusively choose B, with very little chance of selecting incorrect options. So, advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
