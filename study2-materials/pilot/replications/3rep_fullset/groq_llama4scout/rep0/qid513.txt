To approach this question, let's first analyze the equation and the steps provided:

The original equation is \(15 = 2p - 4\).

## Step 1: Evaluate Step 1
To check Step 1, we add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \(p\):
\[15 + 4 = 2p - 4 + 4\]
\[19 = 2p\]
So, Step 1 should be \(19 = 2p\), not \(11 = 2p\), which means Step 1 as given is incorrect.

## Step 2: Evaluate Step 2
Given that Step 1 incorrectly states \(11 = 2p\), let's see what happens in Step 2 based on that incorrect step:
If \(11 = 2p\), then \(p = \frac{11}{2}\) or \(5.5\), not \(22 = p\). However, to assess the correctness of the step as presented, if we were to follow from a correct \(19 = 2p\), then:
\[p = \frac{19}{2} = 9.5\]
So, Step 2 as presented (\(22 = p\)) is clearly incorrect based on the flawed Step 1.

## 3: Assessing Student Understanding
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly validate steps without checking the math. Given the straightforward nature of the errors, most might realize both steps are wrong, but some could mistakenly think one is right. 
  - Expect a high percentage to choose D, with some spread to A or B due to partial understanding or incorrect calculations.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might struggle with multi-step problems or checking work. They should see the error in Step 1 but might get confused.
  - Likely, most would choose D, with a smaller percentage possibly choosing A, thinking only the first manipulation could be considered, albeit incorrectly.

- **Proficient**: Students with a stronger grasp of algebra should easily spot the mistakes. Step 1 is incorrect because it doesn't add 4 to both sides properly, and Step 2 misinterprets the result.
  - Expect a high percentage to choose D, as they should clearly see both steps are incorrect.

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the algebra but can also analyze and critique given solutions. They would immediately identify both steps as flawed.
  - Virtually all would choose D, as the errors are transparent.

Given these considerations and typical student performance:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
basic: A=15% B=5% C=5% D=75%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=3% D=90%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%
