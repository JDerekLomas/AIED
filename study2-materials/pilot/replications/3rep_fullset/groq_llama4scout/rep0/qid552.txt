To approach this question, let's first analyze what is being tested: the ability to identify which of the given quadratic equations has exactly one solution. A quadratic equation \(at^2 + bt + c = 0\) has exactly one solution when its discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\) equals 0.

## Step 1: Analyze Option A
Option A is \(t^{2} - 16 = 0\). This can be solved as \(t^2 = 16\), which gives \(t = \pm 4\). So, it has two solutions.

## 2: Analyze Option B
Option B is \(t^{2} - 16t = 0\). Factoring out \(t\), we get \(t(t - 16) = 0\), which gives \(t = 0\) or \(t = 16\). So, it has two solutions.

## 3: Analyze Option C
Option C is \(t^{2} - 8t - 16 = 0\). We can solve this using the quadratic formula, \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -8\), and \(c = -16\). The discriminant \(D = (-8)^2 - 4(1)(-16) = 64 + 64 = 128\). Since \(D > 0\), it has two solutions.

## 4: Analyze Option D
Option D is \(t^{2} - 8t + 16 = 0\). This can be factored as \((t - 4)^2 = 0\), which gives \(t = 4\). So, it has exactly one solution.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with solving quadratic equations or understanding the concept of solutions. They might be confused by the format of the equations and less likely to correctly identify the option with one solution. Given the simplicity of the equations, they might mistakenly choose based on superficial characteristics. \(A=30\%\) \(B=25\%\) \(C=20\%\) \(D=25\%\)

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of quadratic equations but might not fully grasp the conditions for one solution. They could potentially solve simple equations like D but might be unsure about the others. \(A=20\%\) \(B=20\%\) \(C=15\%\) \(D=45\%\)

- **Proficient**: Students here are more likely to understand the conditions for a quadratic equation to have one solution (discriminant equals 0). They should easily identify option D and possibly verify the others. \(A=5\%\) \(B=5\%\) \(C=10\%\) \(D=80\%\)

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concept but can also quickly analyze each option. They would easily solve or reason about each equation. \(A=0\%\) \(B=0\%\) \(C=0\%\) \(D=100\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=15% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
