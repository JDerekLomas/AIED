## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a horizontal blue bar divided into 5 equal sections, with each section labelled with \( \mathrm{M} \). A curly bracket shows that 4 of the sections sum to 420. The task is to find the value of \( \mathrm{M} \).

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception could be that students might think the curly bracket implies a part of the bar, not necessarily 4 full sections, or they might misinterpret the equal division of the bar into sections labelled \( \mathrm{M} \). However, the question seems straightforward as it clearly states that 4 sections equal 420.

## 3: Solving the Question
To find \( \mathrm{M} \), if 4 sections equal 420 and all sections are equal, then \( 4\mathrm{M} = 420 \). Solving for \( \mathrm{M} \) gives \( \mathrm{M} = 420 / 4 = 105 \).

## 4: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic division or understanding of the question. They might choose \( \mathrm{D} \) (1680) because it's the total for all 5 sections if they mistakenly think the 420 is for one section, or they might not understand the question at all and pick randomly. \( \mathrm{A} = 40\% \) (correct but challenging), \( \mathrm{B} = 10\% \), \( \mathrm{C} = 10\% \), \( \mathrm{D} = 40\% \).

- **Basic**: Students here should understand basic math operations but might make simple errors. They are likely to get it right or make a simple calculation mistake. \( \mathrm{A} = 70\% \), \( \mathrm{B} = 10\% \), \( \mathrm{C} = 5\% \), \( \mathrm{D} = 15\% \).

- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve the problem with minimal chance of error. \( \mathrm{A} = 90\% \), \( \mathrm{B} = 5\% \), \( \mathrm{C} = 3\% \), \( \mathrm{D} = 2\% \).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level would almost certainly solve the problem correctly without any errors. \( \mathrm{A} = 98\% \), \( \mathrm{B} = 1\% \), \( \mathrm{C} = 0.5\% \), \( \mathrm{D} = 0.5\% \).

## 5: Converting to Requested Format
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=10% C=10% D=40%
- **basic**: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced**: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The best answer is A.
