To tackle this question, let's analyze the potential difficulties and misconceptions associated with it, particularly focusing on the multiplication of two-digit numbers and the specific query about the ones/units column of the product.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the digit in the ones/units column of the product \(58 \times 22\). To find this, one needs to multiply 58 by 22 and then identify the units digit of the result.

## 2: Multiplication Process
Multiplying \(58 \times 22\) can be broken down into steps:
1. \(58 \times 20 = 1160\)
2. \(58 \times 2 = 116\)
3. Adding them together: \(1160 + 116 = 1276\)

## 3: Identifying the Units Digit
The units digit of \(1276\) is \(6\).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect multiplication or a misunderstanding of place value. However, the question specifically asks for the units digit, which simplifies the task to just considering the units digits of the numbers being multiplied: \(8 \times 2 = 16\), and the units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts or understanding the concept of units digits. They might not accurately calculate \(8 \times 2\) or might not understand what the question is asking. Given the simplicity of \(8 \times 2\), but potential confusion about what is being asked, there's a chance they might get it wrong. \(A = 60\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic multiplication but might make careless errors. They should easily calculate \(8 \times 2 = 16\), so \(A = 80\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students are confident with multiplication and understand place value. They will accurately find \(8 \times 2 = 16\), and thus the units digit is \(6\). \(A = 95\%\), \(B = 2\%\), \(C = 1\%\), \(D = 2\%\).
- **Advanced**: For advanced students, this question is straightforward. They will quickly and accurately determine the units digit. \(A = 98\%\), \(B = 1\%\), \(C = 0.5\%\), \(D = 0.5\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
