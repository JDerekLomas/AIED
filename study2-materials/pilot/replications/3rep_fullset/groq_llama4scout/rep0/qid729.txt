## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The question provides a table of values for the equation \( y = 2x + c \) and asks to find the value that should replace the star (⭐) for \( x = 3 \). The given table is:
\[ \begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l}
x & & 0 & 3 \\
\hline
y & -5 & -3 & ⭐
\end{tabular} \]
We need to determine \( c \) and then find \( y \) when \( x = 3 \).

## 2: Determine the value of \( c \) using given points
Using the point \( (0, -3) \), we substitute \( x = 0 \) and \( y = -3 \) into \( y = 2x + c \) to find \( c \):
\[ -3 = 2(0) + c \]
\[ -3 = c \]
So, \( c = -3 \).

## 3: Verify \( c \) with another point and calculate \( y \) for \( x = 3 \)
Using the point \( (x, -5) \) is not directly helpful without \( x \), but we can verify \( c \) with \( (0, -3) \) which we've done. Let's use \( x = 0 \) and \( y = -3 \) to confirm and then find \( y \) for \( x = 3 \):
Given \( c = -3 \), the equation is \( y = 2x - 3 \).

## 4: Calculate \( y \) for \( x = 3 \)
Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( y = 2x - 3 \):
\[ y = 2(3) - 3 \]
\[ y = 6 - 3 \]
\[ y = 3 \]

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with substituting values into the equation or understanding the concept of \( c \) in \( y = mx + c \). They might incorrectly calculate or not use given points effectively. Option B (3) seems correct based on calculation, but let's assume some errors: A=20% (random guess), B=50% (got it right), C=15% (thinking it's a harder calculation), D=15% (another guess).
- **Basic**: Students understand the equation but might make calculation errors or not verify their \( c \) value strongly. They are likely to get it right or make simple mistakes: A=10%, B=70%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Students can apply the formula correctly and verify their answers. They should mostly get it right: A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students not only apply the formula but also understand the implications of \( c \) and can work backward easily. They are very likely to get it right: A=2%, B=90%, C=4%, D=4%.

## 6: Assign percentages
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=50% C=15% D=15%
- **basic**: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=2% B=90% C=4% D=4%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=50% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=4% D=4%
