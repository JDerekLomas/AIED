To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( (-3)+(-5)= \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question tests the understanding of adding negative numbers. A common misconception is that students might add the numbers and then apply the negative sign incorrectly or forget to add the negatives properly.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
- A common error is to simply add the numbers without considering the signs, which could lead to \( -3 + (-5) = -3 + 5 = 2 \) (option A), but this doesn't account for the correct handling of two negative numbers.
- Another error could be mistakenly thinking that adding two negative numbers results in a positive (which would not apply here directly but could influence incorrect calculations).
- The correct calculation involves adding the two negative numbers, which results in \( -3 + (-5) = -8 \) (option D).

## 2: Analyzing Option Choices
- **Option A (2):** This would be incorrect because adding two negative numbers does not yield a positive number. Students might get this if they mistakenly ignore the negative signs or misapply operations.
- **Option B (-2):** This seems like an incorrect middle ground and doesn't result from a straightforward mistake in adding two negatives.
- **Option C (8):** This could result from incorrectly adding the absolute values of the numbers and then possibly misapplying the sign.
- **Option D (-8):** This is the correct answer.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **below_basic:** Students at this level might struggle significantly with the concept of adding negative numbers. They might incorrectly add or subtract without properly accounting for the negative signs. 
  - A=30% (simple addition mistake), B=10% (random guess), C=20% (misconception of adding absolute values), D=40% (some understanding of negative number addition).
- **basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding but might still make errors. 
  - A=20% (mistake in handling negatives), B=5% (near correct but wrong), C=15% (misconception), D=60% (correct understanding).
- **proficient:** Proficient students understand the rules of adding negative numbers.
  - A=5% (occasional slip), B=2% (error), C=3% (rare misconception), D=90% (correct).
- **advanced:** Advanced students are very familiar with these operations and are less likely to make errors.
  - A=1% (rare mistake), B=1% (extremely rare error), C=1% (misconception unlikely), D=97% (strong understanding).

## 4: Final Predictions
Given the question and typical student errors:
- **below_basic:** A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
- **basic:** A=20% B=5% C=15% D=60%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=2% C=3% D=90%
- **advanced:** A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%

The best answer is D.
