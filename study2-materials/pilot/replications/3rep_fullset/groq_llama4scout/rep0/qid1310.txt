To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question step by step.

The question requires the application of the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). The correct calculation to do first is inside the parentheses, specifically \(0.2 + 0.4\), because it is the innermost operation.

## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
The order of operations dictates that we perform operations inside parentheses first. In the given expression \(((0.5 \div(0.2+0.4)-0.3) \times 0.6)\), the first step is to calculate \(0.2 + 0.4\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be to start with \(0.5 \div 0.2\) because it involves division, which some might mistakenly prioritize over addition inside parentheses. However, the correct approach is to evaluate the expression inside the innermost parentheses first.

## 3: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \(0.5 \div 0.2\) might appeal to those who incorrectly prioritize division over addition within parentheses.
- Option B: \(0.2+0.4\) is the correct first step according to the order of operations.
- Option C: \(0.4-0.3\) is incorrect because \(0.4\) is not an initial part of the expression to be evaluated; it's part of a larger expression that hasn't been simplified yet.
- Option D: \(0.3 \times 0.6\) is clearly incorrect as it doesn't even relate to the initial steps of simplifying inside the parentheses.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the order of operations and could be easily misled by operations that seem more straightforward, such as division or multiplication. They might choose A or D due to confusion. B might be chosen by those who have a basic understanding of following rules but could still be uncertain. 
  - Below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%

- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a better grasp of basic mathematical operations and some understanding of the order of operations. They are likely to choose B but might still be tempted by A.
  - Basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%

- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to have a solid understanding of the order of operations and should overwhelmingly choose B. 
  - Proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the order of operations but are also less likely to make careless mistakes. They should almost unanimously choose B.
  - Advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
