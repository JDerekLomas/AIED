To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of simplifying the fraction \(\frac{9}{12}\), let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks to simplify the fraction \(\frac{9}{12}\). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9 and 12 is 3. Therefore, to simplify, we divide both numerator and denominator by 3, resulting in \(\frac{9 \div 3}{12 \div 3} = \frac{3}{4}\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception in simplifying fractions is not finding the greatest common divisor or not dividing both the numerator and the denominator by this divisor. Another misconception could be simplifying incorrectly, such as reducing the fraction but not using the greatest common divisor.

## 3: Analyzing Option A (\(\frac{3}{6}\))
To get \(\frac{3}{6}\), one might incorrectly simplify by dividing the numerator and denominator by different numbers or not fully simplifying. For example, dividing both by 3 gives \(\frac{3}{4}\), but if one stops at dividing the numerator and denominator by a smaller factor (like 3) without checking for further simplification, they might mistakenly think \(\frac{3}{4}\) needs to be expressed as \(\frac{3}{6}\) by some incorrect operation.

## 4: Analyzing Option B (\(\frac{2}{6}\))
This option seems unrelated to a straightforward simplification error from \(\frac{9}{12}\), as there's no obvious simple factor that would lead directly to this from \(\frac{9}{12}\) without complex incorrect operations.

## 5: Analyzing Option C (\(\frac{3}{4}\))
This is the correct simplification. A student who understands how to find the GCD and simplify fractions should choose this option.

## 6: Analyzing Option D (\(\frac{9}{12}\))
Choosing this option might indicate that the student does not know how to simplify fractions or does not see the need to simplify.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand fraction simplification. They might choose D (\(\frac{9}{12}\)) because they don't know better, or they might make a random choice. Option C (\(\frac{3}{4}\)) seems unlikely to be chosen by many, but some might get it right by chance or very basic understanding.

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of fractions. They are likely to attempt simplification. The most common error would be not simplifying fully or incorrectly simplifying. Option A (\(\frac{3}{6}\)) could be a choice for those who simplify but don't check if it can be reduced further. However, most should be able to get \(\frac{3}{4}\).

- **Proficient:** Students here are expected to simplify fractions correctly. Therefore, most should choose C (\(\frac{3}{4}\)).

- **Advanced:** These students not only simplify correctly but might also recognize \(\frac{3}{4}\) as a common fraction. They are very unlikely to choose incorrect options.

## 8: Assigning Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (incorrect but simplified), B=10% (unlikely), C=20% (correct but by chance), D=50% (no simplification).
- **Basic:** A=30% (common mistake), B=5% (unlikely), C=60% (correct), D=5% (understanding but not executing).
- **Proficient:** A=10% (mistake), B=0% (very unlikely), C=90% (correct), D=0% (should understand simplification).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (unlikely), B=0% (very unlikely), C=100% (correct), D=0% (understand and execute perfectly).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=20% D=50%
basic: A=30% B=5% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=0% C=90% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
