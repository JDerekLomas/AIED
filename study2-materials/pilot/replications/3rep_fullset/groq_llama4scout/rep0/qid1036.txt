## Step 1: Understand the question and the shape described
The question presents a triangular prism with specific dimensions: the length of the prism is 6cm, and the triangular face is a right-angled triangle with base 4cm, height 3cm, and longest edge 5cm. The task is to determine which of the marked lengths is not needed when calculating the volume of this shape.

## 2: Recall the formula for the volume of a triangular prism
The volume \(V\) of a triangular prism is given by the formula \(V = A \times l\), where \(A\) is the area of the triangular face and \(l\) is the length of the prism. For a right-angled triangle, the area \(A\) can be calculated using \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).

## 3: Apply the volume formula to the given shape
Given the triangular face is a right-angled triangle with base 4cm and height 3cm, the area \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 3 = 6\) square cm. The length \(l\) of the prism is 6cm. Thus, the volume \(V = 6 \times 6 = 36\) cubic cm.

## 4: Determine which length is not needed for the volume calculation
To calculate the volume, we need the area of the triangular face (which requires the base and height of the triangle, 4cm and 3cm) and the length of the prism (6cm). The longest edge of the triangular face, which is 5cm, is not required for calculating the volume because we only need the base and height of the triangular face to find its area.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand the concept of volume and the necessary dimensions. They might randomly select an option or choose based on a misconception. Given the straightforward nature of the question, some might still get it right by chance or if they recall the formula correctly. However, a significant portion might choose the longest side (C) because it's not used in basic area calculations and they might think it's irrelevant. \( A=20\% B=20\% C=40\% D=20\% \)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of geometry and formulas. They are likely to understand that the volume of a triangular prism requires the area of the base and the length. They might still be confused about which specific measurements are needed but are less likely to make random guesses. \( A=15\% B=15\% C=60\% D=10\% \)

- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with the formula for the volume of a triangular prism and understand that only the base, height of the triangular face, and the length of the prism are needed. They will likely identify that the 5cm length (the hypotenuse of the triangular face) is not needed. \( A=5\% B=5\% C=80\% D=10\% \)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of geometric principles and are highly unlikely to make mistakes in identifying necessary dimensions for volume calculations. They will easily recognize that the hypotenuse (5cm) of the triangular face is not needed. \( A=0\% B=0\% C=90\% D=10\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
