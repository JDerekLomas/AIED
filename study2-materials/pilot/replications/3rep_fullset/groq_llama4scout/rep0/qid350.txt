To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing: the concept of complementary probabilities. The probability of an event occurring plus the probability of the event not occurring equals 1. Therefore, if the probability of an event occurring is \( \frac{2}{7} \), the probability of it not occurring is \( 1 - \frac{2}{7} = \frac{5}{7} \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the probability of an event not occurring, given that the probability of it occurring is \( \frac{2}{7} \). This is a straightforward calculation: \( 1 - \frac{2}{7} = \frac{7}{7} - \frac{2}{7} = \frac{5}{7} \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the probability of the event happening with the probability of it not happening, or incorrectly calculating the complement. However, given the simplicity of the numbers and the directness of the question, it's likely that most students, even at lower ability levels, can compute \( 1 - \frac{2}{7} \) correctly.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( \frac{2}{7} \) repeats the probability of the event occurring, which is incorrect for the probability of the event not occurring.
- Option B: \( \frac{5}{7} \) is the correct answer, as calculated.
- Option C: \( 5 \) is clearly incorrect because probabilities must be between 0 and 1.
- Option D: \( \frac{2}{5} \) is also incorrect and doesn't relate to the simple complement calculation.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic fraction calculations or understanding what the question asks. They might be tempted by A because it directly relates to information given in the question. Expect a higher error rate, so A=40%, B=30%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** Students here should have a grasp of fractions and basic probability concepts. They might still make simple mistakes but are more likely to choose B. So, A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily calculate the complement and choose B. Expect B=80%, with small percentages for the incorrect options, so A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level will almost certainly choose B, with very few errors. So, A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
