To approach this question, let's first analyze the mathematical concepts involved and then consider how students at different ability levels might respond.

The question revolves around the properties of exponents, specifically the power of a power rule and the relationship between different bases.

1. **Jo's statement**: \(9^{4} = 3^{8}\). To assess this, we can express 9 as \(3^{2}\). So, \(9^{4} = (3^{2})^{4} = 3^{2 \times 4} = 3^{8}\). Therefore, Jo is correct.

2. **Paul's statement**: \(9^{4} = 3^{2} \times 3^{2}\). This can be simplified to \(9^{4} = 3^{2+2} = 3^{4}\). Since \(9^{4} = (3^{2})^{4} = 3^{8}\) and not \(3^{4}\), Paul is incorrect.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is A) Only Jo.

Now, let's consider how students at different ability levels might respond:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with exponent rules and the relationship between different bases. They might not correctly apply the power of a power rule or might confuse the rules. 
  - A: 20% (some might guess Jo is right by chance or misunderstanding)
  - B: 15% (might think Paul is right due to confusion with exponent rules)
  - C: 10% (unlikely to see both as correct due to the clear mistake in one)
  - D: 55% (most might realize neither is correct or be completely unsure)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic exponent rules but might apply them inconsistently or struggle with more complex relationships.
  - A: 40% (start to understand Jo's correctness)
  - B: 25% (still might think Paul has a point)
  - C: 15% (some might incorrectly think both are right)
  - D: 20% (might see that Paul is wrong but be unsure about Jo)

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid understanding of exponent rules and can apply them correctly.
  - A: 60% (recognize Jo's statement as correct)
  - B: 10% (unlikely to think Paul is right)
  - C: 20% (some might mistakenly think both are correct)
  - D: 10% (few would think neither is correct)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the rules but can also apply them in complex situations and reason about the correctness of statements.
  - A: 80% (clearly see Jo's correctness and Paul's mistake)
  - B: 5% (very few would mistakenly think Paul is right)
  - C: 10% (unlikely to think both are correct)
  - D: 5% (very few would think neither is correct)

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
