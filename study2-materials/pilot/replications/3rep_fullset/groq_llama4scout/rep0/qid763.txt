## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a quadratic curve that passes through the points (-2,0) and (1,0) on the x-axis and asks for the equation of this curve. The points given indicate that the roots of the quadratic equation are -2 and 1.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Form of the Equation
A quadratic equation with roots \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) can be written in the form \(y = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\), where \(a\) is a constant. Given the roots are -2 and 1, the equation can be written as \(y = a(x + 2)(x - 1)\).

## 3: Evaluating the Options
- Option A: \(y = (x - 2)(x + 1)\) suggests roots of 2 and -1, which do not match the given points.
- Option B: \(y = (x - 1)(x + 2)\) suggests roots of 1 and -2, matching the given points. This is a possible correct answer if \(a = 1\).
- Option C: \(y = x^2 - 2\) does not have roots of -2 and 1.
- Option D: \(y = x^2 - 2x\) can be rewritten as \(y = x(x - 2)\), suggesting roots of 0 and 2, which do not match.

## 4: Considering Student Errors
Students might make errors due to misinterpreting the roots or not fully utilizing the given information. However, this question is quite straightforward because the roots directly correspond to one of the answer choices without needing further algebraic manipulation.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle to understand the relationship between the roots and the equation. They might randomly select an option or choose one that seems familiar. Option B seems correct based on the roots, but without algebraic confidence, they might choose incorrectly. Prediction: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and might recognize the form of a quadratic equation. They are likely to choose B as it directly matches the given roots. Prediction: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students are confident in their algebraic manipulations and understand the implications of the roots. They will easily identify B as the correct answer. Prediction: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the algebraic form but might also consider the coefficient \(a\). However, given \(a=1\) fits, they will also choose B. Prediction: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%.

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
