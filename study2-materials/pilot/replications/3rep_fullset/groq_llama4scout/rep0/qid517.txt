To predict how students at different ability levels would respond to this question, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question requires students to add the cost of a sandwich (£3.25) and a tea (£1.55) to find out how much money Sunita will need. This seems straightforward, but let's consider what could go wrong.

1. **Basic Calculation Error**: Students might struggle with adding the numbers correctly, especially if they are not confident in their basic addition skills or if they make errors with decimal points.

2. **Misconception or Distraction**: The menu provides several other items, but the question specifically asks for a sandwich and a tea. A potential misconception could involve adding or substituting other items, but given the question's clarity, this seems less likely unless students are not paying attention.

3. **Calculation**: The actual calculation required is £3.25 + £1.55. 

Let's do the calculation: 
£3.25 + £1.55 = £4.80

Given this, the correct answer is B: £4.80.

Now, predicting the responses based on ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the addition, especially with decimals. They might not even attempt the calculation or could get it wrong due to a lack of understanding of decimal addition.
  - A=20% (possibly due to incorrect calculation or adding incorrectly)
  - B=40% (correct calculation, but let's assume they might not all get it right)
  - C=15% (might be a result of incorrect addition or confusion)
  - D=25% (another possible incorrect calculation)

- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of basic math operations but might still make simple errors.
  - A=10%
  - B=70% (most should get the correct calculation)
  - C=10%
  - D=10%

- **Proficient**: These students are confident in their math skills and should find this easy.
  - A=5%
  - B=90% (most will get it right)
  - C=3%
  - D=2%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very confident and have a deep understanding of math concepts. They should all get it right.
  - A=0%
  - B=98% (almost all will get it right)
  - C=1%
  - D=1%

Therefore, in the exact format requested:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
