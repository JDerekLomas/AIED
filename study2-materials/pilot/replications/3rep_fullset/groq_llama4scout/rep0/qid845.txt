To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question presents a triangle with angles \(90\degree, 50\degree, 40\degree\). 

1. **Understanding what makes a triangle right-angled:** A triangle is right-angled if one of its angles is \(90\degree\). 
2. **Understanding what makes a triangle isosceles:** A triangle is isosceles if two of its sides are equal in length, which also means two of its angles are equal.

Given the angles \(90\degree, 50\degree, 40\degree\), 
- The triangle is clearly right-angled because it has a \(90\degree\) angle, making Tom correct.
- The triangle is not isosceles because all its angles are different (\(90\degree, 50\degree, 40\degree\)), making Katie incorrect.

## Analysis by Ability Level

### below_basic
At this level, students may struggle with basic geometry concepts or have difficulties in identifying types of triangles based on angles. However, the presence of a \(90\degree\) angle is a clear indicator of a right-angled triangle.
- A (Only Tom): likely to be high because students can see the \(90\degree\) angle.
- B (Both Tom and Katie): unlikely because students might not deeply analyze the angles for isosceles condition.
- C (Only Katie): unlikely because there's no indication the triangle is isosceles.
- D (Neither are correct): unlikely because Tom is correct.

Predicted: below_basic: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%

### basic
Students at this level have a solid grasp of basic geometric shapes and can apply straightforward concepts.
- They will easily identify the \(90\degree\) angle, confirming Tom.
- They might not mistakenly identify the triangle as isosceles due to the clear difference in angles.

Predicted: basic: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%

### proficient
These students have a deeper understanding and can analyze geometric properties more critically.
- They will confirm Tom's statement easily.
- They will also correctly identify that Katie is wrong due to the angles not supporting an isosceles triangle.

Predicted: proficient: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%

### advanced
Students at this level have a very strong grasp of geometry and can apply complex concepts.
- They will not only confirm Tom's statement but also understand why Katie's statement is incorrect without hesitation.

Predicted: advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
basic: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
