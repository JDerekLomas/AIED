To predict how students at different ability levels might respond to this question, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question asks to convert \( \frac{1}{8} \) th of an hour into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, \( \frac{1}{8} \) th of an hour is \( \frac{1}{8} \times 60 = 7.5 \) minutes.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception might involve incorrectly converting fractions of an hour to minutes, possibly due to confusion with the number of minutes in an hour or misunderstanding the fraction. However, this question seems straightforward as it directly involves a simple calculation.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 7.5 \) minutes, which is the correct answer.
- Option B: \( 8 \) minutes, a plausible but incorrect answer if a student makes a calculation error.
- Option C: \( 0.8 \) minutes, seems highly unlikely as it suggests less than a minute, which might appeal to a student who misunderstands the conversion significantly.
- Option D: \( 12.5 \) minutes, another incorrect answer that could result from a miscalculation.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions and fractions. They might choose \( 8 \) (B) due to a simple miscalculation or \( 0.8 \) (C) if they misunderstand the concept of fractions of an hour significantly. \( 12.5 \) (D) could also be a choice if they incorrectly calculate \( \frac{1}{8} \times 60 \). The correct answer, \( 7.5 \) (A), might be challenging for them to arrive at. So, below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a better grasp of fractions and conversions. They might still make simple calculation errors, leading to choices like \( 8 \) (B) or \( 12.5 \) (D), but they are more likely to choose the correct answer \( 7.5 \) (A). So, basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
- **Proficient:** These students are expected to handle such conversions with ease. The correct answer \( 7.5 \) (A) should be their primary choice, with minimal selection of incorrect options. So, proficient: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only answer correctly but also do so with confidence. The correct answer \( 7.5 \) (A) is expected to be chosen by virtually all of them. So, advanced: A=95% B=3% C=0% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=0% D=2%
