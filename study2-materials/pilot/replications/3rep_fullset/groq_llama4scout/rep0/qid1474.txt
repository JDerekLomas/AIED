To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to the order of operations.

The question involves a simple arithmetic expression: \(6 - 3 + 2\). The order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) dictates that operations should be performed from left to right when the operations are of equal precedence (like addition and subtraction). Therefore, the expression should be evaluated as \(6 - 3 = 3\), then \(3 + 2 = 5\).

Tom suggests rewriting it as \((6 - 3) + 2\), which explicitly follows the order of operations and evaluates to \(5\). Katie suggests leaving it as \(6 - 3 + 2\), which also evaluates to \(5\) when done correctly.

The misconception often tested in such questions revolves around the incorrect application of the order of operations or assuming that adding brackets changes the value in a way that wasn't intended. However, in this specific case, both Tom and Katie's methods yield the correct result of \(5\), but the question essentially tests the understanding that both representations are valid and lead to the same result due to the associative property of addition.

## Step 1: Understand the Task
The task requires predicting the percentage of students at different ability levels (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) in response to whether Tom, Katie, both, or neither is correct about making \(6 - 3 + 2 = 5\).

## 2: Analyze Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of the order of operations. They might incorrectly evaluate expressions or misunderstand how brackets affect calculations. Given that both methods actually work, but might not fully grasp the implications, they might choose **A=20%**, **B=20%**, **C=30%**, **D=30%** due to confusion.

- **Basic:** Basic level students are expected to understand and apply basic arithmetic operations and have a foundational understanding of the order of operations. They should see that both Tom and Katie are correct but might be more inclined to mistakenly believe only one method is valid due to limited exposure to multiple solutions. So, **A=15%**, **B=15%**, **C=60%**, **D=10%**.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students have a solid grasp of arithmetic and the order of operations. They understand that both expressions equal \(5\) and recognize that the use of brackets can clarify but does not change the outcome. Hence, **A=5%**, **B=5%**, **C=85%**, **D=5%**.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the arithmetic but can also reason about properties of operations (like associativity). They would easily see that both Tom and Katie are correct and that the expressions are equivalent. Therefore, **A=0%**, **B=0%**, **C=95%**, **D=5%**.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
