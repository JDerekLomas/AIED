To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls it presents.

The question involves interpreting a graph that shows the amount of potatoes consumed by a restaurant over the course of a week. The task is to determine how many potatoes were consumed on Friday. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task requires the student to read the value from the graph for Friday. This is a straightforward task that doesn't necessarily test mathematical skills beyond reading a graph.

## 2: Identifying Potential Pitfalls
One potential pitfall could be if students misread the graph or are unable to interpret it correctly. However, the question does not present a complex graph; it seems to be a simple line graph or bar graph that should be easy to read.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
Given the lack of specific details about the graph's appearance, let's assume it's a standard graph where each day of the week is marked on the x-axis and the amount of potatoes consumed in kilograms is on the y-axis.

## 4: Considering Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with reading the graph, especially if they're not familiar with interpreting graphical data. They might choose an option based on misunderstanding the scale or misreading the day.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to read a simple graph. They might make errors if the graph is complex or if they misinterpret the question.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily read the graph and choose the correct answer without much trouble.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only read the graph correctly but also understand the context and possibly perform additional calculations if required. However, this question seems straightforward.

## 5: Making Predictions
Without the actual graph, we must consider general tendencies:
- The question seems straightforward, suggesting that most students, even at the basic level, should be able to get it right if they can read a graph.
- A common misconception could involve misunderstanding the scale or the data point for Friday, but without specific numbers, we assume the graph clearly shows a specific amount for Friday.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Given that the question appears straightforward and does not inherently suggest a complex mathematical operation or a common misconception that would be triggered by the information given:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (guessing), B=30% (another guess), C=30% (could be a plausible number), D=20% (another guess). Let's say A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** A=5% (unlikely to choose an obviously wrong answer if they can read the graph), B=10% (might confuse with another day), C=80% (likely correct if they read it right), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Proficient:** A=0% (should know better), B=0% (unlikely mistake), C=95% (highly likely to be correct), D=5% (very unlikely).
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=100% (should easily and accurately read the graph), D=0%.

The best answer is C.
