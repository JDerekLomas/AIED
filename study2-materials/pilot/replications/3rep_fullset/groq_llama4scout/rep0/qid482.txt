To approach this question, let's break down the concept and the specific details of the question that might influence student responses.

The question tests the understanding of vertically opposite angles, which are angles that are opposite each other when two lines intersect. A key property of vertically opposite angles is that they are equal in measure.

Given the diagram:
- The angle labeled \( p \) is formed by the intersection of three lines, with \( p \) being one of the angles around the top-left intersection point.
- The task is to identify which angle is vertically opposite to angle \( p \).

## Step 1: Understanding Vertically Opposite Angles
Vertically opposite angles are formed when two lines intersect, creating four angles around the point of intersection. The angles directly opposite each other are vertically opposite angles and are equal.

## 2: Analyzing the Diagram
In the given diagram, there are two intersection points: one near the top-left and another near the bottom-right. The angle \( p \) is near the top-left intersection. 

## 3: Identifying the Vertically Opposite Angle to \( p \)
At the intersection where \( p \) is located, the angles are labeled A, C, B, and \( p \) clockwise from the top-left. The vertically opposite angle to \( p \) would be the one directly across from it, which is angle C.

## 4: Considering Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric concepts. They might confuse the position of angles or not fully understand the concept of vertically opposite angles. However, given the clear labeling and the simplicity of the concept being tested, most might still be able to identify the correct answer based on visual cues, but with a higher chance of error. So, A=10%, B=10%, C=60%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of geometry. They should be able to identify vertically opposite angles with some confidence. The correct answer, C, should be chosen by a significant majority. So, A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of geometric principles, including the properties of angles formed by intersecting lines. They should easily identify angle C as the vertically opposite angle to \( p \). So, A=2%, B=2%, C=90%, D=6%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them to more complex situations. They would have no trouble identifying angle C. So, A=1%, B=1%, C=95%, D=3%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
