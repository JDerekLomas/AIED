## Step 1: Understand the question and the graph provided
The question provides a graph of the equation \(y = 0.5x - 2\) and asks for the solution to the equation \(0.5x - 2 = 1\) based on the graph. The graph shows a straight line with a y-intercept at \((0, -2)\) and an x-intercept at \((4, 0)\).

## 2: Solve the equation \(0.5x - 2 = 1\) algebraically
To solve \(0.5x - 2 = 1\), we add 2 to both sides, resulting in \(0.5x = 3\). Then, we divide both sides by 0.5, which gives \(x = 6\).

## 3: Analyze the graph for the solution
The graph provided shows that when \(y = 1\), we need to find the corresponding \(x\) value. Since the equation \(0.5x - 2 = 1\) is solved to \(x = 6\), we are looking for the point on the graph where \(y = 1\).

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception might involve misreading the graph or not understanding how to solve the equation \(0.5x - 2 = 1\). However, given that the graph's intercepts are provided and the equation is straightforward to solve algebraically, the challenge might lie in accurately reading the graph or applying algebraic methods.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with both algebraic manipulation and reading the graph accurately. They might incorrectly solve the equation or misinterpret the graph, leading to random or incorrect answers. Given the simplicity of the algebraic solution (\(x = 6\)), and assuming they can't accurately read the graph, they might be tempted by options that seem plausible or are visually appealing on the graph.

- **Basic**: Students at this level can perform basic algebraic operations but might make careless mistakes. They should be able to solve \(0.5x - 2 = 1\) to get \(x = 6\), but might not accurately assess the graph.

- **Proficient**: These students can accurately solve the equation and understand the graph. They should easily find \(x = 6\) as the solution.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only solve the equation correctly but also understand the graphical representation. They should quickly identify \(x = 6\) as the correct answer without any issues.

## 6: Assign percentages based on ability levels and question difficulty
Given that the algebraic solution is straightforward (\(x = 6\)), and assuming most students can solve the equation or understand the graph:
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (as they might guess or partially understand), B=20%, C=10%, D=10% (misinterpreting the graph or solving incorrectly).
- **Basic**: A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5% (most solve it correctly but a few might misinterpret).
- **Proficient**: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1% (accurately solve and understand).
- **Advanced**: A=99%, B=0.5%, C=0.25%, D=0.25% (very high accuracy).

The best answer is A.
