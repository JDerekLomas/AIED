To approach this question, let's analyze the content and potential pitfalls.

The expression given is \( \frac{t^{2}-1}{t+1} \). This can be simplified using the difference of squares formula, where \( t^{2} - 1 = (t + 1)(t - 1) \). Therefore, the expression simplifies to \( \frac{(t + 1)(t - 1)}{t + 1} \). For \( t \neq -1 \), this simplifies further to \( t - 1 \), because the \( (t + 1) \) in the numerator and denominator cancel out.

## Step 1: Identifying the Correct Simplification
The correct simplification of the given expression is \( t - 1 \), which corresponds to option C.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not canceling out the \( (t + 1) \) terms or mistakenly thinking the expression cannot be simplified. However, the expression is designed to test the recognition of the difference of squares and the cancellation of common factors.

## 3: Considering Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations, including factoring and canceling common factors. They might not recognize the difference of squares or might not see that \( t+1 \) can be canceled out, potentially leading them to choose "Does not simplify" (D) or incorrectly simplify.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a basic understanding of algebraic expressions and possibly the difference of squares. However, they might still make errors in canceling terms or might not fully understand the conditions under which terms can be canceled (e.g., \( t \neq -1 \)).
- **Proficient:** Proficient students should easily recognize the difference of squares and correctly cancel out the \( t+1 \) terms, leading them to choose option C (\( t-1 \)).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students should not only correctly simplify the expression but also understand the domain restrictions (\( t \neq -1 \)).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given the nature of the question:
- **Below Basic:** A=10% (some might mistakenly simplify to \( t \)), B=15% (might see it as \( t+1 \) due to confusion), C=40% (correct but struggling), D=35% (not recognizing simplification).
- **Basic:** A=5% (less likely to confuse with \( t \)), B=10% (less likely but possible confusion with \( t+1 \)), C=70% (most should get it right), D=15% (some uncertainty).
- **Proficient:** A=2% (rare mistake), B=5% (unlikely), C=90% (most get it right), D=3% (very few).
- **Advanced:** A=1% (very rare), B=2% (unlikely), C=95% (almost all get it right), D=2% (rare).

## 5: Final Predictions
- **below_basic:** A=10% B=15% C=40% D=35%
- **basic:** A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
- **proficient:** A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
- **advanced:** A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=40% D=35%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
