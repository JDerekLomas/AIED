To approach this question, let's consider the concept of rotational symmetry and how students at different ability levels might respond.

Rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a shape can be rotated by a certain angle and still look the same. A rotational symmetry order of 2 means the shape looks the same after a 180-degree rotation.

## Step 1: Understanding the Shapes
- A rectangle has rotational symmetry of order 2 because it looks the same after a 180-degree rotation.
- A square has rotational symmetry of order 4 because it looks the same after 90, 180, 270, and 360-degree rotations.
- A trapezium typically does not have rotational symmetry of order 2, except for isosceles trapeziums which might be considered but are not standard examples.
- A hexagon can have rotational symmetry of order 6 (for a regular hexagon) but not necessarily order 2 exclusively.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
Students might confuse rotational symmetry with line symmetry or misunderstand what rotational symmetry order means. The rectangle (A) clearly has rotational symmetry order 2. The square (B) has a higher order, which might confuse some students into thinking it also has order 2, but it's more than that. The trapezium (C) and hexagon (D) are less likely to be chosen because their symmetries are either not order 2 or more complex.

## 3: Ability Level Predictions
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students may struggle with basic geometry concepts. They might not fully understand rotational symmetry, but they're more likely to guess based on familiar shapes. So, A=40% (rectangle seems plausible), B=30% (square seems likely due to its familiar symmetry), C=15% (trapezium might be guessed), D=15% (hexagon seems less likely).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic shapes and might start to understand symmetry. A=60% (rectangle is straightforward), B=25% (some might still think square only), C=5% (trapezium unlikely), D=10% (hexagon less likely).
- **Proficient**: These students understand symmetry well. A=80% (rectangle is clear), B=15% (some might mistakenly think square), C=3% (trapezium unlikely), D=2% (hexagon unlikely).
- **Advanced**: At this level, students have a deep understanding of geometry. A=95% (clearly rectangle), B=4% (unlikely to choose square), C=1% (trapezium), D=0% (hexagon).

## 4: Assigning Percentages
Given these considerations, let's assign the percentages:

- **below_basic**: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
- **basic**: A=60% B=25% C=5% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%

The best answer is A.
