## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to understand how to calculate the number of degrees representing a specific category (comedy) in a pie chart. The pie chart data is based on the number of teachers for each film genre: Comedy (9), Romance (4), and Action (7).

## 2: Identifying the Correct Formula
To find the number of degrees for comedy in the pie chart, students need to know that a pie chart represents data using 360 degrees. The fraction of the circle that comedy represents is the number of comedy teachers divided by the total number of teachers, multiplied by 360 degrees. The total number of teachers is 9 (comedy) + 4 (romance) + 7 (action) = 20.

## 3: Calculating the Correct Option
The correct calculation for the number of degrees representing comedy is \( \frac{9}{20} \times 360 \). This can be simplified to \( \frac{9}{9+4+7} \times 360 \) or \( \frac{9}{20} \times 360 \), which matches option D: \( \frac{9}{9+7+4} \times 360 \).

## 4: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \( 360 \div 9 \), suggests dividing the total degrees in a circle by the number of comedy teachers, which does not account for the total number of teachers or the proportion of comedy teachers.

## 5: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( 360 \div 13 \times 9 \), seems to incorrectly calculate the total number of teachers as 13 (which is incorrect since 9+4+7=20) and then applies it. This option might appeal to students who misunderstand how to calculate proportions.

## 6: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( 360 \div 9+4+7 \times 4 \), is incorrect because it misinterprets the order of operations and does not correctly calculate the fraction of the circle that comedy represents.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding proportions and calculations. They might choose A because it's simple and doesn't require understanding of total proportions, or B because it looks like it involves all numbers but is miscalculated. Option D seems complex. A=40%, B=30%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand basic proportions but could still make errors. They might see that option A is incorrect because it doesn't account for all teachers, and option C is clearly wrong due to incorrect operation order. They might be tempted by B due to its simplicity but incorrectness. A=10%, B=40%, C=10%, D=40%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand proportions and are likely to choose D, recognizing it's the only option that correctly calculates the proportion of comedy teachers. A=5%, B=10%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will easily identify D as correct and might not even consider the other options seriously. A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 8: Formatting the Answer
Given the analysis, the predicted percentages for each ability level are:
- below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
- basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
- proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
