To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the task and common misconceptions related to simplifying expressions involving square roots and multiplication.

The task requires simplifying \(9 \times \sqrt{3}\). A key concept here is that \(9 = 3^2\), and \(\sqrt{3}\) can be thought of as \(3^{1/2}\). When multiplying, we add the exponents if the bases are the same. However, directly applying this rule doesn't immediately simplify the expression without understanding that \(9\) can be expressed as \(3^2\), but the focus is on whether \(9\sqrt{3}\) can be simplified further into a form involving a square root.

## Step 1: Understanding the Expression
The expression \(9 \times \sqrt{3}\) can be seen as \(3^2 \times 3^{1/2}\), which simplifies to \(3^{2 + 1/2} = 3^{5/2}\). This can also be expressed as \(3^2 \times 3^{1/2} = 9 \times \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{9^2 \times 3} = \sqrt{81 \times 3} = \sqrt{243}\). However, none of the options directly match this form, suggesting a need to evaluate each option.

## 2: Evaluating Options
- Option A: \(\sqrt{12}\). This is \( \sqrt{4 \times 3} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3} \), not equivalent to \(9\sqrt{3}\).
- Option B: \(\sqrt{27}\). This is \( \sqrt{9 \times 3} = \sqrt{9} \times \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3} \), not equivalent to \(9\sqrt{3}\).
- Option C: \(9\sqrt{3}\). This directly matches the given expression without any simplification.
- Option D: Cannot be simplified. The expression \(9\sqrt{3}\) is already in a simplified form because \(9\) and \(\sqrt{3}\) do not share a common factor that can be simplified further in the context of radicals.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and properties of radicals. They might incorrectly simplify or not simplify at all. Option C (\(9\sqrt{3}\)) seems straightforward, but they might mistakenly choose A or B due to confusion. Option D might seem plausible if they misunderstand simplification.
- **Basic**: At this level, students understand basic properties of radicals but might not always apply them correctly. They are likely to recognize \(9\sqrt{3}\) as simplified but might be tempted by A or B if they mistakenly try to apply radical properties.
- **Proficient**: Students here should easily recognize that \(9\sqrt{3}\) is already in its simplest form. They should select Option C or D, with a good understanding that it cannot be simplified into a form without radicals (choosing D) or recognizing it as already simplified (choosing C).
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to not only recognize \(9\sqrt{3}\) as already simplified but also understand the radical properties well. They should accurately choose Option C, understanding that \(9\sqrt{3}\) is a simplified form and not equivalent to the other options.

## 4: Making Predictions
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (confusion with radical properties), B=20% (similar confusion), C=40% (direct recognition), D=20% (misunderstanding of simplification).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=10%, C=60%, D=20%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
