To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( (-6)-(-8)= \), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with subtracting negative numbers.

The question requires the application of the rule that subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding a positive number. So, \( (-6)-(-8) \) can be rewritten as \( -6 + 8 \), which equals \( 2 \). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception when dealing with negative numbers is that students might forget to change the sign of the second number when subtracting a negative, or they might get confused with the signs and end up with an incorrect operation (e.g., addition instead of subtraction or vice versa).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 14 \) - This would be incorrect as it suggests adding the two numbers instead of applying the correct operation.
- Option B: \( -14 \) - This option suggests a misunderstanding of the operations with negative numbers, possibly incorrectly subtracting or adding.
- Option C: \( 2 \) - This is the correct answer, achieved by correctly applying the rule \( (-6) - (-8) = -6 + 8 = 2 \).
- Option D: \( -2 \) - This option might result from a confusion in operations or signs.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with the concept of negative numbers and operations involving them. They may incorrectly add or subtract without considering the signs properly. 
  - A: High chance of selecting an incorrect operation (possibly around 40-50%).
  - B: Similarly, high chance of another incorrect operation (around 30-40%).
  - C: Lower chance of getting it right due to fundamental struggles (around 10-20%).
  - D: Some chance, depending on their specific misunderstanding (around 5-20%).

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to carelessness or not fully grasping the concept of subtracting a negative.
  - A: Less likely to choose this (around 20-30%).
  - B: Also less likely (around 15-25%).
  - C: Higher chance of getting it right as they understand basic operations (around 40-50%).
  - D: Some might still get confused (around 10-20%).

- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make careless mistakes.
  - A: Unlikely to choose this (around 5-10%).
  - B: Unlikely (around 5-10%).
  - C: High chance of getting it right (around 70-80%).
  - D: Low chance (around 5-10%).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts well but can also apply them accurately in various contexts.
  - A: Very unlikely (around 0-5%).
  - B: Very unlikely (around 0-5%).
  - C: Almost certain to get it right (around 90-95%).
  - D: Highly unlikely (around 0-5%).

## 4: Assigning Percentages
Based on the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=45% B=35% C=15% D=5%
- **Basic**: A=25% B=20% C=50% D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=45% B=35% C=15% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
