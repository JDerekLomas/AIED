To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "Find \( 20 \% \) of \( 80 \)", let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for \( 20 \% \) of \( 80 \). This is a straightforward percentage calculation: \( 20 \% \) of \( 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve misunderstanding what \( 20 \% \) means or incorrectly calculating the percentage of a number. For example, some students might mistakenly calculate \( 20 \% \) as \( 20 \) out of \( 100 \) without converting it to a decimal or fraction properly, or they might add or subtract percentages incorrectly.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( 8 \)
- B: \( 20 \)
- C: \( 96 \)
- D: \( 16 \)

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic percentage calculations. They might confuse \( 20 \% \) with \( 20 \) or miscalculate \( 20 \% \) of \( 80 \) as \( 20 \) (thinking \( 20 \% \) means \( 20 \) out of \( 80 \), not converting to a decimal). So, \( B = 20 \) could be a plausible incorrect answer. \( A = 8 \) might come from a miscalculation or confusion. \( C = 96 \) seems unlikely but could result from a miscalculation like \( 80 + 20\% \) of \( 80 \) or similar. \( D = 16 \) is the correct answer.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a basic understanding of percentages. They are likely to get \( 20 \% \) of \( 80 = 16 \) correct but might make simple errors. So, \( D = 16 \) should be high, with some chance of \( A \) or \( B \) due to simple miscalculations.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily calculate \( 20 \% \) of \( 80 \) as \( 16 \), so \( D = 16 \) should be very high, with minimal errors.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only calculate \( 20 \% \) of \( 80 \) correctly but also understand the context. Errors should be minimal, so \( D = 16 \) should be near \( 100 \% \).

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (miscalculation), B=40% (confusing percentage with actual value), C=10% (unlikely but possible error), D=20% (correct but challenging).
- **Basic**: A=10% (simple error), B=5% (less likely error), C=5% (unlikely error), D=80% (correct calculation).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (minor error), B=2% (unlikely), C=2% (unlikely), D=91% (correct).
- **Advanced**: A=1% (rare error), B=1% (rare), C=1% (very unlikely), D=97% (correct).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=2% D=91%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%
