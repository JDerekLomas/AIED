## Step 1: Understand the quadratic formula and its components
The quadratic formula is given by \(h = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where for the equation \(5h^2 - 3h - 2 = 0\), \(a = 5\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = -2\).

## 2: Identify the components of the quadratic formula in the given equation
To use the quadratic formula, we need to calculate \(b^2\) and \(4ac\). Here, \(b^2 = (-3)^2 = 9\) and \(4ac = 4 \times 5 \times (-2) = -40\).

## 3: Calculate the determinant (\(b^2 - 4ac\))
The determinant, \(\triangle\), is \(9 - (-40) = 9 + 40 = 49\).

## 4: Understand what the question asks
The question asks what should replace the triangle in the formula \(? \pm \sqrt{\triangle - ?}\) to match the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula can be rewritten as \(h = \frac{-b}{2a} \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), implying that \(\triangle = b^2 - 4ac\) and the \(?\) outside the square root is \(\frac{b}{2a}\) but considering the structure given, it seems to focus on the \(\pm \sqrt{\triangle - ?}\) part directly.

## 5: Relate the given equation to the standard form of the quadratic formula
Given \(5h^2 - 3h - 2 = 0\), \(a = 5\), \(b = -3\), \(c = -2\). The term under the square root in the quadratic formula is \(b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4(5)(-2) = 9 + 40 = 49\). The formula provided in the question seems to be \(h = ? \pm \sqrt{\triangle - ?}\), but to match the quadratic formula structure, we consider \(\triangle = 49\) and we are looking for what fits \(? \pm \sqrt{49 - ?}\).

## 6: Calculate the value to replace the first and second triangle
The quadratic formula gives \(h = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot (-2)}}{2 \cdot 5}\) which simplifies to \(h = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{10}\). This implies that to get \(\sqrt{49}\) directly under the square root, we need the equation to reflect \(\sqrt{49}\) directly, suggesting \(\triangle = 49\). For the equation to balance, \(? = \frac{3}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{3}{10}\) for the \(+\) and \(-\) part outside the square root in a standard quadratic formula application, but the question specifically asks for the value that would make \(\triangle - ? = 49 - ? = 0\) or fit into the equation provided, implying a direct substitution might not require calculating \(?\) from \(\frac{b}{2a}\) but understanding what fits the provided structure.

## 7: Realize the specific request of the question
The question seems to misunderstand or misrepresent the quadratic formula's application. Normally, \(\triangle = b^2 - 4ac = 49\), and there's no subtraction of another value from \(\triangle\) in the standard formula. The values provided (A, B, C, D) seem to relate to \(4ac\) or parts of the formula rather than a straightforward \(?\).

## 8: Identify the error and correct understanding
The correct calculation directly from the quadratic formula gives \(\triangle = 49\), and the part \(4ac = -40\), implying the equation under the square root is \(49\). If considering \(? \pm \sqrt{\triangle - ?}\), to directly solve or match given answers, note that the actual calculation of roots isn't requested but what fits the equation given.

## 9: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with the quadratic formula and its components. They might not accurately calculate \(b^2 - 4ac\) or understand its role, potentially guessing or misinterpreting the formula. (A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%)
- **Basic**: Students understand the quadratic formula but might make calculation errors. They could correctly identify \(\triangle = 49\) but struggle with what \(-4ac\) or similar means. (A=15% B=15% C=35% D=35%)
- **Proficient**: Students are familiar with the quadratic formula and can apply it. They know \(\triangle = 49\) and might catch that \(
