To approach this question, let's analyze the objects and measurements provided and consider the typical understanding and potential misconceptions students might have regarding volume measurements.

## Step 1: Understanding the Objects and Measurements
The objects given are an egg cup, a cereal box, a chest of drawers, and a piggy bank. The measurements provided are \(87 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\), \(1013 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\), \(4172 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\), and \(197,177 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\). 

## 2: Associating Objects with Likely Volumes
- An egg cup is typically small, used to hold an egg, so its volume should be relatively small.
- A cereal box is larger than an egg cup but still relatively small compared to furniture.
- A chest of drawers and a piggy bank are larger objects, but the chest of drawers is significantly larger than a piggy bank.

## 3: Analyzing Measurements
- \(87 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\) seems very small, potentially suitable for a very small object.
- \(1013 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\) is slightly over 1 liter, which could reasonably fit a cereal box or a small to medium-sized piggy bank.
- \(4172 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\) is about 4 liters, which could fit a larger container like a chest of drawers but seems large for a standard cereal box or piggy bank.
- \(197,177 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\) is approximately 197 liters, which is extremely large for all these objects except perhaps a very large chest of drawers.

## 4: Matching Objects to Measurements
Given the sizes:
- The egg cup would likely have the smallest volume.
- The cereal box and piggy bank would have volumes in the middle range.
- The chest of drawers would likely have the largest volume.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand volume well or might confuse units. They could mistakenly choose larger volumes for smaller objects. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 30\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 20\%\)
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might make simple errors. They are more likely to choose \(A = 60\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 10\%\)
- **Proficient**: These students understand volume and can apply it to real objects. They are likely to choose \(A = 80\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 4\%\), \(D = 1\%\)
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong understanding and can reason abstractly. They would likely choose \(A = 95\%\), \(B = 4\%\), \(C = 1\%\), \(D = 0\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
