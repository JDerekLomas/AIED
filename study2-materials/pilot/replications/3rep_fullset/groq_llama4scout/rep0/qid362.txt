To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about finding the gradient of a line given its equation \(4x + 3y = 5\), let's consider the process of solving such a problem and common misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task requires rearranging the equation of a line into the slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the gradient (or slope) of the line. The given equation is \(4x + 3y = 5\). To find the gradient, we rearrange this equation to solve for \(y\).

## 2: Solving for \(y\)
Rearranging the equation:
\[3y = -4x + 5\]
\[y = -\frac{4}{3}x + \frac{5}{3}\]
Thus, the gradient (\(m\)) of the line is \(-\frac{4}{3}\).

## 3: Identifying Common Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the coefficients or incorrectly rearranging the equation. For instance, some students might incorrectly identify the gradient as the coefficient of \(x\) without considering the sign or the denominator when rearranging.

## 4: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \(-4\), which might be chosen by students who incorrectly identify the gradient without rearranging the equation properly.
- Option B: \(4\), likely a distractor for those who misinterpret the signs or coefficients.
- Option C: \(-\frac{4}{3}\), the correct gradient.
- Option D: \(\frac{4}{3}\), possibly chosen by students who forget the negative sign in front of \(\frac{4}{3}\).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulation and could easily choose incorrect options due to lack of understanding of the equation form. They might choose A or B due to misinterpretation or not attempting to rearrange the equation.
  - A: 30% (incorrect but plausible if they ignore the \(y\) term)
  - B: 20% (completely incorrect)
  - C: 20% (some might get it right through luck or partial understanding)
  - D: 30% (another incorrect option)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in algebraic manipulation.
  - A: 15%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 60% (most understand the concept but may still make calculation errors)
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and should easily identify the correct gradient.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 85%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are not only proficient but also have a deeper understanding, making errors less likely.
  - A: 2%
  - B: 2%
  - C: 95%
  - D: 1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
