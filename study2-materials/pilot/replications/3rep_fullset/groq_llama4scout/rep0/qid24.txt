## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential misconception
The question requires students to solve for \(\bigstar\) in the equation \(\bigstar \times 4 = 108\). This involves dividing 108 by 4 to find \(\bigstar\). A common misconception might involve incorrect division or not fully understanding the inverse operation of multiplication, which is division.

## 2: Calculate the correct answer
To find \(\bigstar\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4: \(\bigstar = 108 \div 4 = 27\).

## 3: Analyze the answer choices
The correct answer is \(27\). Let's look at the other options:
- A: \(112\) (Incorrect, as \(112 \times 4 = 448\), not 108)
- B: \(27\) (Correct, as \(27 \times 4 = 108\))
- C: \(432\) (Incorrect, as \(432 \times 4 = 1728\), not 108)
- D: \(104\) (Incorrect, as \(104 \times 4 = 416\), not 108)

## 4: Consider student ability levels and potential errors
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic division facts or misunderstand the operation. They might choose options that seem plausible or are close to a correct calculation but are actually incorrect. Option C (\(432\)) could seem plausible if a student mistakenly thinks \(108 \times 4 = 432\), but actually, it's the other way around. Option A (\(112\)) might be chosen if a student incorrectly adds or estimates. Given the simplicity of the division, most might still guess or choose randomly, but some might pick \(27\) if they recall basic division facts.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a better grasp of basic multiplication and division facts. They might still make errors due to rushing or miscalculation but are more likely to choose \(27\).
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to solve the equation correctly and choose \(27\). Mistakes might come from calculation errors, but given the straightforward nature of \(108 \div 4\), errors should be minimal.
- **Advanced**: This group should easily solve the equation and choose \(27\). They are less likely to make errors due to a strong understanding of mathematical operations.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (random guess), B=20% (getting it right by chance or basic recall), C=30% (misconception or error), D=20% (another guess).
- **Basic**: A=10% (error), B=80% (correct), C=5% (rare error), D=5% (rare guess).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (minor error), B=90% (correct), C=3% (rare error), D=2% (rare guess).
- **Advanced**: A=2% (rare mistake), B=95% (correct), C=2% (rare mistake), D=1% (extremely rare guess).

## 6: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
