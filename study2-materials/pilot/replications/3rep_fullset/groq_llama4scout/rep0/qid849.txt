To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the content and the potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question requires converting a Roman numeral (CCXLIX) into an Arabic numeral. The Roman numeral CCXLIX can be broken down as follows: CC = 200, XL = 40, IX = 9. So, CCXLIX = 200 + 40 + 9 = 249.

## Step 1: Understanding the Roman Numeral
The Roman numeral CCXLIX is converted by understanding the values: C=100, X=10, L=50, I=1. The correct conversion involves combining these values: CC (2*100) = 200, XL (50-10) = 40, and IX (10-1) = 9.

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors
A common error might be in the conversion of XL to 60 (instead of 40) because students might incorrectly add X and L (10+50 = 60), and another error could be in understanding the IX as 11 (instead of 9) because students might add I and X (1+10 = 11). However, given the straightforward nature of this specific question and the clear values of the Roman numerals provided, such errors might be less prevalent.

## 3: Analyzing Option Attractiveness
- Option A: 271. This could potentially be chosen by someone who incorrectly adds or misinterprets the Roman numerals significantly.
- Option B: 269. This might appeal to someone who mistakenly calculates the value, possibly misinterpreting IX as 19 (10+9) but correctly handles the rest (200 + 40 + 19 = 259, indicating a confusion; actually, adding 10 to get 259).
- Option C: 249. This is the correct answer based on the breakdown (200 + 40 + 9).
- Option D: 259. This could be chosen by a student who adds 10 instead of 9 (200 + 40 + 10 - 1 = 249, but mistakenly goes for 259).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not have a strong grasp of Roman numerals. Given the options, they might guess or use a trial and error method, but let's assume they have some basic familiarity. They might lean towards incorrect options due to a lack of understanding. A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding. They might make simple errors. C seems likely for those who understand Roman numerals well enough. A=20%, B=15%, C=55%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand Roman numerals well. A few might make careless mistakes. A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are very familiar with Roman numerals and less likely to make errors. A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The best answer is C. 

Given the predictions:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
