## Step 1: Understand the question and the concept being tested
The question tests the concept of finding the coordinates of a point that divides a line segment into equal parts, specifically when the points are equally spaced. This involves understanding of coordinate geometry, particularly the midpoint formula or the section formula.

## 2: Identify the coordinates of points P and R
The coordinates of \( P \) and \( R \) are given as \( P(-4, -10) \) and \( R(2, 7) \).

## 3: Determine the coordinates of point Q
Since \( P, Q, \) and \( R \) are equally spaced, \( Q \) is the midpoint of \( P \) and \( R \). The midpoint \( Q \) between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) can be found using the formula:
\[ Q = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right) \]
Substituting the given values:
\[ Q = \left( \frac{-4 + 2}{2}, \frac{-10 + 7}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{-2}{2}, \frac{-3}{2} \right) = \left( -1, -1.5 \right) \]

## 4: Analyze the difficulty of the question
This question requires the application of the midpoint formula. The numbers are simple enough that calculations can be easily done mentally or with minimal effort, reducing the chance for arithmetic errors.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with applying the formula or with the arithmetic. They might not even attempt to use the midpoint formula or could make significant calculation errors. Option D seems less likely to be chosen by those who don't understand the concept since it requires a more nuanced calculation.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to apply the midpoint formula but might make minor arithmetic errors. They are more likely to choose an option close to the correct calculation but not exactly right.
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately apply the midpoint formula and select the correct answer, \( (-1, -1.5) \).
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concept but are also less likely to make errors in calculation. They will definitely choose the correct option.

## 6: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the correct answer is \( (-1, -1.5) \), which corresponds to option D:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30% (struggle with the concept and calculations)
- **Basic**: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55% (can apply the concept but might make some errors)
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85% (accurately apply the concept)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100% (no errors in understanding or calculation)

The best answer is D. 

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
