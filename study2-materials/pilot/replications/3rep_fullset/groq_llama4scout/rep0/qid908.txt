## Step 1: Understand the question and the graph
The question provides a graph of \(y = 1 - 0.4x\) and asks students to use the graph to solve the equation \(1 - 0.4x = 0\). This essentially means finding the x-intercept of the graph, where \(y = 0\).

## 2: Solve the equation algebraically for reference
To solve \(1 - 0.4x = 0\), we rearrange the equation:
\(1 - 0.4x = 0\)
\(-0.4x = -1\)
\(x = \frac{-1}{-0.4}\)
\(x = 2.5\)

## 3: Analyze the difficulty and potential misconceptions
The question tests the students' ability to interpret a graph and solve an equation. A common misconception might involve incorrectly reading the graph or misunderstanding how to find the solution to the equation graphically. However, given that the equation is straightforward and the graph is provided, the main task is to identify the x-intercept.

## 4: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with reading the graph or understanding the equation. They might not accurately solve the equation or correctly interpret the graph. There's a higher chance they could choose an incorrect option due to misinterpretation.
- **Basic:** Students here might be able to follow the equation but could make simple errors in reading the graph or solving the equation.
- **Proficient:** These students should be able to accurately solve the equation and interpret the graph, leading to the correct answer.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are likely to not only solve the equation correctly but also understand the graphical representation, making them less prone to errors.

## 5: Predict student responses
Given the graph and equation, the correct answer is \(x = 2.5\), which corresponds to option A.

- **Below Basic:** Might choose B, C, or D due to confusion (A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%)
- **Basic:** Should lean towards A but might have some errors (A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%)
- **Proficient:** Should mostly choose A with minimal errors (A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%)
- **Advanced:** Will likely choose A with very few errors (A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%)

## 6: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
