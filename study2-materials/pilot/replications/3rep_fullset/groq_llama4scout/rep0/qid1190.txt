To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given equation \(-5 = p + 10\), let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

## Step 1: Understanding the Equation
The equation given is \(-5 = p + 10\). To solve for \(p\), one needs to isolate \(p\) on one side of the equation. This involves subtracting 10 from both sides, yielding \(p = -5 - 10 = -15\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception in solving linear equations involves incorrect handling of operations on both sides of the equation. For this specific question, students might struggle with subtracting a positive number or adding a negative number. However, the structure of this equation is straightforward.

## 3: Analyzing Option A (\(p = 5\))
Option A suggests \(p = 5\), which would be incorrect because it implies adding 10 to \(p\) results in \(-5\), suggesting \(p\) is positive, which does not align with the correct solution.

## 4: Analyzing Option B (\(p = -5\))
Option B, \(p = -5\), might seem plausible to some students who incorrectly think that \(-5 + 10 = -5\), not recognizing that \(p\) needs to be adjusted to satisfy the equation.

## 5: Analyzing Option C (\(p = -15\))
Option C, \(p = -15\), is the correct solution, as \(-15 + 10 = -5\), satisfying the equation.

## 6: Analyzing Option D (\(p = 15\))
Option D, \(p = 15\), is clearly incorrect because \(15 + 10 = 25\), not \(-5\).

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand how to solve for \(p\) or might make careless mistakes. They could be tempted by options that seem simpler or more intuitive, such as B. 
  - A: 20% (guessing)
  - B: 30% (misunderstanding)
  - C: 30% (correct, but might not understand why)
  - D: 20% (incorrect, possibly guessing)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might struggle with negative numbers or double negatives.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 20%
  - C: 60% (correct)
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient:** These students understand linear equations well and should solve the equation correctly most of the time.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 85%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are confident and accurate in solving equations.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 0%
  - C: 95%
  - D: 5% (possibly a guess or careless error)

The best answer is C. 

Below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
Basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
