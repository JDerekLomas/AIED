To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or ease of solving it.

The question asks students to add two fractions: \( \frac{3}{10} + \frac{5}{10} \) and then to write the answer in its simplest form.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The fractions given have the same denominator, which makes the addition straightforward: \( \frac{3}{10} + \frac{5}{10} = \frac{3+5}{10} = \frac{8}{10} \).

## 2: Simplifying the Answer
The fraction \( \frac{8}{10} \) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2, resulting in \( \frac{4}{5} \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( \frac{8}{20} \) is equivalent to \( \frac{4}{10} \) or \( \frac{2}{5} \), not a simplified form of \( \frac{8}{10} \).
- Option B: \( \frac{8}{10} \) is the result of the addition but not in its simplest form.
- Option C: \( \frac{4}{5} \) is the correct answer in its simplest form.
- Option D: \( \frac{4}{10} \) simplifies to \( \frac{2}{5} \), not the correct simplified form of \( \frac{8}{10} \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with adding fractions and simplifying. They might not simplify \( \frac{8}{10} \) correctly or might add the fractions incorrectly. Option A (\( \frac{8}{20} \)) could appeal due to a misapplication of operations or not simplifying. Option B (\( \frac{8}{10} \)) might be chosen by those who can add but not simplify. Option C (\( \frac{4}{5} \)) requires both addition and simplification skills. Option D (\( \frac{4}{10} \)) might be seen as a partially correct step. Predicted percentages: A=30% (incorrect addition/simplification), B=40% (correct addition but not simplification), C=20% (correct), D=10%.
- **Basic:** Students here should be able to add fractions with the same denominator and might simplify. They might choose B more frequently than below basic but still struggle with full simplification. Predicted percentages: A=10%, B=60%, C=25%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily add and simplify fractions. They are likely to choose C. Predicted percentages: A=0%, B=10%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** These students will certainly choose C, as they have a strong grasp of fraction operations and simplification. Predicted percentages: A=0%, B=0%, C=100%, D=0%.

## 5: Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
- **basic:** A=10% B=60% C=25% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=0% B=10% C=85% D=5%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=10% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
