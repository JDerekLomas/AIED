## Step 1: Understand the question and the circle equation
The question provides a circle on a set of axes, with the circle passing through the points (4,0), (0, -4), (-4,0), and (0,4). The general equation of a circle centered at the origin is \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

## 2: Determine the radius of the circle
Given that the circle passes through (4,0), we can substitute these coordinates into the general equation to find \(r\). So, \(4^2 + 0^2 = r^2\), which simplifies to \(16 = r^2\). Therefore, the equation of the circle is \(x^2 + y^2 = 16\).

## 3: Analyze the answer choices
- A: \(x^2 + y^2 = 16\)
- B: \(x^2 + y^2 = \sqrt{4}\) which simplifies to \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\)
- C: \(x^2 + y^2 = 8\)
- D: \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\)

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception might involve confusing the radius with the diameter or not understanding how to derive the equation of a circle from given points. However, given the points provided, it's straightforward to see that the radius is 4 units because the circle intersects the axes at (4,0), (-4,0), (0,4), and (0,-4).

## 5: Evaluate student performance at different ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and geometry concepts. They might not recognize the form of the circle equation or correctly calculate \(r^2\). Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, with B, C, or D being plausible guesses.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might make careless errors. They should recognize the circle's equation but could miscalculate \(r^2\).
- **Proficient:** These students understand the circle equation and can apply it correctly. They should easily identify the correct answer.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the equation but can also derive it from given conditions. They are less likely to make errors.

## 6: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the simplicity of deriving the correct answer (A) from the given points, and assuming most students can recognize the circle passes through (4,0) and thus has a radius of 4:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (recognizing the equation form), B=30% (guessing small numbers), C=20% (thinking radius might be \(\sqrt{8}\)), D=30% (thinking radius is 2).
- **Basic:** A=60% (correct calculation), B=10% (misconception), C=15% (miscalculation), D=15% (simple error).
- **Proficient:** A=90% (accurate calculation), B=2% (rare mistake), C=3% (occasional slip), D=5% (minor error).
- **Advanced:** A=98% (very confident), B=0.5% (extremely rare error), C=0.5% (very rare mistake), D=1% (almost never).

## 7: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0.5% C=0.5% D=1%
