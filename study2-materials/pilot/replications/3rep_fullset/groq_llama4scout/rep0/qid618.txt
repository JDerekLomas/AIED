To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \frac{13}{40} \) written as a percentage, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question requires converting a fraction to a percentage. The fraction \( \frac{13}{40} \) can be converted by dividing 13 by 40 and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

## Step 1: Calculate the correct answer
To find the correct answer, we calculate \( \frac{13}{40} \times 100 \). This equals \( 32.5\% \).

## 2: Identify potential misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not converting the fraction to a decimal or percentage correctly, or misunderstanding the relationship between fractions, decimals, and percentages.

## 3: Analyze option A
Option A is \( 32.5\% \), which is the correct conversion of \( \frac{13}{40} \) to a percentage.

## 4: Analyze option B
Option B is \( 13\% \), which might be chosen by students who simply take the numerator as a percentage of the denominator without performing the calculation (e.g., \( 13\% \) of \( 40\% \) or a similar incorrect operation).

## 5: Analyze option C
Option C is \( 26\% \), which could result from an incorrect calculation or estimation.

## 6: Analyze option D
Option D is \( 52\% \), which seems too high and might result from a gross miscalculation.

## 7: Consider student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions and are likely to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding or miscalculation. They might choose B, C, or D due to not knowing how to convert a fraction to a percentage.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make errors in calculation or conversion. They are more likely to choose A but could be tempted by B or C if they misunderstand the conversion process.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are expected to have a solid grasp of converting fractions to percentages. They are likely to choose A but might occasionally choose B, C, or D if they make a calculation error.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are unlikely to make errors in such a straightforward conversion and are expected to choose A.

## 8: Estimate percentages based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might get it by chance or have a rough estimation), B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=20%, C=15%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=85%, B=10%, C=4%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=1%, D=0%.

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
