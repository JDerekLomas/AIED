To approach this question, let's analyze the content and potential misconceptions:

1. **Understanding Units of Area**: A unit of area is a measure of the size of a two-dimensional space. Common units include square metres (m²), square centimetres (cm²), and square millimetres (mm²).

2. **Misconceptions**:
   - A common misconception is that the unit of measurement for area can be a single linear unit (like centimetres or millimetres) rather than a squared unit. This misconception arises because students might confuse the concept of area with length.

3. **Specific Statements**:
   - **Tom says centimetres is a unit of area**: This statement is incorrect because centimetres measure length, not area. The correct unit for area involving centimetres would be square centimetres (cm²).
   - **Katie says mm² is a unit of area**: This statement is correct because mm² (square millimetres) indeed measures area.

4. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: Only Tom**: Incorrect because Tom is wrong.
   - **B: Only Katie**: Correct because Katie is right, and Tom is wrong.
   - **C: Both Tom and Katie**: Incorrect because Tom is wrong.
   - **D: Neither is correct**: Incorrect because Katie is correct.

5. **Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels**:
   - **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of area and units. They might think Tom is correct because they associate "centimetres" with measurements, not realizing the need for "square" for area. They might also not recognize mm² as a unit of area. So, they could lean towards **A=40%** (thinking Tom could be right about centimetres being a unit of area), **B=20%** (only Katie), **C=10%** (both), and **D=30%** (neither).
   - **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still be prone to simple mistakes. They likely know mm² is a unit of area but might be confused about Tom's statement. Expect **A=20%**, **B=60%**, **C=10%**, and **D=10%**.
   - **Proficient**: These students understand area units well. They should easily identify Katie as correct and Tom as incorrect. So, **A=5%**, **B=80%**, **C=5%**, and **D=10%**.
   - **Advanced**: Advanced students have a deep understanding and can apply concepts accurately. They will definitely choose **B=90%**, with small percentages for incorrect options: **A=2%**, **C=2%**, and **D=6%**.

Given the above analysis, the predictions would be:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=2% D=6%
