## Step 1: Understand the process of completing the square
To complete the square for the expression \(2g^{2} - 6g - 5\), we first factor out the coefficient of \(g^{2}\), which is 2, from the terms involving \(g^{2}\) and \(g\). This gives us \(2(g^{2} - 3g) - 5\).

## 2: Add and subtract the appropriate value to complete the square
The formula to complete the square for \(x^{2} + bx\) is \((x + \frac{b}{2})^{2} - (\frac{b}{2})^{2}\). Applying this to \(g^{2} - 3g\), we get \((g - \frac{3}{2})^{2} - (\frac{3}{2})^{2}\). So, \(g^{2} - 3g = (g - \frac{3}{2})^{2} - \frac{9}{4}\).

## 3: Substitute back into the original expression
Substituting back into \(2(g^{2} - 3g) - 5\), we get \(2((g - \frac{3}{2})^{2} - \frac{9}{4}) - 5 = 2(g - \frac{3}{2})^{2} - \frac{9}{2} - 5 = 2(g - \frac{3}{2})^{2} - \frac{9}{2} - \frac{10}{2} = 2(g - \frac{3}{2})^{2} - \frac{19}{2}\).

## 4: Compare with the given equation
The given equation is \(2g^{2} - 6g - 5 \equiv 2(g \bigstar)^{2} \triangle\). From our completion of squares, \(2(g - \frac{3}{2})^{2} - \frac{19}{2}\) implies that \(\bigstar = -\frac{3}{2}\) or \(-1.5\).

## 5: Analyze the answer choices
- A: \(\bigstar = -6\)
- B: \(\bigstar = -3\)
- C: \(\bigstar = -1.5\)
- D: \(\bigstar = -\sqrt{6}\)

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand completing the square or might make significant calculation errors. They might choose A or B due to misunderstanding the process or not completing the square correctly.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might struggle with the application. They might recognize the need to complete the square but could get the value wrong, possibly choosing B or C if they recall the formula but misapply it.
- **Proficient**: These students understand completing the square well and should easily identify \(\bigstar = -1.5\), thus choosing C.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the process but can also apply it efficiently. They will definitely choose C.

## 7: Estimate percentages for each option
Given the correct answer is C (\(\bigstar = -1.5\)), and considering common misconceptions and the clarity of the question:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (completely off), B=30% (partially off but in the realm of the numbers given), C=20% (some understanding), D=10% (unlikely).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=30%, C=40%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 8: Format the response
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
