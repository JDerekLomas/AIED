To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the size of each interior angle in a regular hexagon, let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions.

The formula to calculate the size of each interior angle in a regular polygon is: \( \text{Interior Angle} = \frac{(n-2) \times 180}{n} \), where \( n \) is the number of sides of the polygon. For a hexagon, \( n = 6 \), so the calculation is: \( \frac{(6-2) \times 180}{6} = \frac{4 \times 180}{6} = \frac{720}{6} = 120^{\circ} \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the size of each interior angle in a regular hexagon. This is a straightforward application of the formula for interior angles of regular polygons.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the formula or not applying it correctly, or perhaps recalling properties of specific polygons (like equilateral triangles, squares, or pentagons) and incorrectly applying them.

## 3: Analyzing Option A (\( 60^{\circ} \))
This is the interior angle of an equilateral triangle, not a hexagon. Students might choose this if they confuse a hexagon with a triangle or mistakenly apply a formula incorrectly.

## 4: Analyzing Option B (\( 135^{\circ} \))
This could be related to the interior angle of a regular octagon (\( \frac{(8-2) \times 180}{8} = 135^{\circ} \)), suggesting a possible confusion with another polygon.

## 5: Analyzing Option C (\( 120^{\circ} \))
This is the correct answer, as calculated. Students with a good understanding of the formula and its application should choose this.

## 6: Analyzing Option D (\( 160^{\circ} \))
This does not correspond to a simple or common polygon's interior angle and might be chosen by students who have a significant misunderstanding or miscalculation.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** These students might struggle with the formula or not understand the concept of regular polygons. They might guess or choose based on limited knowledge. \( A = 20\% \) (guessing or recalling triangles), \( B = 15\% \) (random or related to another polygon), \( C = 40\% \) (some recall or simple calculation), \( D = 25\% \) (completely off or guessing).
- **Basic:** Students at this level have some understanding but might make calculation errors or confuse with other polygons. \( A = 10\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 60\% \), \( D = 10\% \).
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept and can apply the formula but might still make occasional errors. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 80\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are confident and accurate in their calculations. \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 0\% \), \( C = 95\% \), \( D = 5\% \) ( potentially a very careless mistake).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
