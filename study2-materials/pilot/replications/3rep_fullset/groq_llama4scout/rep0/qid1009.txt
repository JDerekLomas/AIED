To approach this question, let's first analyze the algebraic process involved and then consider the potential misconceptions or pitfalls that students at different ability levels might encounter.

The equation given is \(\frac{3x}{2} + 1 = 1.6\). 

## Step 1: Solve the equation to verify Tom's and Katie's steps.
To verify Tom's suggestion: \(\frac{3x}{2} = 0.6\), we subtract 1 from both sides of the equation \(\frac{3x}{2} + 1 = 1.6\), which yields \(\frac{3x}{2} = 0.6\). This matches Tom's step, so Tom is correct.

## 2: Verify Katie's step.
Katie suggests \(3x + 2 = 2.12\). To see if this is a correct step from the original equation, we need to manipulate the original equation: \(\frac{3x}{2} + 1 = 1.6\). Multiplying every term by 2 to clear the fraction gives \(3x + 2 = 3.2\), not \(2.12\). So, Katie is incorrect.

## 3: Analyze potential student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations, including subtracting 1 from both sides or multiplying by 2. They might not even attempt to verify Tom's or Katie's steps correctly. Given the simplicity of Tom's step and the obvious error in Katie's, but considering potential calculation errors or misunderstandings, we might expect:
  - A significant portion to incorrectly validate Katie's step or invalidate Tom's.
  - **Prediction:** below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They should easily verify Tom's step. Katie's step involves a multiplication by 2, which they should manage, but might calculate incorrectly.
  - **Prediction:** basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%

- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with algebra and should easily spot Tom's correct step and Katie's mistake. They understand the operations involved.
  - **Prediction:** proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong algebraic foundation and should quickly and accurately assess both steps. They are less likely to make mistakes in their calculations.
  - **Prediction:** advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
