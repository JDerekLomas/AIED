## Step 1: Understand the question and the graph provided
The question asks for the gradient (\(m\)) of a line that passes through the points (0,0) and (6,-4) when written in the form \(y = mx + c\). Given that the line passes through (0,0), \(c = 0\), simplifying the equation to \(y = mx\).

## 2: Calculate the gradient of the line
The gradient \(m\) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\). Using the points (0,0) and (6,-4), we find \(m = \frac{-4 - 0}{6 - 0} = \frac{-4}{6} = -\frac{2}{3}\).

## 3: Analyze the options and potential student errors
The correct answer is \(D: -\frac{2}{3}\). To predict student responses, consider common errors:
- Miscalculating the gradient.
- Incorrectly applying the formula.
- Misinterpreting the graph.

## 4: Consider student ability levels and potential errors
- **Below Basic**: Students may struggle with basic calculations or not understand the concept of gradient. They might incorrectly calculate \(m\) or choose an option without calculation.
- **Basic**: Students understand the concept but may make calculation errors or confuse the formula.
- **Proficient**: Students are likely to calculate \(m\) correctly but might be distracted by incorrect options.
- **Advanced**: Students are expected to not only calculate \(m\) correctly but also understand the implications of the line's characteristics.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: May randomly select or make significant calculation errors. Option A (\( -\frac{1}{2} \)) or B (\( \frac{1}{2} \)) might be chosen due to simple miscalculations or lack of understanding. \(A=40\%\), \(B=30\%\), \(C=15\%\), \(D=15\%\).
- **Basic**: More likely to attempt calculation, still prone to errors. \(A=20\%\), \(B=25\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=45\%\).
- **Proficient**: Accurately calculate \(m\), slight chance of error. \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=85\%\).
- **Advanced**: Understand and accurately apply concepts. \(A=0\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=0\%\), \(D=100\%\).

## 6: Adjust predictions based on the question's specifics
Given the straightforward nature of calculating \(m\) and the clear graph, even lower ability students are less likely to make severe errors compared to questions with more complex calculations or trickier graphs.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=10% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
