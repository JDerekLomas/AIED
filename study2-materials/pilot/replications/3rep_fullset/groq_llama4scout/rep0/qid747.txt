## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks students to determine in which region the graph of \( y=(x+4)(x-2) \) would belong based on two conditions: having a line of symmetry at \( x = 3 \) and having a \( y \)-intercept that is negative. The equation given is \( y = (x + 4)(x - 2) \).

## 2: Analyze the equation
To analyze the equation \( y = (x + 4)(x - 2) \), let's first expand it: \( y = x^2 + 2x - 8 \). This is a quadratic equation in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -8 \).

## 3: Determine the line of symmetry
The line of symmetry for a quadratic equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Substituting \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \) into this formula gives \( x = -\frac{2}{2*1} = -1 \). This means the graph of \( y = (x + 4)(x - 2) \) has a line of symmetry at \( x = -1 \), not \( x = 3 \).

## 4: Determine the y-intercept
The \( y \)-intercept occurs when \( x = 0 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the equation \( y = (x + 4)(x - 2) \) gives \( y = (0 + 4)(0 - 2) = 4 * -2 = -8 \). Therefore, the \( y \)-intercept is \( -8 \), which is negative.

## 5: Evaluate the regions
- The set on the left is 'Line of symmetry at \( x = 3 \)'.
- The set on the right is ' \( y \)-intercept is negative'.
Given that the line of symmetry is at \( x = -1 \) (not \( x = 3 \)) and the \( y \)-intercept is negative, the graph belongs to the region where the \( y \)-intercept is negative but not where the line of symmetry is at \( x = 3 \).

## 6: Predict student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with both finding the line of symmetry and calculating the \( y \)-intercept. They might incorrectly assume the line of symmetry is \( x = 3 \) or struggle to calculate the \( y \)-intercept correctly. A=30% (incorrectly thinking it has a line of symmetry at \( x = 3 \) but not a negative \( y \)-intercept), B=10% (guessing), C=40% (correctly identifying the negative \( y \)-intercept but possibly misinterpreting the line of symmetry), D=20% (not fitting either criterion correctly, possibly due to calculation errors).
- **Basic**: Students here should have a better grasp of quadratic equations. They might still make errors in calculations or interpretations. A=20% (misunderstanding line of symmetry), B=15% (some might see both conditions partially), C=55% (most should correctly identify the negative \( y \)-intercept and not the line of symmetry at \( x = 3 \)), D=10% (correctly ruling out both).
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately find the line of symmetry and \( y \)-intercept. A=5% (likely to mistakenly think it fits the line of symmetry condition), B=5% (unlikely to think it fits both), C=80% (correctly identifying it has a negative \( y \)-intercept but not a line of symmetry at \( x = 3 \)), D=10% (ruling out both conditions correctly).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should have a strong understanding and make minimal errors. A=0% (unlikely to mistakenly place in A), B=0% (know it doesn't fit both), C=90% (accurately place based on correct calculations), D=10% (perhaps questioning or ensuring their understanding).

## 7: Assign percentages
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%
- **basic**: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A
