To approach this question, let's break it down into steps and consider the potential pitfalls and understanding required at different levels of mathematical ability.

## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question presents an equation: \( -5 \times 4 = -12 - ? \). The task is to solve for \( ? \).

## 2: Solve the Equation
First, calculate \( -5 \times 4 = -20 \). So, the equation becomes \( -20 = -12 - ? \).

## 3: Solve for \( ? \)
To isolate \( ? \), rearrange the equation: \( ? = -12 + 20 \), which simplifies to \( ? = 8 \).

## 4: Analyze Potential Errors
- A common misconception could be incorrectly handling the negative signs or the operation. However, the calculation \( -5 \times 4 \) is straightforward and less likely to cause errors for those with basic multiplication skills.
- Another potential issue could be rearranging the equation, but given the numbers are small and manageable, this should also be relatively straightforward.

## 5: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication and handling negative numbers. They might incorrectly calculate \( -5 \times 4 \) as \( -20 \) but then struggle to solve for \( ? \) due to not fully understanding how to rearrange the equation or incorrectly adding/subtracting.

## 6: Predict Student Responses
Given the straightforward nature of the calculations:
- The correct answer is \( B = 8 \).
- **Below Basic**: Might get confused and choose incorrectly, potentially A=20% (guessing or misunderstanding the calculation), B=40% (actually solving it correctly despite being below basic), C=20% (misinterpreting the operation), D=20% (another incorrect interpretation).
- **Basic**: Should be able to handle the multiplication and equation solving, so B=80%, with some potentially making simple arithmetic errors, leading to A=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: Will easily solve the equation, so B=95%, with minor errors possibly leading to A=1%, C=2%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: Will also easily solve it with virtually no errors, so B=99%, with A=0.5%, C=0.25%, D=0.25%.

## 7: Final Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- **basic**: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
- **advanced**: A=0.5% B=99% C=0.25% D=0.25%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
advanced: A=0.5% B=99% C=0.25% D=0.25%
