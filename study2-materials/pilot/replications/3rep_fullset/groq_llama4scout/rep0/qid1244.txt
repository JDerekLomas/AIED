To approach this question, let's analyze the components and the requirements for completing the net of a triangular prism.

A triangular prism has 5 faces: 2 triangular faces (the top and the bottom) and 3 rectangular faces (the sides). The given net already includes 1 equilateral triangle and 1 rectangle, with one side of the rectangle attached to one side of the triangle. 

To complete the net, we need to add:
- 1 more triangular face (to make 2 triangular faces in total),
- And 3 more rectangular faces (since one rectangular face is already provided, we need 3 additional ones to make 4 rectangular faces in total, but correctly understood, we only need 2 more rectangles because a prism has 3 rectangular faces and one is already drawn).

However, my initial analysis misinterprets the straightforward need: 
- We have 1 triangle and 1 rectangle. 
- A triangular prism needs 2 triangles and 3 rectangles.
- So, we are missing 1 triangle and 2 rectangles.

Thus, the correct answer is A: \( 1 \) triangle and \( 2 \) rectangles.

Let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

### below_basic:
At this level, students might struggle with understanding the basic geometry and visualizing the completion of the prism. They might not correctly count the faces or might misunderstand the shapes needed.
- A: \( 20\% \) (some might get it right through luck or basic understanding)
- B: \( 40\% \) (misunderstanding the composition of a triangular prism)
- C: \( 20\% \) (thinking only rectangles are needed)
- D: \( 20\% \) (overestimating the number of rectangles needed)

### basic:
Students at this level have a basic understanding but might make simple errors in counting or identifying shapes.
- A: \( 60\% \) (most would understand the basic requirement)
- B: \( 25\% \) (still some confusion about the types of faces)
- C: \( 10\% \) (underestimating the role of triangles)
- D: \( 5\% \) (less likely to overestimate significantly)

### proficient:
These students have a solid understanding of geometric shapes and their properties.
- A: \( 85\% \) (clear understanding of the prism's faces)
- B: \( 10\% \) (less likely to make significant errors)
- C: \( 3\% \) (unlikely to neglect the triangular faces)
- D: \( 2\% \) (rarely would they miscalculate this)

### advanced:
Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply their knowledge accurately.
- A: \( 95\% \) (virtually all would get it right)
- B: \( 3\% \) (minimal chance of error)
- C: \( 1\% \) (unlikely to make a significant mistake)
- D: \( 1\% \) (equally unlikely to miscalculate)

So, the response in the requested format is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
