To approach this question, let's analyze the potential difficulties and misconceptions associated with the order of operations, particularly focusing on the specific expression \(8 - 7 \div 6^{3}\).

The order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction), dictates that calculations should be performed in a specific order. For the given expression, the correct order is:
1. Calculate the index (\(6^{3}\))
2. Perform the division (\(7 \div 6^{3}\))
3. Finally, perform the subtraction (\(8 - \text{result of division}\))

Given this, the correct answer is A) \(6^{3}\), as indices are evaluated before division and subtraction according to BIDMAS.

Let's consider the potential responses based on student ability levels:

### Below Basic
Students at this level might not fully understand or remember the order of operations. They might mistakenly think that operations should be performed from left to right or might not recognize \(6^{3}\) as needing to be calculated first.
- A) \(6^{3}\): 40% (some might recall that indices need to be calculated first)
- B) \(7 \div 6\): 30% (perform division before dealing with the exponent)
- C) \(8 - 7\): 20% (thinking operations go from left to right)
- D) It doesn't matter: you get the same answer: 10% (not understanding the significance of order)

### Basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of BIDMAS but might make simple mistakes, especially if the numbers or context seem to suggest an alternative order.
- A) \(6^{3}\): 60% (understanding indices come first)
- B) \(7 \div 6\): 25% (still some confusion about priority)
- C) \(8 - 7\): 10% (less likely to ignore BIDMAS completely)
- D) It doesn't matter: you get the same answer: 5% (better understanding that order matters)

### Proficient
These students are more likely to apply BIDMAS correctly and understand why \(6^{3}\) must be calculated first.
- A) \(6^{3}\): 80% (strong understanding of BIDMAS)
- B) \(7 \div 6\): 15% (some residual confusion)
- C) \(8 - 7\): 3% (unlikely to ignore BIDMAS)
- D) It doesn't matter: you get the same answer: 2% (recognize the importance of order)

### Advanced
Students at this level not only understand BIDMAS but are also less likely to fall into common traps.
- A) \(6^{3}\): 95% (very confident in applying BIDMAS correctly)
- B) \(7 \div 6\): 4% (minor confusion)
- C) \(8 - 7\): 1% (very unlikely to suggest this)
- D) It doesn't matter: you get the same answer: 0% (clear understanding of order impact)

Thus, the predicted percentages are:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
