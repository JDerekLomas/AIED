To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \(18 \div 2 + 2 \times 2 =\), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or areas of difficulty students might have.

The question requires the application of the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Substitution) in the UK. For the given expression \(18 \div 2 + 2 \times 2\), following BIDMAS:

1. Division and Multiplication are performed before Addition, so we do \(18 \div 2 = 9\) and \(2 \times 2 = 4\).
2. Then, we add the results: \(9 + 4 = 13\).

Thus, the correct answer is B) \(13\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception is to perform operations from left to right without adhering to the order of operations. For this question, that would mean calculating \(18 \div 2 = 9\), then \(9 + 2 = 11\), and finally \(11 \times 2 = 22\), which corresponds to option C) \(22\). Another mistake could be not following the order correctly, leading to \(18 \div (2+2) = 18 \div 4 = 4.5\), but this isn't directly relevant as none of the options match this calculation directly.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A) \(3\): This seems unlikely as a straightforward calculation error doesn't lead directly to this result.
- Option B) \(13\): This is the correct answer following BIDMAS.
- Option C) \(22\): This could result from a miscalculation or incorrect application of operations (as described).
- Option D) \(12\): This could be a result of \(18 \div 2 = 9\) and then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), but incorrectly calculating or combining these, such as \(9 + 2 + 1 = 12\) or similar incorrect steps.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand or apply BIDMAS correctly. They might calculate from left to right or make basic errors. Option C) \(22\) seems plausible for a miscalculation. Let's assume A=\(5\%\), B=\(20\%\), C=\(60\%\), D=\(15\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic operations but may struggle with order of operations. They might still make errors. Let's assume A=\(2\%\), B=\(70\%\), C=\(20\%\), D=\(8\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand and can apply BIDMAS. Errors should be minimal. Let's assume A=\(1\%\), B=\(95\%\), C=\(3\%\), D=\(1\%\).
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand BIDMAS but can also apply it in complex contexts. Errors should be very rare. Let's assume A=\(0\%\), B=\(99\%\), C=\(1\%\), D=\(0\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
basic: A=2% B=70% C=20% D=8%
proficient: A=1% B=95% C=3% D=1%
advanced: A=0% B=99% C=1% D=0%
