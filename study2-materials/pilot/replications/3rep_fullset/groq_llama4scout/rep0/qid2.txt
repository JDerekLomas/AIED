## Step 1: Understand the question and the concepts involved
The question involves understanding the concept of range in statistics, which is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset. Tom and Katie make statements about how the range of plant heights would change under different conditions: Tom says cutting all plants in half wouldn't change the range, and Katie says if all plants grew by \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \) each, the range wouldn't change.

## 2: Analyze Tom's statement
If all plants are cut in half, their heights would be: \( 12 \mathrm{~cm}, 8.5 \mathrm{~cm}, 21 \mathrm{~cm}, 13 \mathrm{~cm}, 6.5 \mathrm{~cm} \). The original range is \( 42 \mathrm{~cm} - 13 \mathrm{~cm} = 29 \mathrm{~cm} \), and the new range would be \( 21 \mathrm{~cm} - 6.5 \mathrm{~cm} = 14.5 \mathrm{~cm} \). Thus, Tom is incorrect because cutting all plants in half would change the range.

## 3: Analyze Katie's statement
If all plants grow by \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \) each, their heights would be: \( 27 \mathrm{~cm}, 20 \mathrm{~cm}, 45 \mathrm{~cm}, 29 \mathrm{~cm}, 16 \mathrm{~cm} \). The original range is \( 42 \mathrm{~cm} - 13 \mathrm{~cm} = 29 \mathrm{~cm} \), and the new range would be \( 45 \mathrm{~cm} - 16 \mathrm{~cm} = 29 \mathrm{~cm} \). Therefore, Katie is correct because adding \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \) to each plant's height does not change the range.

## 4: Consider student understanding and potential misconceptions
Students might struggle with understanding how transformations affect the range. A common misconception is that any uniform transformation (like adding or subtracting the same value to all data points, or multiplying/dividing all by the same factor) does or does not affect the range. Specifically, multiplying or dividing all values by a constant changes the range by that same factor, but adding or subtracting a constant to all values does not change the range.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of range or how transformations affect it. They might incorrectly agree with Tom (A) because they misunderstand the effect of halving, or they might not understand Katie's statement either. However, given the straightforward nature of Katie's statement, more might agree with Katie (B) or not know (D). The distribution could be A=30%, B=20%, C=10%, D=40%, but this needs adjustment based on typical misconceptions.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still fall into common traps. They are likely to realize Katie is correct but might be confused about Tom's statement. So, B=40%, D=30%, A=15%, C=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and should see that Katie is correct and Tom is incorrect. Thus, they are likely to choose B=60%, D=30%, with A and C being less likely.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately. They will easily see Katie's correctness and Tom's incorrectness, likely choosing B=80%, D=15%, with A and C being minimal.

## 6: Adjust predictions based on the question's specifics
Given that Katie's statement is clearly correct and Tom's is clearly incorrect based on the definitions of range and how linear transformations affect it, we expect:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
- **Basic**: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
