To approach this question, let's first understand what the function machine is doing and then predict the student responses based on their likely familiarity with function machines and algebraic operations.

The function machine takes an input, performs two operations in sequence, and then produces an output. The operations are:
1. Multiply by 2 (✕2)
2. Subtract 1 (−1)

Given the input is 8, we calculate the output step by step:
1. \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
2. \(16 - 1 = 15\)

So, the correct output is \(15\), which corresponds to option A.

Let's analyze the potential for errors:
- The question requires applying two operations in the correct order, which is a fundamental concept in algebra and functions.
- Multiplying by 2 and then subtracting 1 are common operations, but the sequence and accuracy of calculation are key.

## Predicted Student Responses:

### below_basic:
At this level, students might struggle with following the sequence of operations or with basic arithmetic. They might incorrectly apply the operations or make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- A (correct answer) might be chosen by students who can follow the sequence correctly and perform the arithmetic accurately, but given the struggles at this level, let's assume \(60\%\).
- B (\(5\)) could result from a miscalculation or incorrect operation sequence; assume \(20\%\).
- C (\(14\)) might result from subtracting 1 before multiplying by 2 or another incorrect sequence; assume \(10\%\).
- D (\(4.5\)) seems less likely as it might involve a division or incorrect handling of operations; assume \(10\%\).

So, below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%

### basic:
Students at this level have a better grasp of basic arithmetic and sequence of operations but might still make some errors.
- A (correct) should be higher than in the below_basic group; let's assume \(80\%\).
- B (\(5\)) could still be a plausible incorrect answer due to miscalculation; assume \(10\%\).
- C (\(14\)) might be chosen by students who misunderstand the sequence; assume \(5\%\).
- D (\(4.5\)) seems unlikely; assume \(5\%\).

So, basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%

### proficient:
At this level, students are generally comfortable with algebraic expressions and sequences of operations.
- A (correct) should be very high; assume \(95\%\).
- B (\(5\)), C (\(14\)), and D (\(4.5\)) are less likely; assume \(1.67\%\) each.

So, proficient: A=95% B=1.67% C=1.67% D=1.67%

### advanced:
Students at this level have a strong grasp of mathematics and are less likely to make errors in basic algebraic manipulations.
- A (correct) should be extremely high; assume \(99\%\).
- B (\(5\)), C (\(14\)), and D (\(4.5\)) are very unlikely; assume \(0.33\%\) each.

So, advanced: A=99% B=0.33% C=0.33% D=0.33%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=1.67% C=1.67% D=1.67%
advanced: A=99% B=0.33% C=0.33% D=0.33%
