## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests
The question tests the factorization of a quadratic expression and the understanding of how the coefficients of the linear terms and the constant term relate to the factors. The expression given is \(m^{2}+3m-28\), and it needs to be factorized into the form \((m+a)(m+b)\). The relationship between the coefficients in the original expression and the factors is that \(a + b = 3\) and \(ab = -28\).

## 2: Identify the correct answer
To factorize \(m^{2}+3m-28\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \(-28\) and add up to \(3\). These numbers are \(7\) and \(-4\) because \(7 - 4 = 3\) and \(7 \times -4 = -28\). So, \(a = 7\) and \(b = -4\) (or vice versa), which means \(a \times b = 7 \times -4 = -28\).

## 3: Analyze the difficulty of the question
The question seems straightforward for students who are familiar with factorizing quadratic expressions. However, the actual challenge lies in recognizing that \(a \times b\) equals the constant term in the quadratic expression (with a change of sign), which is a fundamental property.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with factorization and understanding the relationship between coefficients. They might not correctly identify \(a\) and \(b\) or might confuse the operations. Expect a spread across options but with a higher chance of incorrect answers.
- **Basic:** Students here should have a grasp of basic factorization but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to recognize the need to find \(a\) and \(b\) but might not accurately calculate \(a \times b\).
- **Proficient:** These students should easily factorize the quadratic and understand that \(a \times b = -28\), directly leading them to the correct answer.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level will not only easily solve the factorization but also quickly recognize the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and the constant term, making them highly likely to choose the correct answer.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25% (Struggling to apply concepts, might guess or apply incorrect relationships)
- **Basic:** A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20% (Starting to understand factorization but might confuse operations or relationships)
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10% (Confident in factorization, understands coefficient relationships)
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5% (Very confident, quickly recognizes \(a \times b\) as \(-28\))

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
