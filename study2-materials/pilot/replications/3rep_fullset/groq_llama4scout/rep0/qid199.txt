To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or areas of difficulty.

The question asks to identify which of the two numbers, \( \sqrt{36} \) and \( \sqrt{12} \), are rational. A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) of two integers, where \( q \) is non-zero. 

- \( \sqrt{36} = 6 \) because \( 6^2 = 36 \). Since 6 can be expressed as \( \frac{6}{1} \), it is a rational number.
- \( \sqrt{12} \) cannot be simplified into a whole number because there is no whole number that, when squared, equals 12. However, \( \sqrt{12} \) can be expressed as \( \sqrt{4 \times 3} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3} \). Since \( 2\sqrt{3} \) involves \( \sqrt{3} \), which is an irrational number, \( \sqrt{12} \) is not a rational number.

## Step 1: Understanding the Concepts
Students need to understand what makes a number rational and be able to simplify square roots to identify if they result in rational or irrational numbers.

## 2: Analyzing \( \sqrt{36} \)
\( \sqrt{36} \) simplifies to 6, which is rational. This part is straightforward.

## 3: Analyzing \( \sqrt{12} \)
\( \sqrt{12} \) simplifies to \( 2\sqrt{3} \), which is irrational because it includes \( \sqrt{3} \), an irrational component.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic concepts of square roots and rational numbers. They might incorrectly identify \( \sqrt{12} \) as rational (B) because they don't understand how to simplify it or don't recognize \( \sqrt{3} \) as irrational. Some might choose (C) Neither because they don't understand either square root. (A) \( \sqrt{36} \) seems easy, but if they can't simplify \( \sqrt{12} \), they might get confused.
- **Basic**: At this level, students should recognize \( \sqrt{36} \) as rational but might still struggle with \( \sqrt{12} \). They might choose (A) because they know \( \sqrt{36} = 6 \) is rational but aren't sure about \( \sqrt{12} \) or might incorrectly think \( \sqrt{12} \) is rational.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students should easily identify \( \sqrt{36} \) as rational and \( \sqrt{12} \) as irrational. They are likely to choose (A) because only \( \sqrt{36} \) is rational.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will not only easily identify \( \sqrt{36} \) as rational and \( \sqrt{12} \) as irrational but also understand that \( \sqrt{12} \) can be expressed as \( 2\sqrt{3} \), confirming their choice of (A).

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (recognize \( \sqrt{36} \) as rational but unsure about \( \sqrt{12} \)), B=20% (incorrectly think \( \sqrt{12} \) is rational), C=30% (neither, due to confusion), D=10% (both, unlikely but possible due to a lack of understanding).
- **Basic**: A=60% (correctly identify \( \sqrt{36} \) as rational), B=15% (some still confused about \( \sqrt{12} \)), C=20% (neither), D=5% (both).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (easily identify \( \sqrt{36} \) as rational and \( \sqrt{12} \) as irrational), B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=90% (confidently choose \( \sqrt{36} \)), B=2%, C=5%, D=3%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=5% D=3%
