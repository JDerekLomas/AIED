To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding related to types of data.

The question asks about the type of data Leanne is collecting by asking, "Describe how you feel when you are about to go on holiday." This question clearly invites a descriptive response, which is a hallmark of qualitative data. Qualitative data is non-numerical and often involves descriptions or qualities.

## Understanding the types of data:
- **Primary data** is collected firsthand by the researcher, which applies here since Leanne is directly collecting the data from her questionnaire.
- **Quantitative data** is numerical, which does not apply here because the question asks for a description, not a number.
- **Qualitative data** is non-numerical and involves descriptions or qualities, which applies here.
- **Secondary data** is collected from existing sources, not directly by the researcher, which does not apply here.
- **Attribute data** could sometimes refer to categorical data, which might seem relevant but is less commonly used in this context; however, given the qualitative nature, it's about describing attributes (feelings) rather than quantifying them.

Given these definitions:
- The data is **primary** because Leanne is collecting it directly.
- The data is **qualitative** because it involves descriptions of feelings.

## Predicted student responses based on ability levels:

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with understanding the nuances between quantitative and qualitative data. They might also not fully grasp the concept of primary vs. secondary data.
- A=30% (Some might mistakenly think it's quantitative because they associate "data" with numbers.)
- B=10% (Less likely to consider it secondary data since they're directly collecting it.)
- C=20% (Might confuse with attribute or categorical data due to a lack of clear understanding.)
- D=40% (A significant portion might understand it's primary and qualitative.)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make mistakes due to lack of clarity on concepts.
- A=20% (Mistakenly quantitative.)
- B=5% (Secondary data seems unlikely.)
- C=15% (Attribute/Categorical might seem plausible but less so with growing understanding.)
- D=60% (Most would understand it's primary qualitative data.)

### proficient
At this level, students have a solid grasp of data types.
- A=5% (Very few would mistake it for quantitative.)
- B=2% (Recognize it's not secondary data.)
- C=10% (Some might entertain attribute data but understand it's not the best fit.)
- D=83% (Most understand it's primary qualitative data.)

### advanced
Students here have a nuanced understanding and can apply concepts accurately.
- A=1% (Rarely would they confuse it with quantitative.)
- B=1% (Understand it's primary, not secondary.)
- C=5% (Might consider attribute but swiftly rule it out.)
- D=93% (Overwhelmingly, they would correctly identify it as primary qualitative data.)

Thus, the predictions are:

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=5% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=10% D=83%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=5% D=93%
