To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the options provided.

The question asks to identify the most appropriate name for the statement \(p-3 \equiv-(3-p)\). This requires an understanding of the definitions of equation, expression, formula, and identity in mathematics.

- An **equation** is a statement that two mathematical expressions have the same value, often containing variables.
- An **expression** is a collection of numbers, symbols, and/or operators that represents a value.
- A **formula** is a type of equation that expresses a relationship between variables, often used to describe a rule or a relationship.
- An **identity** is a specific type of equation that is true for all values of the variables involved.

The given statement \(p-3 \equiv-(3-p)\) can be simplified to show it is true for all values of \(p\). Simplifying:

\(p - 3 = -(3 - p)\)

\(p - 3 = -3 + p\)

\(p - 3 = p - 3\)

This shows that the statement is indeed an **identity** because it is true for all values of \(p\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Concepts
Students need to understand the definitions of equation, expression, formula, and identity to answer this question correctly.

## 2: Analyzing the Statement
The statement \(p-3 \equiv-(3-p)\) is always true, which aligns with the definition of an identity.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the nuances between equation, expression, formula, and identity. They might confuse the terms or not recognize the statement as an identity. There's a high chance they could choose **A: Equation** (40%) because it's a common term and they might not grasp the "always true" aspect. **B: Expression** (30%) could also be chosen as it's a basic term. **D: Identity** (20%) might be less likely if they don't understand the concept. **C: Formula** (10%) seems less likely but possible.

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a better grasp of basic concepts but might still struggle with the distinction. They are more likely to recognize it as an **equation** (50%) or might start to understand it's something special like an **identity** (30%). **Expression** (15%) and **Formula** (5%) seem less likely.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the concepts well and should recognize the statement as an **identity** (80%) because they know it's true for all values of \(p\). **Equation** (15%) might still be considered, but **expression** (3%) and **formula** (2%) are less likely.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students have a deep understanding and should easily identify the statement as an **identity** (95%). The other options are less likely: **Equation** (4%), **Expression** (0.5%), and **Formula** (0.5%).

## 4: Assigning Percentages
Based on the analysis:

- **Below Basic:** A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
- **Basic:** A=50% B=15% C=5% D=30%
- **Proficient:** A=15% B=3% C=2% D=80%
- **Advanced:** A=4% B=0.5% C=0.5% D=95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=15% B=3% C=2% D=80%
advanced: A=4% B=0.5% C=0.5% D=95%
