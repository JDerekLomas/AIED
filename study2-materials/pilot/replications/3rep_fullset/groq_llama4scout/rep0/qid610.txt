To approach this question, let's analyze each option with respect to the concept of real solutions, particularly focusing on the discriminant of quadratic equations when they are expanded.

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept of Real Solutions
A quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) has real solutions if and only if its discriminant \(D = b^2 - 4ac\) is greater than or equal to zero. If \(D < 0\), the equation has no real solutions.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \((w+5)^2 + 25 = 0\). Expanding this gives \(w^2 + 10w + 25 + 25 = 0\), which simplifies to \(w^2 + 10w + 50 = 0\). The discriminant \(D = 10^2 - 4(1)(50) = 100 - 200 = -100\). Since \(D < 0\), this equation indeed has no real solutions.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \((w+5)^2 - 25 = 0\). Expanding gives \(w^2 + 10w + 25 - 25 = 0\), simplifying to \(w^2 + 10w = 0\). This can be further simplified to \(w(w + 10) = 0\), which has solutions \(w = 0\) and \(w = -10\). Thus, it has real solutions.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \((w+5)^2 - 5 = 0\). Expanding gives \(w^2 + 10w + 25 - 5 = 0\), which simplifies to \(w^2 + 10w + 20 = 0\). The discriminant \(D = 10^2 - 4(1)(20) = 100 - 80 = 20\). Since \(D > 0\), this equation has real solutions.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \((w+5)^2 = 0\). This simplifies to \(w + 5 = 0\), which has a real solution \(w = -5\).

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and understanding of quadratic equations. They might not correctly identify which equation has no real solutions but could mistakenly choose based on superficial characteristics. Option A seems likely to be chosen because it's the only one that looks like it could be problematic due to the addition of 25.
  - below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of algebra but might still make errors in calculating discriminants or solving equations. They are more likely to recognize that Option A has a problem due to its form.
  - basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%

- **Proficient**: These students are likely to correctly solve or analyze each option, recognizing that only Option A clearly has no real solutions due to its positive constant term that shifts the parabola upwards.
  - proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to quickly and accurately analyze the equations, immediately recognizing the effect of the constant term on the existence of real roots.
  - advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
