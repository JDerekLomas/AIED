To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question essentially tests the understanding of the relationship between the notation of adding \(a + b\) and then dividing by \(c\), and the notation of \((a + b) \div c\). Both expressions are mathematically equivalent due to the definition of division as the inverse operation of multiplication and the associative property of addition and multiplication over division.

## Step 1: Understanding the Mathematical Equivalence
The expression \(\frac{a+b}{c}\) and \((a+b) \div c\) are mathematically equivalent because dividing by \(c\) is the same as multiplying by \(\frac{1}{c}\), and the fraction \(\frac{a+b}{c}\) directly implies \((a+b) \times \frac{1}{c}\) which is \((a+b) \div c\). This equivalence does not depend on the specific values of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) (except \(c\) cannot be 0, but that's not specified as a condition in the question).

## 2: Potential Misconceptions and Student Understanding
- Students with a below_basic understanding might not fully comprehend the notation or the mathematical operations involved, potentially leading them to choose "sometimes true" or "never true" due to a lack of understanding of the equivalence.
- Students at a basic level might be familiar with the operations but could still be prone to suggesting "sometimes true" if they think the relationship could fail under certain conditions (e.g., division by zero, though \(c=0\) is not explicitly excluded).
- Proficient students should understand the mathematical equivalence and hence choose "always true".
- Advanced students, having a deeper understanding, would also recognize the equivalence and choose "always true", but might be more critical about the conditions (e.g., \(c \neq 0\)).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
Given that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are different numbers but no restriction against \(c = 0\) is mentioned, a subtle trap exists for those not paying close attention. However, mathematically, \(\frac{a+b}{c} = (a+b) \div c\) holds as long as \(c \neq 0\), which is a condition usually implicitly understood in such contexts.

- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with the notation. They could think it's "sometimes true" (40%) because they see \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are different but don't fully grasp the operations; "never true" (30%) if they mistakenly believe there's always a condition making it false; "always true" (20%) if they accidentally apply a rote rule; and "need more information" (10%) if they recognize \(c=0\) could be an issue.
  
- **Basic**: Students here might lean towards "always true" (50%) because they see the direct equivalence; "sometimes true" (30%) if they consider possible exceptions; "never true" (10%) if misconceiving the operations; and "need more information" (10%).

- **Proficient**: These students are likely to choose "always true" (70%) since they understand the equivalence; "sometimes true" (20%) for those considering edge cases; and smaller percentages for "never true" (5%) and "need more information" (5%).

- **Advanced**: Advanced students would likely choose "always true" (90%) with a clear understanding that as long as \(c \neq 0\), the statement holds; a small percentage might consider "sometimes true" (5%) or other options due to overthinking conditions.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
