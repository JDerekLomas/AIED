To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question presents a rectangle with one part shaded and asks students to identify the correct calculation for the area of the shaded section. The dimensions given are 20 (total length), 8 (width of the entire rectangle and the unshaded part), and 6 (length of the unshaded part). The shaded part's dimensions can be inferred as 14 (20 - 6) in length and 8 in width.

## Step 1: Understand the Correct Calculation
The correct calculation for the area of the shaded part involves finding the area of the whole rectangle and subtracting the area of the unshaded part. The area of the whole rectangle is \(20 \times 8\), but since we are working with parts of it, we focus on the shaded area directly: \(8 \times 14\) (since 14 is the length of the shaded part, \(20 - 6 = 14\)).

## 2: Calculate the Area of the Shaded Part Directly
The area of the shaded part can be calculated directly as \(8 \times 14\). 

## 3: Compare with Given Options
- Option A: \(8 \times 20 - 8 \times 6\). This simplifies to \(160 - 48 = 112\), which is \(8 \times 14\).
- Option B: \(8 \times 20 + 8 \times 6\). This adds the areas, not subtracts, and clearly doesn't represent the shaded area.
- Option C: \(8 \times 14 - 8 \times 6\). This seems to subtract an area from the shaded part.
- Option D: \(8 \times 14 + 8 \times 6\). This adds the shaded and unshaded areas.

## 4: Identify the Correct Option
The correct calculation directly for the shaded area, based on given numbers, is \(8 \times 14\), which equals \(8 \times (20 - 6)\) or \(8 \times 20 - 8 \times 6\). Therefore, the correct option is A.

## 5: Analyze Potential Student Errors
- A common misconception might be adding instead of subtracting (or vice versa), which could lead students to choose B or C/D if they're not careful.
- Students might struggle with extracting the correct dimensions or applying them correctly.

## 6: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with basic area calculations and identifying relevant dimensions. They might choose B (adding areas) because it seems straightforward but incorrect, or D for similar reasons. A=30% (because it directly matches a simple subtraction they might understand), B=40%, C=15%, D=15%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic concepts but might make simple arithmetic errors. A=60%, B=25%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand area calculations well and are less likely to make errors in identifying the correct formula. A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to get it right immediately. A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
