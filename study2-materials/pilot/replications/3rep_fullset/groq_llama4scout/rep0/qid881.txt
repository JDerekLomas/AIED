## Step 1: Understand the sequence and its pattern
The given sequence starts with 3 and increases by 2 for each subsequent term: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...

## 2: Identify the correct formula for the nth term
To find the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, we use the formula \(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\), where \(a_n\) is the nth term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(n\) is the term number, and \(d\) is the common difference. For this sequence, \(a_1 = 3\) and \(d = 2\). So, \(a_n = 3 + (n - 1)2 = 3 + 2n - 2 = 2n + 1\).

## 3: Analyze option A
Option A is \(2n\). This would give 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ... for \(n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\), which does not match the sequence given.

## 4: Analyze option B
Option B is "Double, add 1". If we apply this rule starting from 3: double 3 is 6, add 1 is 7; double 7 is 14, add 1 is 15. This does not generate the sequence provided.

## 5: Analyze option C
Option C is \(2n + 1\). Using the formula from Step 2, this matches our derived formula for the nth term: for \(n = 1\), \(2*1 + 1 = 3\); for \(n = 2\), \(2*2 + 1 = 5\); and so on, which correctly generates the sequence.

## 6: Analyze option D
Option D is "Add 2 each time". While it's true that each term increases by 2, this option does not provide a direct expression for the nth term.

## 7: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand or apply the sequence formula. They might choose A or D due to a lack of understanding of how to express the nth term or misinterpret the sequence's pattern.
- **Basic**: Basic level students might recognize the sequence's pattern but struggle with expressing it algebraically. They might be tempted by A or B because they seem simple but don't accurately represent the sequence.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students should be able to identify the sequence as arithmetic with a common difference of 2 and derive or recognize the formula \(2n + 1\). They are likely to choose C.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will easily recognize the sequence and its formula, likely choosing C without hesitation.

## 8: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple but incorrect), B=20% (misinterprets the pattern), C=20% (some might guess or understand), D=20% (describes the pattern but not the nth term).
- **Basic**: A=30%, B=15%, C=40% (starting to understand sequences), D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 9: Adjust and finalize estimates
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=50% (very basic, incorrect), B=25%, C=15%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: A=40%, B=20%, C=30%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=15%, B=5%, C=75%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=0%, C=90%, D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=5% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%
