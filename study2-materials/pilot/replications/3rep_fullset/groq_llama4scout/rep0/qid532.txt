## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question provides three vertices of a rectangle and asks for the coordinates of the fourth vertex. The given vertices are \( (0,3) \), \( (4,-1) \), and \( (2,-3) \).

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception in geometry is not fully understanding the properties of a rectangle, specifically that opposite sides are equal in length and parallel. However, this question can be solved by recognizing that the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other.

## 3: Solving the Question
To find the fourth vertex, we can use the property that the diagonals of a rectangle intersect at their midpoints. First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal formed by \( (0,3) \) and \( (2,-3) \):
\[ \text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{0+2}{2}, \frac{3+(-3)}{2} \right) = (1, 0) \]

## 4: Finding the Fourth Vertex
The midpoint of the diagonal formed by the other two points (the given third point and the unknown fourth point) must also be \( (1, 0) \). Let's denote the fourth vertex as \( (x, y) \) and use \( (4, -1) \) and \( (x, y) \) to find it:
\[ \left( \frac{4+x}{2}, \frac{-1+y}{2} \right) = (1, 0) \]
This gives us two equations:
\[ \frac{4+x}{2} = 1 \]
\[ \frac{-1+y}{2} = 0 \]
Solving these:
\[ 4 + x = 2 \]
\[ x = -2 \]
And:
\[ -1 + y = 0 \]
\[ y = 1 \]
So, the fourth vertex is \( (-2, 1) \).

## 5: Analyzing Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with coordinate geometry and properties of shapes. They might not recognize how to use the given points to find the fourth vertex or might incorrectly apply properties of rectangles. Option C \( (-2,1) \) is the correct answer, but these students might choose any option randomly or based on a misconception. Let's assume A=20%, B=20%, C=30%, D=30%.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of geometry and coordinates. They might recognize the need to use properties of rectangles but could struggle with the calculation or identifying the correct property to apply. They are more likely to choose the correct option but might be tempted by options that seem plausible. Let's assume A=10%, B=15%, C=60%, D=15%.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand the properties of rectangles and can apply them to find the solution. They are likely to calculate the fourth vertex correctly using the midpoint or other geometric properties. Let's assume A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the properties but can also efficiently solve the problem. They would quickly identify the correct fourth vertex. Let's assume A=0%, B=0%, C=90%, D=10%.

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- **basic**: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
