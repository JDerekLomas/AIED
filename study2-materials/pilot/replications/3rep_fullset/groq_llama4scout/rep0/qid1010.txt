To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and evaluate their correctness.

Tom says \( 918 \div 34 = 934 \div 18 \).

To verify Tom's statement, let's calculate both divisions:
- \( 918 \div 34 \approx 27 \)
- \( 934 \div 18 \approx 51.89 \)

Clearly, Tom's statement is incorrect because \( 27 \neq 51.89 \).

Katie says \( 918 \div 34 = 34 \div 918 \).

This implies \( 918 \div 34 = 34 \div 918 \).

Let's calculate both:
- \( 918 \div 34 \approx 27 \)
- \( 34 \div 918 \approx 0.037 \)

Katie's statement is also incorrect because \( 27 \neq 0.037 \).

Given that both Tom and Katie are incorrect, the correct answer is D) Neither is correct.

Now, let's consider the likely responses of students at different ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand division or how to compare the statements. They might randomly select an answer or choose based on a superficial understanding. Given the nature of the question, it's likely that a significant portion would incorrectly choose A, B, or C due to misunderstanding the concepts. However, without strong foundational knowledge, they might also select D if they recognize both statements as incorrect.

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of division but might struggle with more complex relationships or abstract thinking. They might still fall into traps or not fully grasp the equality relationships presented. A notable percentage might still choose A or B, thinking one of the statements could be true, but a significant portion would recognize both as incorrect.

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of division and are more likely to evaluate the statements critically. They should quickly see that both Tom's and Katie's statements are incorrect, leading to a higher percentage choosing D.

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand division well but are also adept at analyzing and critiquing mathematical statements. They would easily identify the errors in both Tom's and Katie's statements and choose D.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=30% B=25% C=10% D=35%
- **Proficient**: A=15% B=10% C=5% D=70%
- **Advanced**: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%

Therefore, in the exact format requested:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=15% B=10% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
