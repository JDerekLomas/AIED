To approach this question, let's first substitute \(h=10\) and \(j=4\) into each of the expressions given in the options to see which pair of statements is true.

## Step 1: Evaluate \(h(j+2)\) and \(h(2+j)\) for \(h=10\) and \(j=4\)
Given \(h=10\) and \(j=4\), let's calculate \(h(j+2)\) and \(h(2+j)\):
- \(h(j+2) = 10(4+2) = 10 \times 6 = 60\)
- \(h(2+j) = 10(2+4) = 10 \times 6 = 60\)

## 2: Compare Calculations with Given Options
Now, let's compare these calculations with the options provided:
- A: \(h(j+2)=60\) and \(h(2+j)=-60\). This does not match our calculations.
- B: \(h(j+2)=42\) and \(h(2+j)=24\). This does not match.
- C: \(h(j+2)=24\) and \(h(2+j)=42\). This does not match.
- D: \(h(j+2)=60\) and \(h(2+j)=60\). This matches our calculations.

## 3: Analyze the Difficulty and Misconceptions
The question requires students to substitute values into expressions and evaluate them. The potential misconception here could involve incorrect substitution or calculation. However, given that \(h(j+2)\) and \(h(2+j)\) yield the same result due to the commutative property of addition (i.e., \(j+2 = 2+j\)), the correct answer is quite straightforward once the calculations are done.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and substitutions. They might incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the operations, potentially leading to a spread across incorrect options, but given the simplicity of the calculations, they might still stumble upon the correct answer by chance or through incorrect but converging calculations. \(A=20\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=40\%\)
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and are more likely to perform the calculations correctly but might still make careless mistakes. \(A=10\%\), \(B=15\%\), \(C=15\%\), \(D=60\%\)
- **Proficient:** These students are expected to handle algebraic expressions with ease and are less likely to make calculation errors. They should quickly identify the correct option. \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=85\%\)
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebra and are highly unlikely to make mistakes in such straightforward calculations. \(A=0\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=0\%\), \(D=100\%\)

The best answer is D. 

Below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
Basic: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
