To approach this question, let's analyze the potential difficulties and common misconceptions related to multiplying out brackets, particularly with negative numbers.

The question requires the student to multiply out the brackets in the expression \( -3(m-2) \). A common misconception when dealing with expressions like this is not applying the negative sign correctly to the terms inside the brackets.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Process
The correct process to multiply out \( -3(m-2) \) involves distributing the \( -3 \) across the terms inside the brackets: \( -3 \times m - (-3) \times 2 \). This simplifies to \( -3m + 6 \), because \( -(-3) \times 2 = 3 \times 2 = 6 \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common error is to forget to change the sign of the terms inside the brackets when multiplying by a negative number. So, instead of \( -3m + 6 \), a student might incorrectly calculate it as \( -3m - 6 \) (option B), or they might distribute the negative sign incorrectly in other ways.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 3m + 6 \) suggests a misunderstanding of both the distribution and the sign.
- Option B: \( -3m - 6 \) indicates a failure to apply the negative sign correctly to the second term.
- Option C: \( 3m - 6 \) implies a mistake in handling the negative sign in front of the \( 3 \).
- Option D: \( -3m + 6 \) is the correct answer.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level are likely to struggle significantly. They might not understand the concept of distributing or handling negative signs properly. Therefore, their answers could be scattered across all options, but with a significant proportion choosing A or B due to a lack of understanding of negative signs and distribution. Let's predict: A=30% B=35% C=20% D=15%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make errors, especially with negative signs. They are more likely to get the distribution wrong or mishandle the negative sign. So, a notable percentage might choose B. Let's predict: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the process but might still make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose D but with some possibility of choosing B if they forget to change the sign. Let's predict: A=5% B=20% C=5% D=70%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident and understand the material well. They are unlikely to make mistakes. Let's predict: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%.

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=30% B=35% C=20% D=15%
- basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
- proficient: A=5% B=20% C=5% D=70%
- advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=35% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=20% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
