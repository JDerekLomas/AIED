To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 0.2=\frac{1}{5}=? \% \), let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions.

The question tests the understanding of converting a decimal to a percentage and the equivalence between decimals, fractions, and percentages. The conversion of 0.2 to a percentage is straightforward: \(0.2 \times 100 = 20\%\), and \(\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\), which also equals \(20\%\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question is \( 0.2=\frac{1}{5}=? \% \). This requires students to understand that 0.2 is equal to \(\frac{1}{5}\) and then convert 0.2 to a percentage.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrectly converting decimals to percentages or fractions. However, in this case, the numbers are simple and well-known. Another potential error could be misunderstanding the relationship between fractions, decimals, and percentages, but the equality \( 0.2 = \frac{1}{5} \) is a basic fact.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 15 \% \)
- Option B: \( 20 \% \)
- Option C: \( 50 \% \)
- Option D: \( 2 \% \)

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions. They might not recognize \( \frac{1}{5} \) as 0.2 or might incorrectly convert 0.2 to a percentage. Given the simplicity of the numbers, some might choose B if they have a basic understanding, but others might be confused. A=10%, B=40%, C=30%, D=20% seems plausible because these students might have a higher chance of selecting incorrect options due to a lack of foundational knowledge.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple mistakes. They likely know \( \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \) and can convert 0.2 to 20%, so B=80% seems high. A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with conversions and should easily identify that \( 0.2 = 20\% \). Thus, B=95%, A=2%, C=2%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and are unlikely to make mistakes on such a straightforward question. B=99%, A=0.5%, C=0.5%, D=0%.

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the above analysis and adjusting for a more realistic distribution considering typical student performance:
- **below_basic**: A=5% B=60% C=20% D=15%
- **basic**: A=2% B=85% C=10% D=3%
- **proficient**: A=1% B=95% C=3% D=1%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%

The best answer is B. 

Therefore, based on typical student responses and adjusting for clarity:
below_basic: A=5% B=60% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=2% B=85% C=10% D=3%
proficient: A=1% B=95% C=3% D=1%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
