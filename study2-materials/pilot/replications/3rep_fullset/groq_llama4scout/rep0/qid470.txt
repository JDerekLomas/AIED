To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given subtraction problem, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The subtraction problem is: $503 - 98$.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception in subtraction, especially with regrouping, is incorrectly handling the borrowing process. However, in this case, the numbers are such that $503 - 98$ can be computed directly or by using a mental math strategy without needing to borrow from the hundreds place (e.g., $503 - 100 = 403$, then $403 + 2 = 405$).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: $495$ could result from incorrectly subtracting $8$ from $503$ without properly accounting for the $90$ in $98$.
- Option B: $415$ seems like an arbitrary incorrect answer.
- Option C: $405$ is the correct answer.
- Option D: $595$ seems to be an addition error.

## 3: Assessing Difficulty by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic subtraction facts and the concept of regrouping. They are likely to make significant errors.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors, especially if they misinterpret the subtraction process.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the subtraction process, including regrouping, and are less likely to make errors on straightforward problems.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to solve problems efficiently and accurately.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given the straightforward nature of the problem and the fact that it doesn't inherently suggest a complex calculation or a common misconception trap (like a "borrowing" mistake in a more complex problem), we can make some predictions:
- The correct answer, $405$, should be selected by a high percentage of students, especially those at the proficient and advanced levels.
- Errors might arise from miscalculations or not following through with the subtraction correctly.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
- **Below Basic**: Might have difficulty, so let's say A=20% (incorrect but close), B=15% (random error), C=40% (correct, but with significant struggle), D=25% (addition error).
- **Basic**: Should be getting it right more often, so A=10%, B=10%, C=70%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Expected to get it right, so A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Highly likely to get it right, so A=2%, B=2%, C=92%, D=4%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=92% D=4%
