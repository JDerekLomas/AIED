## Step 1: Understand the question and the ratio
The question states that Jess and Heena share sweets in the ratio \(3 : 5\). Jess gets \(15\) sweets, and we need to find out how many sweets Heena gets.

## 2: Determine the factor by which the ratio is multiplied
To find out how many sweets Heena gets, first, we need to determine the factor by which the ratio \(3 : 5\) is multiplied to get Jess's \(15\) sweets. Since Jess's part of the ratio is \(3\), we divide \(15\) by \(3\) to find this factor: \(15 / 3 = 5\).

## 3: Calculate Heena's sweets
Using the factor found in Step 2, we multiply Heena's part of the ratio, \(5\), by this factor to find out how many sweets Heena gets: \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

## 4: Analyze the difficulty of the question
This question tests the application of ratios. The potential misconception here could be misunderstanding how to apply the ratio or calculating the multiplier incorrectly. However, the numbers given are straightforward, and the ratio is simple.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding ratios or applying them correctly. They might not recognize that to find Heena's sweets, they need to multiply her part of the ratio by the same factor that Jess's part was multiplied by. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, possibly choosing options that seem like simple additions or subtractions related to the numbers given (A=30%, B=20%, C=20%, D=30%).
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding of ratios but might make calculation errors. They are likely to attempt to solve it but might get the factor wrong or misapply it. The correct answer, D=25, seems likely for many, but some might choose A or B due to miscalculation (A=10%, B=5%, C=5%, D=80%).
- **Proficient**: These students understand ratios well and are likely to solve the problem accurately. They will correctly identify the multiplier and apply it. Expect a high percentage to choose D=25 (A=5%, B=0%, C=0%, D=95%).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand ratios but are also adept at more complex applications. They will easily solve this and are unlikely to choose incorrect options (A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%).

## 6: Adjust predictions based on common misconceptions and question specifics
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the simplicity of the numbers involved, even students who are below basic might have a chance at getting it right if they've seen similar questions, and advanced students will certainly get it right.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
