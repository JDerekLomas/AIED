## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to find the radius of a sphere given its volume \(V \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\). The formula for the volume of a sphere is \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius.

## 2: Deriving the Formula for Radius
To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we rearrange the volume formula:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Comparing with Given Options
Comparing the derived formula \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\) with the given options:
- A: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \)
- B: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \)
- C: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \)
- D: \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \)

## 4: Identifying the Correct Option
The correct formula for the radius is option C: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulation and formula rearrangement. They might incorrectly apply formulas or forget steps. Option D seems to incorrectly manipulate the formula, which might appeal to some students who misunderstand how to solve for \(r\). Given the nature of the question, a significant portion might choose incorrectly, but let's assume a distribution where most struggle: A=20%, B=20%, C=30%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make simple algebraic mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the correct formula but could be tempted by options that seem plausible: A=15%, B=15%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to solve the problem correctly with minimal errors. They understand the formula and can rearrange it: A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are very familiar with the formulas and manipulations. They are less likely to make errors: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the steps and understanding of student abilities:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
