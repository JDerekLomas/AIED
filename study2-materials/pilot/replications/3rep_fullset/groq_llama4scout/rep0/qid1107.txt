To approach this question, let's first analyze what it's testing: the ability to eliminate a variable in simultaneous equations by either adding or subtracting the equations. The specific equations given are:
\[ \begin{array}{l}3 x-2 y=15 \\ x+2 y=20\end{array} \]

## Step 1: Understand the Conditions for Eliminating a Variable
To eliminate a variable, the coefficients of either \(x\) or \(y\) must be the same in both equations but with opposite signs when subtracting, or the same when adding.

## 2: Analyze Tom's Statement
Tom suggests adding the two equations together to eliminate a variable. If we add them:
\[ (3x - 2y) + (x + 2y) = 15 + 20 \]
\[ 3x + x - 2y + 2y = 35 \]
\[ 4x = 35 \]
This simplifies to \( 4x = 35 \), which means \( x = \frac{35}{4} \). This shows that adding the equations does eliminate \(y\), making Tom correct.

## 3: Analyze Katie's Statement
Katie suggests subtracting the two equations to eliminate a variable. If we subtract the second equation from the first:
\[ (3x - 2y) - (x + 2y) = 15 - 20 \]
\[ 3x - x - 2y - 2y = -5 \]
\[ 2x - 4y = -5 \]
This does not eliminate a variable directly as Katie hoped (it was supposed to eliminate \(x\) or \(y\) directly), but let's check if subtracting could eliminate a variable with a different arrangement. The equations are:
\[ \begin{array}{l}3 x-2 y=15 \\ x+2 y=20\end{array} \]
If we multiply the second equation by 3 and the first by 1:
\[ \begin{array}{l}3 x-2 y=15 \\ 3x+6 y=60\end{array} \]
Then subtract:
\[ (3x - 2y) - (3x + 6y) = 15 - 60 \]
\[ -8y = -45 \]
\[ y = \frac{45}{8} \]
However, directly subtracting or adding as originally stated:
- Adding eliminates \(y\).
- Subtracting as stated doesn't directly eliminate a variable without further manipulation.

## 4: Directly Evaluate Katie's Original Claim
Given:
\[ \begin{array}{l}3 x-2 y=15 \\ x+2 y=20\end{array} \]
Subtracting:
\[ (3x - 2y) - (x + 2y) = 15 - 20 \]
\[ 2x - 4y = -5 \]
Does not directly help. But if we want to eliminate \(y\), we see that adding works. For \(x\), consider:
If we multiply the second equation by 3:
\[ 3x + 6y = 60 \]
And the first remains:
\[ 3x - 2y = 15 \]
Subtracting these:
\[ (3x + 6y) - (3x - 2y) = 60 - 15 \]
\[ 8y = 45 \]
\[ y = \frac{45}{8} \]
So, Katie's method requires a manipulation to eliminate \(x\), not straightforward.

## 5: Determine the Correctness of Each Statement
- Tom is correct because adding the equations eliminates \(y\).
- Katie's statement to subtract and eliminate a variable directly is misleading without manipulation; the direct subtraction does not eliminate \(y\) or \(x\) easily.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
Given the clarity of the question and the straightforward nature of adding to eliminate \(y\), but the need for a bit of thought on subtraction:
- **Below Basic**: Might struggle to see either method clearly. A=40% (some see adding works), B=20% (some guess Katie), C=20% (not sure), D=20% (neither seems plausible).
- **Basic**: Would likely see Tom's method. A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Clearly see Tom's method and understand Katie needs adjustment. A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Understand both, with a nuanced view. A=5%, B=5%, C=90%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
