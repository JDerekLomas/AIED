To solve this, let's consider the probability of at least one ball being red when two balls are picked out of 9 (5 red, 4 yellow).

## Step 1: Calculate total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 9
The total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 9 is given by the combination formula \(C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\), where \(n = 9\) and \(k = 2\).
\[C(9, 2) = \frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = \frac{9 \times 8}{2 \times 1} = 36\]

## 2: Calculate the number of ways to pick 2 balls with at least one red ball
It's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event (both balls are yellow) and subtract it from 1.
- The number of ways to pick 2 yellow balls out of 4 is \(C(4, 2) = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6\).

## 3: Calculate the probability that both balls are yellow
The probability that both balls are yellow is \(\frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}\).

## 4: Calculate the probability that at least one ball is red
The probability that at least one ball is red is \(1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\).

## 5: Convert the probability to a fraction out of 72
To compare with the given options, convert \(\frac{5}{6}\) to a fraction out of 72:
\(\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{72}{72} = \frac{5 \times 12}{6 \times 12} = \frac{60}{72}\).

## 6: Analyze student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with combinations and probabilities. They might not calculate it correctly or might choose an option without calculation. Given the straightforward nature of this question once you understand the concept, they might still have a chance to pick the right answer if they've seen similar questions or if the calculation isn't too complex for them. However, errors in calculation or conceptual understanding could lead to choosing incorrect options. 
  - A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%

- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a good grasp of basic probability concepts. They might make simple calculation mistakes but should generally understand how to approach the problem.
  - A=10%, B=20%, C=60%, D=10%

- **Proficient**: Students at this level should accurately calculate probabilities and understand the concept of complementary events. They are likely to choose the correct answer.
  - A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them quickly and accurately. They might not even need to calculate the complementary event, directly calculating or reasoning out the probability.
  - A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%

The best answer is C.
