To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question about finding the midpoint of two coordinates, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might encounter.

The midpoint \(M\) of two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in a coordinate system is given by the formula:
\[M = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\]

For the points \((-4, 5)\) and \((6, 2)\), the midpoint is:
\[M = \left(\frac{-4 + 6}{2}, \frac{5 + 2}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{2}{2}, \frac{7}{2}\right) = (1, 3.5)\]

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the midpoint of the two given coordinates, \((-4,5)\) and \((6,2)\), which requires applying the midpoint formula.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be misapplying the formula or making calculation errors. Another could be misunderstanding the concept of a midpoint altogether, though this seems less likely given the straightforward nature of the question.

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A: \((1,3.5)\) is the correct calculation using the midpoint formula.

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B: \((5,3.5)\) suggests a miscalculation where the x-coordinate is incorrectly averaged or misunderstood.

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C: \((2,7)\) suggests adding the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately without dividing by 2.

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D: \((2,3)\) suggests a possible quick estimation or incorrect calculation.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic or misunderstanding the formula. They might choose options that reflect simple errors, such as C or D, due to miscalculation or not applying the formula correctly. Option C seems particularly tempting for those who add without dividing by 2.
- **Basic:** Students here might understand the formula but make calculation mistakes. They could choose B, C, or D due to errors in calculation.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept and can apply it. They are less likely to choose incorrect options unless they make a simple arithmetic mistake, making A the most likely choice.
- **Advanced:** These students are not only proficient but also likely to double-check their work. They would almost certainly choose A.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
- **Proficient:** A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced:** A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

Therefore:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
