To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Jo and Paul and evaluate their validity.

## Step 1: Evaluate Jo's Statement
Jo claims there is no value of \( m \) that means \( 3^{m} \) is even. To assess this, we need to consider the properties of powers of 3. Since 3 is an odd number, any power of 3 will also be odd because odd numbers multiplied by odd numbers always result in odd numbers. Therefore, Jo is correct.

## 2: Evaluate Paul's Statement
Paul claims there is no value of \( n \) that means \( 4^{n} \) ends in \( 0 \). To evaluate this, let's consider the pattern of \( 4^{n} \). When \( n = 1 \), \( 4^{1} = 4 \); when \( n = 2 \), \( 4^{2} = 16 \); when \( n = 3 \), \( 4^{3} = 64 \); and so on. It's observable that \( 4^{n} \) will always end in 4 or 6, but never in 0, because multiplying by 4 does not introduce a factor of 10 (which is necessary for a number to end in 0). Therefore, Paul is also correct.

## 3: Determine the Correctness of Each Statement and Predicted Student Responses
Given that both Jo and Paul are correct in their assertions, the correct answer is C) Both Jo and Paul.

## 4: Predict Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the properties of odd and even numbers and the patterns of powers. They might not fully grasp why \( 3^{m} \) is always odd or why \( 4^{n} \) never ends in 0. Therefore, they might be more likely to choose incorrect options or be uncertain. Predicted responses: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of number properties. They might understand that \( 3^{m} \) is always odd but could be less sure about the pattern of \( 4^{n} \). However, they are more likely to recognize both statements' validity. Predicted responses: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid grasp of mathematical concepts, including properties of numbers and patterns of powers. They should easily recognize the validity of both statements. Predicted responses: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also reason about them deeply. They will certainly recognize the correctness of both Jo and Paul's statements. Predicted responses: A=2% B=2% C=94% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=94% D=2%
