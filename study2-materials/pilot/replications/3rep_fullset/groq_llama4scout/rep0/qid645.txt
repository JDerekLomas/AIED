To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question about the size of angle \( w \) in an isosceles triangle, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents an isosceles triangle with one of the base angles labeled as \( w \) and the angle vertically opposite the vertex angle labeled as \( 27 \) degrees. In an isosceles triangle, the two base angles are equal.

## 2: Identifying the Key Concept
The key concept here is that the vertically opposite angles are equal. So, the vertex angle of the isosceles triangle is \( 27 \) degrees. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180 \) degrees, and the base angles are equal (let's denote both as \( w \)), we can set up the equation: \( w + w + 27 = 180 \).

## 3: Solving for \( w \)
Solving the equation:
\( 2w + 27 = 180 \)
\( 2w = 153 \)
\( w = 76.5 \) degrees

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Difficulty
- A common misconception might be to confuse the given angle with one of the base angles or to incorrectly apply properties of triangles.
- The question seems straightforward once the properties of isosceles and vertically opposite angles are recalled.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand properties of isosceles triangles or angle sums. They might choose \( A = 27^{\degree} \) assuming the labeled angle is one of the base angles or not know how to solve for \( w \), leading to A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic properties but might struggle with setting up the equation or recalling that vertically opposite angles are equal. They might still make errors, so A=20%, B=25%, C=30%, D=25%.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily recall that the triangle's angles sum to 180 degrees and that the base angles are equal. They might still occasionally confuse the angles, but largely, they should get it right. So, A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of geometric principles and should find the question straightforward. Thus, A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 6: Formatting the Response
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
