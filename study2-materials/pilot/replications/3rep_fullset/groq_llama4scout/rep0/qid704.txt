## Step 1: Understand the question and the shape described
The question describes a shape made up of a square and a rectangle. The perimeter of the entire shape is given as \( 30 \mathrm{~cm} \), and the area of the square is given as \( 16 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \). From the area of the square, we can determine that each side of the square is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 2: Determine the dimensions and perimeter of the shape
Given that the square has sides of \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \), and if we assume the rectangle's sides are \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \) (shared with the square) and \( x \mathrm{~cm} \) (the other side), the perimeter of the shape can be expressed as \( 4 + 4 + 4 + x + 4 + x = 30 \). Simplifying, \( 16 + 2x = 30 \), which leads to \( 2x = 14 \) and \( x = 7 \).

## 3: Calculate the area of the rectangle and the total shape
The area of the rectangle is \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \). The area of the square is given as \( 16 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \). Therefore, the total area of the shape is \( 16 + 28 = 44 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \).

## 4: Analyze the options and predict student responses
- Option A: \( 4 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) seems too small and incorrect.
- Option B: \( 60 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) could be a plausible mistake if students incorrectly calculate the dimensions or areas.
- Option C: \( 44 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) matches our calculation.
- Option D: \( 104 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) seems too large and incorrect.

## 5: Consider common misconceptions and student errors
Students might struggle with visualizing the shape, calculating perimeters and areas, or combining the areas of the square and rectangle correctly. A common error could be miscounting the sides for the perimeter or not correctly using the given area of the square to find side lengths.

## 6: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level choosing each option
- **Below Basic**: These students may struggle with basic calculations and understanding of shapes. They might choose A or D due to miscalculation or not understanding the question. A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level can understand and apply basic concepts but might make calculation errors. They are more likely to choose C but could be tempted by B. A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and can apply them accurately. They are likely to choose C. A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them to solve problems efficiently. They are very likely to choose C. A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
