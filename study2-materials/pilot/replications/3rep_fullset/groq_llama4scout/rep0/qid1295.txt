To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's first solve the problem and then consider the common misconceptions and difficulties students might face.

## Step 1: Solve the Problem
First, increase \( £200 \) by \( 50\% \):
\[ £200 \times 1.5 = £300 \]

Then, increase \( £300 \) by \( 10\% \):
\[ £300 \times 1.1 = £330 \]

## 2: Express the Final Amount as a Percentage of the Original
The original amount was \( £200 \), and the new amount is \( £330 \). To express \( £330 \) as a percentage of \( £200 \):
\[ \frac{£330}{£200} \times 100\% = 165\% \]

## 3: Analyze Potential Misconceptions and Difficulties
- A common misconception might be to add the percentages (50% + 10% = 60%) and then apply this to the original amount, which would not be correct.
- Another potential error could be in calculating the final amount or converting it back to a percentage of the original.

## 4: Consider Student Responses by Ability Level
### Below_Basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic percentage calculations and increases. They might incorrectly add the percentages or miscalculate the final amount.
- Correct answer (C: \( 165\% \)): 20%
- A: \( 155 \% \): 10% (might result from a miscalculation or incorrect rounding)
- B: \( 60 \% \): 30% (could result from adding percentages and misinterpreting)
- D: \( 330 \% \): 40% (might result from directly taking the final amount as a percentage without comparing to the original)

### Basic
Students at this level should have a better grasp of percentages but might still make straightforward calculation errors.
- Correct answer (C: \( 165\% \)): 50%
- A: \( 155 \% \): 20%
- B: \( 60 \% \): 15%
- D: \( 330 \% \): 15%

### Proficient
Students here are expected to handle percentage increases with ease but might occasionally make errors due to haste or oversight.
- Correct answer (C: \( 165\% \)): 80%
- A: \( 155 \% \): 10%
- B: \( 60 \% \): 5%
- D: \( 330 \% \): 5%

### Advanced
Students at this level are likely to understand the concepts well and apply them accurately.
- Correct answer (C: \( 165\% \)): 95%
- A: \( 155 \% \): 3%
- B: \( 60 \% \): 1%
- D: \( 330 \% \): 1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=3% B=1% C=95% D=1%
