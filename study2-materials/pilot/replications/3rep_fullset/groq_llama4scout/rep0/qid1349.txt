## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task requires predicting the percentage of students at different ability levels (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for a given question about transforming simultaneous equations to eliminate a variable.

## 2: Analyzing the Question
The question involves two simultaneous equations:
\(\begin{array}{l}
2 l+3 m=13 \\
3 l+4 m=17
\end{array}\)
Sandeep wants to eliminate \( l \) from these equations. To do so, he needs to transform both equations to make the coefficients of \( l \) the same but with opposite signs, or a multiple thereof, so he can add or subtract the equations to eliminate \( l \).

## 3: Identifying Correct Transformation
A common method to eliminate \( l \) is to multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2, which gives:
\(\begin{array}{l}
6 l+9 m=39 \\
6 l+8 m=34
\end{array}\)
This matches option D.

## 4: Evaluating Option A
Option A: \( \begin{array}{l}6 l+9 m=26 \\ 6 l+8 m=51\end{array} \)
This option does not match the correct transformation since multiplying the entire first equation by 3 and the second by 2 yields \( \begin{array}{l}6 l+9 m=39 \\ 6 l+8 m=34\end{array} \), not the numbers given in A.

## 5: Evaluating Option B
Option B: \( \begin{array}{l}6 l+9 m=13 \\ 6 l+8 m=17\end{array} \)
This option suggests multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second by 2 but applies these multipliers to the results (13 and 17) instead of the original equations, which is incorrect.

## 6: Evaluating Option C
Option C: \( \begin{array}{l}6 l+3 m=13 \\ 6 l+4 m=17\end{array} \)
This option incorrectly suggests that multiplying both equations by 3 would result in \( 6l + 3m = 13 \) and \( 6l + 4m = 17 \), which does not align with proper transformation to eliminate \( l \).

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the basic algebraic manipulations. They might choose B because it seems like a straightforward multiplication without understanding the consequences or might choose A/C due to confusion. D seems correct but might not be obvious. Prediction: A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might make errors in applying transformations. They are likely to recognize D as correct but might be tempted by A or B due to miscalculation. Prediction: A=10%, B=20%, C=10%, D=60%.
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and should easily identify D as the correct transformation. Prediction: A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will quickly and accurately identify the correct transformation and are less likely to consider incorrect options. Prediction: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 8: Finalizing Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
