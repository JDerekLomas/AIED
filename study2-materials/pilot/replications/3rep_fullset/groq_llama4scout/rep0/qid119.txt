To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The diagram shows an arrow representing a movement or value of -24, and a smaller arrow underneath it, which is a third of the length of the larger arrow, implying a value of -8 (since -24 / 3 = -8). The question revolves around two calculations:

1. Tom writes: \( -3 \times(-8)=-24 \)
2. Katie writes: \( \frac{(-24)}{-3}=-8 \)

Let's evaluate these expressions:

1. \( -3 \times(-8) = 24 \), not -24, because multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. So, Tom is incorrect.
2. \( \frac{(-24)}{-3} = 8 \), not -8, because dividing two negative numbers gives a positive result. So, Katie is incorrect.

Given this, the correct answer is that neither Tom nor Katie is correct, which corresponds to option D.

Now, let's consider the difficulty level and potential misconceptions:

- A common misconception is that multiplying or dividing negative numbers results in a negative number, or that the signs of the numbers being operated on directly dictate the sign of the result without considering the rules of signs.
- The context of the question, with visual aids, might help some students understand the relationship between the numbers, but it might also confuse them if they're not careful.

Predicting the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

## Step 1: Understanding the Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students who struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of negative numbers.
- **Basic**: Students who have a grasp of basic operations but may struggle with more complex applications or abstract concepts.
- **Proficient**: Students who understand the concepts but may make occasional errors due to carelessness or misunderstanding the context.
- **Advanced**: Students who not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately in various contexts.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Errors
- The question specifically tests the understanding of multiplying and dividing negative numbers. 
- **Below Basic**: Might struggle to evaluate either expression correctly due to a lack of understanding of negative number operations. They might incorrectly choose A or B because they don't fully grasp the mistake in Tom's or Katie's calculations.
- **Basic**: Could potentially understand the operations but might be tricked by the visual representation or make careless errors. They might choose A or B thinking one of the calculations is correct without fully evaluating both.
- **Proficient**: Should recognize the errors in both calculations but might be influenced by the context or make a calculation mistake under pressure.
- **Advanced**: Should easily identify both calculations as incorrect.

## 3: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (thinking Tom might be right due to not understanding multiplication of negatives), B=30% (similar reasoning for Katie), C=10% (not understanding either), D=20% (some might guess or partially understand).
- **Basic**: A=30%, B=25%, C=15%, D=30% (as they have a better grasp but still might make errors).
- **Proficient**: A=20%, B=15%, C=10%, D=55% (better understanding, more likely to spot both errors).
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=5%, C=0%, D=90% (clear understanding of operations).

## 4: Final Estimates
Given the analysis, the final estimates considering typical student performance and common misconceptions would be:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=15% C=5% D=60%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%

The best answer is D.
