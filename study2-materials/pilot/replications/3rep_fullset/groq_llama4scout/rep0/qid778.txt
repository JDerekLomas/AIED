To predict how students at different ability levels might respond to this question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or understanding related to solving equations.

The equation given is \(4(m-1) = 20\). The task is to evaluate the first steps suggested by Tom and Katie to solve this equation.

## Step 1: Understand the Correct Solution Steps
To solve \(4(m-1) = 20\), one correct step is to divide both sides by 4, yielding \(m - 1 = 5\), which matches Katie's suggestion. This is a straightforward and correct application of algebraic principles to isolate the variable term.

## 2: Evaluate Tom's Suggestion
Tom suggests \(4m = 21\). Let's see if this can be derived from the original equation:
\[4(m-1) = 20\]
\[4m - 4 = 20\]
\[4m = 24\]
So, Tom's suggestion does not match the correct manipulation of the equation.

## 3: Assessing Misconceptions and Understanding
- A common misconception could be not distributing the 4 correctly or not understanding how to isolate the variable term properly.
- Katie's step (\(m - 1 = 5\)) directly results from correctly applying division to both sides of the equation, which is a clear and correct first step.
- Tom's step (\(4m = 21\)) suggests an incorrect manipulation.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly distribute, or they might not understand how to solve for \(m\). Given Tom's and Katie's suggestions, a significant portion might choose incorrectly, but let's assume they have some intuition that Katie's method looks "right" because it's closer to a standard form. However, errors in calculation or misunderstanding of algebraic properties could lead to confusion.  
  - A (Only Tom): 20%  
  - B (Only Katie): 40%  
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 10%  
  - D (Neither is correct): 30%

- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding of algebra. They should recognize Katie's step as correct but might be confused by Tom's.  
  - A (Only Tom): 10%  
  - B (Only Katie): 60%  
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 5%  
  - D (Neither is correct): 25%

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic manipulations. They should easily see Katie's step as correct and Tom's as incorrect.  
  - A (Only Tom): 5%  
  - B (Only Katie): 80%  
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 0%  
  - D (Neither is correct): 15%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand algebra but can also analyze and critique different solution paths. They will certainly identify Katie's suggestion as correct and Tom's as incorrect.  
  - A (Only Tom): 0%  
  - B (Only Katie): 90%  
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 0%  
  - D (Neither is correct): 10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
