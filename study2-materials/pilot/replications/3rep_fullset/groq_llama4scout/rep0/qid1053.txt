To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question on factorizing the quadratic expression \(x^{2} - x - 6\), let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The expression \(x^{2} - x - 6\) can be factorized by finding two numbers that multiply to \(-6\) and add to \(-1\). These numbers are \(-3\) and \(2\) because \(-3 \times 2 = -6\) and \(-3 + 2 = -1\). Therefore, the correct factorization is \((x - 3)(x + 2)\), which corresponds to option A.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception students might have is not being able to identify the correct pair of numbers that add to the coefficient of \(x\) (in this case, \(-1\)) and multiply to the constant term (in this case, \(-6\)). This could lead to incorrect factorizations.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \((x - 3)(x - 2)\), suggests numbers that add to \(-5\), not \(-1\), and multiply to \(6\), not \(-6\). This seems unlikely to be chosen by students who have a basic understanding of factorization, as the mistake here is quite apparent.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \((x + 3)(x + 2)\), suggests numbers that add to \(5\), not \(-1\), and multiply to \(6\), not \(-6\). This option is clearly incorrect but might attract students who mistakenly look for positive factors.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \((x + 3)(x - 2)\), suggests numbers that add to \(1\), not \(-1\), and multiply to \(-6\), which is correct for the multiplication but not the addition. This could potentially confuse some students who get the multiplication right but mess up the addition.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle significantly with factorization. They might randomly select an option or choose based on superficial similarities. Option A (correct) might be chosen by a small percentage who have memorized or guessed correctly. Incorrect options might be chosen based on common misconceptions: B (5%), C (20%), D (20%), A (55%) - Note: These are speculative and based on the potential for significant misunderstanding.
  
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding and might start to apply basic factorization techniques. They are more likely to get it right or make systematic errors. So, A (60%), B (10%), C (15%), D (15%).

- **Proficient:** Proficient students should have a solid grasp of factorization techniques. The correct answer should be obvious: A (85%), B (5%), C (5%), D (5%).

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only know how to factorize but can also do it quickly and accurately. The expectation is a high percentage choosing the correct option: A (95%), B (2%), C (2%), D (1%).

Based on the analysis, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
