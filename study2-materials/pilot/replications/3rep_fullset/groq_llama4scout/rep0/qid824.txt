To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question.

The question requires students to understand what it means to count backwards in steps of 4 from a given number, 24,993. The correct answer can be found by subtracting 4 from 24,993.

## Step 1: Calculate the correct answer
To find the next number Amelie will say when counting backwards in steps of 4 from 24,993, we subtract 4 from 24,993.
24,993 - 4 = 24,989

## 2: Identify the correct option
Based on the calculation, the correct option is D) 24,989.

## 3: Analyze potential misconceptions and errors
- Option A (24,988) could be chosen by students who subtract 5 instead of 4.
- Option B (24,992) could be chosen by students who subtract 1 instead of 4.
- Option C (24,990) could be chosen by students who subtract 3 instead of 4.

## 4: Consider student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic subtraction or understanding the concept of counting backwards. They might choose any option randomly or based on a simple mistake like subtracting 1, 3, or 5 instead of 4. Given the simplicity of the numbers, errors might still be common.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are likely to understand the concept of subtracting 4 but could easily make a calculation error.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of arithmetic operations, including subtraction. They are less likely to make simple mistakes but might still fall into traps if the numbers or context suggest an alternative operation.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their arithmetic skills and less likely to make errors in straightforward calculations like this.

## 5: Estimate percentages based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (random or mistake), B=20% (subtracting 1), C=20% (subtracting 3), D=40% (correct or random guess)
- **Basic**: A=10% (significant mistake), B=10% (simple error), C=10% (another simple error), D=70% (correct understanding)
- **Proficient**: A=5% (unlikely mistake), B=5% (unlikely error), C=5% (minor error), D=85% (correct calculation)
- **Advanced**: A=1% (very unlikely mistake), B=1% (very unlikely error), C=1% (extremely minor error), D=97% (confident correct calculation)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%
