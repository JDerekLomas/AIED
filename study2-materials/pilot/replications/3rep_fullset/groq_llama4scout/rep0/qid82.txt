To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of which expression shows "\( x \) is greater than \( 9 \)", let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks to identify the correct mathematical expression that represents "\( x \) is greater than \( 9 \)". The correct answer is \( x > 9 \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
- A common misconception could be confusing the greater than (\( > \)) and less than (\( < \)) symbols, or misunderstanding the inclusion or exclusion of the equal sign (\( \leq \) or \( \geq \)).
- Option A (\( x < 9 \)) suggests \( x \) is less than 9, which is the opposite of what is asked.
- Option B (\( x \leq 9 \)) suggests \( x \) is less than or equal to 9, which also does not match.
- Option D (\( x \geq 9 \)) suggests \( x \) is greater than or equal to 9, which is close but includes 9.

## 3: Analyzing by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic inequalities. They might confuse \( > \) with \( < \) or not fully understand the meaning of \( > \) and \( \geq \). Therefore, they might choose A (\( x < 9 \)) because it's a straightforward but incorrect opposite, B (\( x \leq 9 \)) because they see the \( \leq \) and think it's somehow related to being greater, or D (\( x \geq 9 \)) because they see \( \geq \) and think it's close enough. C (\( x > 9 \)) might be chosen by those who have a basic understanding but are not confident.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of inequalities. They are less likely to confuse \( > \) and \( < \) but might still misunderstand the equal part. They are likely to choose C (\( x > 9 \)) if they've grasped the concept of greater than. However, some might still choose D (\( x \geq 9 \)) because the difference between \( > \) and \( \geq \) can be subtle.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of inequalities and are likely to choose C (\( x > 9 \)) as they understand the precise meaning of \( > \). Misconceptions are less likely here, but some might still choose D (\( x \geq 9 \)) due to a slip-up.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but are also adept at interpreting mathematical expressions accurately. They are highly likely to choose C (\( x > 9 \)) with minimal error.

## 4: Predicted Percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (common mistake of reversing the inequality), B=20% (misunderstanding of \( \leq \)), C=40% (basic understanding), D=10% (near miss).
- **Basic**: A=5% (unlikely to reverse), B=5% (unlikely but possible misunderstanding), C=80% (solid understanding), D=10% (subtle mistake).
- **Proficient**: A=1% (rare mistake), B=1% (rare), C=95% (strong understanding), D=3% (occasional slip).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no mistake), B=0% (no mistake), C=99% (excellent understanding), D=1% (very rare slip).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
proficient: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%
