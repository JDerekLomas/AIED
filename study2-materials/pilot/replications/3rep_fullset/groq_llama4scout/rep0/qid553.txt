To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question involves finding the value of one fraction card given the product of that card and another card with a known value. The known card is \( \frac{3}{7} \), and the product of the two cards is \( \frac{2}{5} \).

## Step 1: Understand the Mathematical Concept
The task requires dividing the product of the two fractions by the known fraction to find the unknown fraction. Mathematically, this can be represented as: \( \frac{3}{7} \times x = \frac{2}{5} \). Solving for \( x \) involves multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{7} \), which is \( \frac{7}{3} \). So, \( x = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{7}{3} \).

## 2: Solve for \( x \)
Calculating \( x \): \( x = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{7}{3} = \frac{2 \times 7}{5 \times 3} = \frac{14}{15} \).

## 3: Analyze the Difficulty of the Question
This question tests the student's ability to rearrange equations involving fractions and to perform multiplication of fractions. It's a straightforward application of mathematical concepts but requires attention to detail and the ability to apply inverse operations (in this case, division as multiplication by the reciprocal).

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with fraction multiplication and division. They might not correctly calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{7}{3} \) or might choose an answer that seems to relate to the numbers given but is not calculated correctly. Option B (\( \frac{14}{15} \)) seems likely to be chosen by a few as it's a direct calculation, but errors in calculation or conceptual misunderstanding could lead to other choices. However, given the direct nature of the calculation, even struggling students might stumble upon the correct answer or eliminate obviously incorrect ones.

- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to perform the calculation \( \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{7}{3} \) with some degree of accuracy. They are likely to get the correct answer, \( \frac{14}{15} \), which corresponds to option B.

- **Proficient:** These students should easily solve the problem and choose option B (\( \frac{14}{15} \)) as the correct answer. They have a solid understanding of fraction operations and are less likely to make calculation errors.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students will also quickly and accurately solve for \( x \) and select option B. Their strong mathematical foundation ensures they understand the concepts and can apply them correctly.

## 5: Estimate Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation:
- **Below Basic:** A=5% B=40% C=20% D=35% (Some might guess or incorrectly calculate, leading to a spread across options)
- **Basic:** A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10% (Most will get it right, some might make simple errors)
- **Proficient:** A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5% (High accuracy expected)
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0% (Expect 100% accuracy)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=5% B=40% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
