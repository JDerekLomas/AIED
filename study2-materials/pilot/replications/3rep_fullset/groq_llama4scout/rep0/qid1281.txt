To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the concepts involved.

The question tests the understanding of properties of arithmetic operations, specifically:
- Commutativity: \(a \times b = b \times a\)
- Associativity: \((a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)\)
- Distributivity: \(a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c\) or \(a(b + c) = ab + ac\), and in a more general form related to this question: \(a(b + c) = ab + ac\) can be rearranged or understood as \(a \times b + a \times c = a(b + c)\).

Given equation: \(7 \times 9 = 5 \times 9 + 2 \times 9\)

Let's rearrange and analyze:
\(7 \times 9 = (5 + 2) \times 9 = 5 \times 9 + 2 \times 9\)

This demonstrates the distributive property because \(7 = 5 + 2\), and thus \(7 \times 9\) is equal to \(5 \times 9 + 2 \times 9\), showing how multiplication distributes over addition.

## Step 1: Understanding the concepts
- The distributive property allows us to distribute a single operation (in this case, multiplication) over addition, as shown.
- Commutativity refers to the order of numbers being interchangeable.
- Associativity refers to how we group numbers in an operation.
- Factors refer to numbers that are multiplied together to get another number.

## 2: Analyzing the options
- A: Commutativity. This does not apply here because the order of multiplication is not being tested; rather, how multiplication relates to addition is being shown.
- B: Factors. This term does not describe a property of operations in the way the question suggests.
- C: Associativity. This property is about the grouping of operations, which is not what's being tested here.
- D: Distributivity. This property directly applies because the equation illustrates how multiplication can be distributed over addition.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the properties of arithmetic operations. They might confuse concepts or not recognize the distributive property. 
  - A (Commutativity): 20% (misconception or lack of understanding)
  - B (Factors): 10% (unrelated concept)
  - C (Associativity): 15% (confusing with another property)
  - D (Distributivity): 55% (some understanding, but could be lower due to confusion)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with nuances between properties.
  - A (Commutativity): 10%
  - B (Factors): 5%
  - C (Associativity): 10%
  - D (Distributivity): 75%

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of arithmetic properties and should easily identify distributivity.
  - A (Commutativity): 2%
  - B (Factors): 1%
  - C (Associativity): 2%
  - D (Distributivity): 95%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand but can apply and analyze properties deeply.
  - A (Commutativity): 1%
  - B (Factors): 0%
  - C (Associativity): 1%
  - D (Distributivity): 98%

The best answer is D. 

Below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=15% D=55%
Basic: A=10% B=5% C=10% D=75%
Proficient: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95%
Advanced: A=1% B=0% C=1% D=98%
