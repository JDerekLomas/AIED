To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing: the ability to understand the effect of adding or subtracting numbers in a compensatory manner, specifically in relation to adding 97. The correct method to add 97 to a number is to add 100 and then subtract 3, which corresponds to option B: \( +100 \) then \( -3 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question aims to identify a common misconception where students might not understand how to adjust their addition or subtraction to compensate for the numbers they're working with. Adding 97 can be tricky because it's close to 100, a round number that's easy to work with.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( +100 \) then \( +3 \) would actually add 103, not 97.
- Option B: \( +100 \) then \( -3 \) correctly adds 97.
- Option C: \( -100 \) then \( +3 \) would subtract 97, not add it.
- Option D: \( -100 \) then \( -3 \) would subtract 103.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
### Below Basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic addition and subtraction concepts and may not fully understand the compensatory strategies. They might choose options that seem to add or subtract in a straightforward manner without considering the compensation.
- A: 40% (thinking they are adding more)
- B: 20% (understanding the correct compensation)
- C: 20% (thinking they are subtracting but not understanding the addition)
- D: 20% (confused about subtraction)

### Basic
Students here have a grasp of basic arithmetic but might not always apply it correctly in context. They are more likely to recognize the need for compensation but might make mistakes.
- A: 30% (adds extra)
- B: 50% (correct approach)
- C: 15% (subtracts)
- D: 5% (double subtracts)

### Proficient
Proficient students understand arithmetic operations well and are likely to apply compensatory strategies correctly.
- A: 10% (incorrect addition)
- B: 80% (correct approach)
- C: 5% (subtracts 97)
- D: 5% (double subtracts)

### Advanced
Advanced students not only understand the arithmetic but can also apply it in more complex contexts efficiently. They are less likely to make mistakes on such a straightforward question.
- A: 5% (rare mistake)
- B: 90% (correct and efficient)
- C: 3% (unlikely mistake)
- D: 2% (very unlikely mistake)

## 4: Formatting the Response
Given the above analysis:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=50% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
