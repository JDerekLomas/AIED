## Step 1: Understand the question and the graph
The question presents a quadratic equation \(x^{2}+4x-1=-6\) and asks for the approximate solution using a graph of \(y = x^{2} + 4x - 1\). The equation can be rewritten as \(x^{2}+4x+5=0\).

## 2: Analyze the quadratic equation
To understand the potential solutions, we should analyze the quadratic equation \(x^{2}+4x+5=0\). This is a quadratic equation in the form of \(ax^{2}+bx+c=0\), where \(a=1\), \(b=4\), and \(c=5\).

## 3: Determine the discriminant
The discriminant, \(D\), of a quadratic equation is given by \(D = b^{2} - 4ac\). For the equation \(x^{2}+4x+5=0\), \(D = 4^{2} - 4(1)(5) = 16 - 20 = -4\). Since \(D < 0\), the equation has no real solutions.

## 4: Consider student understanding and potential misconceptions
Students might struggle with reading the graph or solving the quadratic equation. A common misconception could be not checking if the solutions are real or not, especially if they are used to solving equations with real roots.

## 5: Evaluate the answer choices
- A: \(x=4.25, \quad x=-0.25\)
- B: No real solutions
- C: \(x=-4.25, \quad x=0.25\)
- D: \(x=-1\)

Given the equation has no real solutions because the discriminant is negative, the correct answer is B.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand quadratic equations or how to interpret graphs. They might incorrectly solve the equation or misread the graph. Expect a high chance of incorrect solutions (A, C, D) and possibly some who say there are solutions without calculation.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the concept of solving quadratic equations but could struggle with the graph or calculating the discriminant. They might choose A or C if they mistakenly think the graph provides real roots or if they incorrectly solve the equation.
- **Proficient**: These students should understand how to solve quadratic equations and interpret graphs. They are likely to recognize the equation has no real solutions if they've calculated the discriminant or understand the graph doesn't intersect the x-axis at any point that solves the given equation.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to easily solve the problem, recognizing the equation \(x^{2}+4x+5=0\) has no real solutions due to its discriminant being negative.

## 7: Estimate percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (guessing or incorrect calculation), B=20% (some understanding of no real solutions), C=30% (another incorrect option), D=10% (single incorrect answer).
- **Basic**: A=30%, B=40%, C=25%, D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%

The best answer is B. 

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
