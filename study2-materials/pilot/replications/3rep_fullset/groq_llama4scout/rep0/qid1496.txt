## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a simple equation \(y = x^2\) and asks students to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 4\). The task is to replace the star (\(\bigstar\)) with the correct value of \(y\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception for students when dealing with equations like \(y = x^2\) is to mistakenly think that \(y = x \times 2\) (which would imply \(y = 2x\)), or to incorrectly apply operations. However, in this specific case, the equation is straightforward (\(y = x^2\)), and the only operation required is squaring \(x\).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
Given \(x = 4\), the correct calculation is \(y = 4^2 = 16\).
- Option A: \(8\) suggests a misunderstanding of the operation (possibly thinking \(4 \times 2 = 8\)).
- Option B: \(16\) is the correct answer based on \(4^2 = 16\).
- Option C: \(4\) implies a mistake where the student might think \(y = x\) or another incorrect operation.
- Option D: \(-16\) suggests an understanding of negative numbers but an incorrect application since \(4^2\) is always positive.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may struggle with basic algebraic concepts. They might not fully understand the concept of \(x^2\) or may confuse it with \(2x\). So, they could be more likely to choose A, C, or D due to a lack of understanding of squaring numbers. 
  - A: \(30\%\)
  - B: \(40\%\) (some might get it right by chance or basic understanding)
  - C: \(20\%\)
  - D: \(10\%\)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of algebra but might still make simple mistakes. They are more likely to understand \(y = x^2\) but could be tempted by incorrect options due to careless mistakes.
  - A: \(15\%\)
  - B: \(80\%\)
  - C: \(3\%\)
  - D: \(2\%\)

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts, including squaring numbers. They are less likely to make errors on simple questions like this.
  - A: \(5\%\)
  - B: \(92\%\)
  - C: \(2\%\)
  - D: \(1\%\)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand algebraic concepts but can also apply them in various contexts. They are highly unlikely to make mistakes on a straightforward question like this.
  - A: \(2\%\)
  - B: \(97\%\)
  - C: \(1\%\)
  - D: \(0\%\)
