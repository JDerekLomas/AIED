To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and evaluate their correctness based on the properties of algebra, specifically the distributive property.

The distributive property in algebra states that for any numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$. 

Tom says $a(b+c) \equiv (b+c) \times a$. This statement is correct because multiplication is commutative, meaning that the order of the factors does not change the product. Therefore, $(b+c) \times a = a(b+c)$.

Katie says $a(b+c) \equiv ab + c$. This statement is incorrect based on the distributive property. The correct expansion of $a(b+c)$ is $ab + ac$, not $ab + c$.

Given these explanations:

- Tom is correct because $a(b+c) = (b+c)a$ due to the commutative property of multiplication.
- Katie is incorrect because she omits the $a$ in the expansion.

So, the correct answer is that only Tom is correct.

Let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic concepts. They might not fully understand the distributive property or the commutative property of multiplication.
  - A (Only Tom): 20% (some might recognize Tom's correctness through intuition or partial understanding)
  - B (Only Katie): 10% (misunderstanding of algebraic properties)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 15% (lack of understanding of both properties)
  - D (Neither is correct): 55% (significant confusion or lack of knowledge)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors.
  - A (Only Tom): 50% (starting to grasp the commutative property)
  - B (Only Katie): 20% (some still confuse the distributive property)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 10% (beginning to differentiate between correct and incorrect applications)
  - D (Neither is correct): 20% (still some confusion)

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic properties.
  - A (Only Tom): 80% (clear understanding of both properties)
  - B (Only Katie): 5% (rarely, a proficient student might still hold a misconception)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 5% (unlikely, given their proficiency)
  - D (Neither is correct): 10% (unlikely, but possible due to over-cautiousness)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can apply and explain algebraic concepts deeply.
  - A (Only Tom): 95% (deep understanding of algebraic properties)
  - B (Only Katie): 0% (unlikely to hold such a misconception)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 0% (clear distinction between correct and incorrect statements)
  - D (Neither is correct): 5% (extremely rare, as they'd understand Tom's correctness and Katie's error)

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=15% D=55%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
