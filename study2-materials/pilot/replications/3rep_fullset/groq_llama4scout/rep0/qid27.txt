To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "If \( d=-2 \) what is the value of \( 10-2 d \) ?", let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties.

The question requires substituting \( d = -2 \) into the expression \( 10 - 2d \) and solving it. The correct solution is:
\[ 10 - 2(-2) = 10 + 4 = 14 \]

This corresponds to option C.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve incorrect handling of the negative sign in \( -2d \) when \( d = -2 \), leading to \( 10 - 2(-2) = 10 - (-4) = 10 - 4 = 6 \), which corresponds to option B. Another mistake could be not substituting \( d \) correctly or misinterpreting the operation with the negative number.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( -12 \) seems unlikely as it would require a significant miscalculation (\( 10 - 2(-2) = -12 \) implies \( 10 + 4 = -12 \), which is incorrect).
- Option B: \( 6 \) could be a result of a misconception where students think \( -2d \) becomes \( -2 \times -2 = 4 \) but then incorrectly apply it as \( 10 - 4 = 6 \).
- Option C: \( 14 \) is the correct answer.
- Option D: \( 32 \) seems highly unlikely as it would imply \( 10 - 2(-2) = 10 + 8 = 18 \) or a similar large error, not \( 32 \).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and substitution. They might incorrectly substitute \( d = -2 \) into \( 10 - 2d \) or misunderstand the operation, leading to a higher chance of selecting incorrect options. 
  - A: \( 20\% \) (significant error)
  - B: \( 40\% \) (misconception about negative numbers or substitution)
  - C: \( 20\% \) (correct, but struggling with the concept)
  - D: \( 20\% \) (large error, possibly from miscalculation)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebra but might still make simple mistakes.
  - A: \( 5\% \)
  - B: \( 30\% \) (common misconception)
  - C: \( 60\% \) (correct understanding, careful calculation)
  - D: \( 5\% \) (unlikely, but possible with significant miscalculation)

- **Proficient:** These students understand algebraic expressions and are less likely to make simple mistakes.
  - A: \( 1\% \)
  - B: \( 10\% \) (some might still fall into the misconception)
  - C: \( 85\% \) (accurate calculation)
  - D: \( 4\% \) (unlikely, but could happen with a severe miscalculation)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their algebraic manipulations.
  - A: \( 0\% \)
  - B: \( 2\% \)
  - C: \( 97\% \) (very confident in their calculations)
  - D: \( 1\% \) (extremely unlikely)

The best answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=30% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=1% B=10% C=85% D=4%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%
