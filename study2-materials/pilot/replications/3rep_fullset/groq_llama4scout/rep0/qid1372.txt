To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "What is \( 80 \% \) of \( 300 \)?", let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or errors students might make.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for \( 80 \% \) of \( 300 \). This is a straightforward percentage calculation: \( 80 \% \times 300 = 0.8 \times 300 = 240 \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions or Errors
- A common misconception could be confusing the percentage with the number or misapplying the percentage calculation.
- Another error might be adding or subtracting the percentage value from the original number instead of multiplying.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( 380 \) - This could result from adding \( 80 \% \) of \( 300 \) to \( 300 \) or another incorrect operation.
- B: \( 240 \) - This is the correct answer.
- C: \( 80 \) - This could result from mistakenly thinking \( 80 \% \) of \( 300 \) equals \( 80 \), possibly due to a misunderstanding of percentages.
- D: \( 24 \) - This might result from calculating \( 8 \% \) of \( 300 \) or a similar mistake.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic percentage calculations or misunderstand what \( 80 \% \) means. They might choose options based on simple addition/subtraction or incorrect multiplication.
- A: \( 20\% \) (some might mistakenly add)
- B: \( 40\% \) (those who have a basic understanding but might not calculate correctly)
- C: \( 25\% \) (misunderstanding of percentage)
- D: \( 15\% \) (incorrect calculation, like finding \( 8\% \) of \( 300 \))

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of percentages but might make calculation errors.
- A: \( 10\% \) 
- B: \( 70\% \) (most can calculate \( 80\% \) of \( 300 \) correctly)
- C: \( 15\% \) 
- D: \( 5\% \) 

### proficient
These students are confident in their calculations and understanding of percentages.
- A: \( 2\% \) 
- B: \( 90\% \) (accurately calculate \( 80\% \) of \( 300 \))
- C: \( 5\% \) 
- D: \( 3\% \) 

### advanced
Students at this level are not only proficient but can also apply their knowledge to complex problems. For a straightforward question like this, their performance would be high.
- A: \( 1\% \) 
- B: \( 95\% \) 
- C: \( 2\% \) 
- D: \( 2\% \) 

The best answer is B. 

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
