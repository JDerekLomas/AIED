To solve this, let's first understand Teddy's method for calculating \( 600 \div 25 \) and then apply it to \( 800 \div 25 \).

Teddy's method:
1. Recognize that there are \( 4 \) lots of \( 25 \) in \( 100 \).
2. Since \( 600 = 6 \times 100 \), he multiplies \( 4 \) (the number of lots of \( 25 \) in \( 100 \)) by \( 6 \) to get \( 24 \).

Applying this to \( 800 \div 25 \):
- \( 800 = 8 \times 100 \),
- There are still \( 4 \) lots of \( 25 \) in \( 100 \),
- So, he would multiply \( 4 \) by \( 8 \) to get \( 32 \).

Let's evaluate the options based on this understanding:

A: There are \( 4 \) lots of \( 25 \) in \( 100 \), then I multiplied \( 4 \) by \( 8 \), so the answer is \( 32 \). **This matches Teddy's method.**

B: There are \( 4 \) lots of \( 25 \) in \( 100 \), then I multiplied \( 8 \) by \( 6 \), so the answer is \( 48 \). **This does not match; it confuses the factors.**

C: There are \( 6 \) lots of \( 25 \) in \( 100 \), then I multiplied \( 6 \) by \( 4 \), so the answer is \( 24 \). **This is incorrect about the number of lots of \( 25 \) in \( 100 \) and doesn't apply to \( 800 \div 25 \).**

D: There are \( 8 \) lots of \( 25 \) in \( 100 \), then I multiplied \( 8 \) by \( 6 \), so the answer is \( 48 \). **This incorrectly states there are \( 8 \) lots of \( 25 \) in \( 100 \).**

Given the explanation, the correct answer is A. Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with division and multiplication facts. They might not fully understand Teddy's method or how to apply it.
  - A: \( 20\% \) (some might get it by luck or partial understanding)
  - B: \( 30\% \) (misunderstanding of the multiplication part)
  - C: \( 20\% \) (incorrect understanding of lots of \( 25 \) in \( 100 \))
  - D: \( 30\% \) (another incorrect understanding)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make procedural errors.
  - A: \( 60\% \) (understand and apply Teddy's method correctly)
  - B: \( 25\% \) (some confusion with factors)
  - C: \( 10\% \) (misunderstand the basic premise)
  - D: \( 5\% \) (significant misunderstanding)

- **Proficient:** Students with a solid grasp of the concepts should easily understand and apply Teddy's method.
  - A: \( 80\% \) (correct application of Teddy's method)
  - B: \( 15\% \) (some might confuse the operations)
  - C: \( 3\% \) (unlikely to misunderstand the basic fact)
  - D: \( 2\% \) (unlikely to make this error)

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand but can also analyze and apply methods accurately.
  - A: \( 95\% \) (clear understanding and correct application)
  - B: \( 3\% \) (unlikely to make a straightforward error)
  - C: \( 1\% \) (very unlikely to misunderstand)
  - D: \( 1\% \) (very unlikely to make this specific error)

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
