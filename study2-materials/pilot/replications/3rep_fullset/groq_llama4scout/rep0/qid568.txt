To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \frac{1}{7} \) of \( 56= \), let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions.

The question requires students to find one-seventh of 56, which is a straightforward calculation: \( \frac{1}{7} \times 56 = 8 \). This type of question tests basic fraction and multiplication skills.

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculation
The calculation \( \frac{1}{7} \) of \( 56 \) is \( 56 \div 7 = 8 \). This is a simple division problem that most students should find easy, as it doesn't require complex calculations or conceptual understanding beyond basic division and fractions.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the operation or misunderstanding fractions. For example, some students might incorrectly calculate \( \frac{1}{7} \) of \( 56 \) as \( 56 - 7 \) (which equals 49), or they might mistakenly think of it as \( 56 \div 6 \) or another incorrect operation.

## 3: Analyzing Each Option
- Option A: \( 7 \) could be a result of a miscalculation or incorrect rounding.
- Option B: \( 8 \) is the correct answer.
- Option C: \( 9 \) seems unrelated to a straightforward calculation of \( \frac{1}{7} \) of \( 56 \).
- Option D: \( 49 \) could result from \( 56 - 7 \), a subtraction error.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic division and fraction concepts. They might choose A, C, or D due to a lack of understanding or simple arithmetic errors. The correct answer, B, might be chosen by a smaller percentage. Prediction: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic arithmetic. They are less likely to make simple errors but might still fall into traps. The correct answer should be more frequently chosen. Prediction: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid understanding of fractions and division. They should easily identify the correct answer. Prediction: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students should not only know the calculation but also be able to reason about it. The correct answer should be nearly universally chosen. Prediction: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
