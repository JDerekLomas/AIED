## Step 1: Understand the question and the concept of reflection in the x-axis
The question asks for the new coordinates of point \( P \) after the triangle is reflected in the \( x \)-axis. Reflecting a point in the \( x \)-axis involves changing the sign of the \( y \)-coordinate while keeping the \( x \)-coordinate the same.

## 2: Identify the coordinates of point P and apply the reflection
Point \( P \) has coordinates \( (3, 1) \). When reflected in the \( x \)-axis, the new \( x \)-coordinate remains 3, but the \( y \)-coordinate changes to \( -1 \), resulting in new coordinates \( (3, -1) \).

## 3: Analyze the options given
- A: \( (3,1) \) - This is the original coordinate of \( P \), not the reflected coordinate.
- B: \( (3,0) \) - This suggests a change in the \( y \)-coordinate to 0, which is not correct for a reflection across the \( x \)-axis.
- C: \( (3,-1) \) - This is the correct coordinate after reflection across the \( x \)-axis.
- D: \( (1,3) \) - This suggests a swap and change of coordinates, which is incorrect for this type of reflection.

## 4: Consider the difficulty level and common misconceptions
- A common misconception might be not changing the sign of the \( y \)-coordinate (staying with \( (3,1) \)), or incorrectly adjusting both coordinates.
- The question is straightforward, testing the understanding of reflection across the \( x \)-axis.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option
- **Below Basic**: Students might not understand the concept of reflection or might confuse it with other transformations. They are likely to choose A (not reflecting at all) or D (swapping coordinates or random guess).
- **Basic**: Students understand basic transformations but might make simple errors. They are likely to choose A (no change) or B (incorrect adjustment).
- **Proficient**: Students understand the concept of reflection across the \( x \)-axis and are likely to choose C, but some might still choose A due to oversight.
- **Advanced**: Students are very confident in their understanding and are most likely to choose C.

## 6: Assign percentages based on predicted student responses
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (no change), B=20% (random incorrect adjustment), C=10% (correct but unlikely), D=10% (swap or incorrect transformation).
- **Basic**: A=40% (common mistake), B=30% (simple error), C=20% (correct), D=10% (incorrect transformation).
- **Proficient**: A=20% (overlook), B=10% (simple mistake), C=60% (correct), D=10% (incorrect transformation).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (rare oversight), B=0% (understanding is solid), C=90% (correct), D=5% (extremely rare mistake).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%
