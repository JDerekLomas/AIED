## Step 1: Understand the question
The question provides a rectangle with one side labeled as \(x\) and the other side labeled as \(x^2 + 9\). It states that the area of the rectangle is \(8 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\). The task is to determine which equation can be written from the given information.

## 2: Recall the formula for the area of a rectangle
The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula \(A = \text{length} \times \text{width}\). In this case, the area \(A = 8\), the length is \(x^2 + 9\), and the width is \(x\).

## 3: Write the equation based on the given information
Substituting the given values into the area formula gives \(8 = x(x^2 + 9)\).

## 4: Expand the equation
Expanding the equation yields \(8 = x^3 + 9x\).

## 5: Rearrange the equation to match the given options
Rearranging the equation to set it to 0 or to match the format of the given options, we get \(x^3 + 9x - 8 = 0\). However, to directly compare with the options provided, we note that \(x^3 + 9x = 8\).

## 6: Compare with the given options
Comparing the derived equation \(x^3 + 9x = 8\) with the options:
- A: \(x^{3}+9=8\) does not match because it's missing \(x\).
- B: \(x^{2}+x+9=8\) does not match because it incorrectly represents the area formula.
- C: \(2 x^{2}+2 x+18=8\) does not match as it incorrectly doubles the terms and adds constants.
- D: \(x^{3}+9 x=8\) directly matches our derived equation.

## 7: Analyze potential misconceptions and difficulty levels
- The question requires students to apply the area formula correctly and substitute the given expressions for length and width.
- Students need to be able to expand and rearrange equations, which might be challenging for those at lower ability levels.
- The correct answer, \(x^{3}+9 x=8\), is straightforward once the area formula is applied correctly.

## 8: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulation and applying formulas. They might incorrectly choose A or B due to misunderstanding the formula or not fully expanding the equation. A=30%, B=40%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra and formulas but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose B or A due to partial understanding. A=20%, B=50%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **proficient**: These students understand algebra and can apply formulas correctly. They are likely to get the correct answer but might be distracted by plausible incorrect options. A=10%, B=20%, C=10%, D=60%.
- **advanced**: Students at this level are confident in their algebraic manipulations and understanding of geometric formulas. They are likely to quickly identify the correct equation. A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
