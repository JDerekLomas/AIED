To approach this question, let's consider what makes a polygon regular: all sides must be of equal length, and all internal angles must be equal. A regular polygon that is a quadrilateral would therefore have to be a square, as it's the only quadrilateral where all sides are equal and all angles are right angles (90 degrees), making all angles equal.

- **Trapezium (A):** A trapezium has one pair of parallel sides but not all sides are equal, and not all angles are equal. So, it's not a regular polygon.
- **Rhombus (B):** A rhombus has all sides of equal length, but not all angles are equal (unless it's a square). So, it's not necessarily a regular polygon.
- **Rectangle (C):** A rectangle has opposite sides of equal length and all angles are right angles, but not all sides are equal (unless it's a square). So, it's not necessarily a regular polygon.
- **Square (D):** A square has all sides of equal length and all angles are right angles, making it both a regular polygon and a regular quadrilateral.

Given these definitions:

- Students at the **below_basic** level might struggle with the definitions of these shapes. They might think a regular polygon just means it looks "neat" or have misconceptions about what makes a shape regular. Therefore, they might incorrectly choose based on looks or partial understanding:
  - A=20% (some might think it's regular because it looks somewhat symmetrical)
  - B=30% (thinking all sides equal is enough)
  - C=20% (might think all right angles make it regular)
  - D=30% (correct, but might be by chance or correct understanding)

- Students at the **basic** level should have a better grasp of basic shapes but might still fall into traps:
  - A=10% (less likely to think trapezium is regular)
  - B=20% (know rhombus sides are equal but might not recall angle requirement)
  - C=15% (understand rectangle properties but know it's not all equal)
  - D=55% (most should identify square correctly)

- Students at the **proficient** level should clearly understand the definitions:
  - A=5%
  - B=10%
  - C=5%
  - D=80%

- Students at the **advanced** level should have a strong understanding and be able to apply it accurately:
  - A=0% (or close, as they know trapezium isn't regular)
  - B=0% (or minimal, as they understand rhombus isn't necessarily regular)
  - C=0% (or minimal, as they know rectangle isn't regular unless a square)
  - D=100% (or very close, as they accurately identify square as regular)

So, 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
