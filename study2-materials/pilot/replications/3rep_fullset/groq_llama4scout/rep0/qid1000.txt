To approach this question, let's first understand the algebraic concept involved and then consider the potential pitfalls or simplifications that students at different ability levels might encounter.

The expression given is \( \frac{1-t}{t-1} \). A common misconception or a step that students might take is to try to simplify this by canceling out terms directly without considering the signs or the relationship between the numerator and the denominator.

## Step 1: Factor and Simplify
Notice that \( 1 - t = -(t - 1) \). Therefore, \( \frac{1-t}{t-1} = \frac{-(t-1)}{t-1} \). For \( t \neq 1 \), this simplifies to \( -1 \) because the \( (t-1) \) terms cancel out.

## 2: Consider Student Misconceptions
- A common error could be to simplify directly to \( 1 \) (option C) without considering the negative sign, which would be a mistake.
- Another error could be not recognizing that the expression simplifies at all, leading to choosing "Does not simplify" (option D), though this is less likely given the straightforward nature of the cancellation.
- Some might incorrectly simplify to \( t \) (option A), which seems unlikely as it doesn't directly follow from common algebraic mistakes.
- The correct simplification, \( -1 \) (option B), requires recognizing the relationship between \( 1-t \) and \( t-1 \).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly simplify or not simplify at all. Expect a high percentage to choose \( C = 1 \) (around 40-50%) because they might overlook the negative sign or not know how to proceed. Some might choose \( D = Does\ not\ simplify \) (around 20-30%), and fewer might choose \( A = t \) or \( B = -1 \).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a better grasp of algebra but might still make careless mistakes. They might be more likely to choose \( B = -1 \) (around 50-60%) if they correctly identify the relationship between \( 1-t \) and \( t-1 \), but some could still choose \( C = 1 \) (around 20-30%) or \( D = Does\ not\ simplify \) (around 10-20%).
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to choose \( B = -1 \) (around 80-90%) as they understand the algebra well and can correctly simplify the expression. Few would choose \( C = 1 \) or \( D = Does\ not\ simplify \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level would almost certainly choose \( B = -1 \) (around 95-100%), as they have a strong understanding of algebra and can quickly simplify the given expression.

## 4: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis, here are the predicted percentages:

- **below_basic**: A=10% B=20% C=50% D=20%
- **basic**: A=10% B=55% C=25% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=50% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=55% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
