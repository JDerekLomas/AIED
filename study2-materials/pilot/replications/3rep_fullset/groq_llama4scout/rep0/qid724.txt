To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and the nature of the task. The question involves reflecting a point across a given line, in this case, the line \(y = 1\). The point \(P\) is at coordinates \((3, 3)\).

## Reflection Across a Horizontal Line
When reflecting a point across a horizontal line (in this case, \(y = 1\)), the \(x\)-coordinate remains the same, but the \(y\)-coordinate changes. The distance of the point from the line of reflection is preserved but on the opposite side.

## Calculating the New Coordinates
The original \(y\)-coordinate of \(P\) is \(3\). The line of reflection is \(y = 1\). The distance from \(P\) to the line \(y = 1\) is \(3 - 1 = 2\). To reflect \(P\) across \(y = 1\), we go the same distance below \(y = 1\), so the new \(y\)-coordinate is \(1 - 2 = -1\).

## Predicting Student Responses
- The correct answer, given the reflection across \(y = 1\), is \((3, -1)\), which corresponds to option C.

## Ability Levels and Predicted Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding coordinates, reflections, or both. They might not accurately calculate the reflection or could choose an answer based on a misunderstanding of the transformation. A significant proportion might choose A (no change) because they don't understand the concept of reflection or think the point doesn't move. Some might randomly select an option.
  - **A=40%** (thinking point doesn't move or misunderstanding reflection)
  - **B=20%** (random or incorrect calculation)
  - **C=20%** (correct calculation, understanding of reflection)
  - **D=20%** (incorrect calculation or misunderstanding)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple errors in calculation or understanding the concept of reflection across a line not parallel to the axes.
  - **A=20%** (misunderstanding or not applying reflection correctly)
  - **B=10%** (miscalculation)
  - **C=60%** (correct understanding and application)
  - **D=10%** (incorrect calculation)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept of reflection and can apply it correctly. Errors would be minimal.
  - **A=5%** (careless mistake or misunderstanding)
  - **B=5%** (miscalculation)
  - **C=85%** (correct application)
  - **D=5%** (miscalculation)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also apply it accurately and quickly. Errors are likely to be very minimal.
  - **A=0%** (unlikely to misunderstand)
  - **B=0%** (unlikely to miscalculate)
  - **C=95%** (accurate application)
  - **D=5%** (potential for a very careless mistake)

The best answer is C. 

Given the analysis:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
