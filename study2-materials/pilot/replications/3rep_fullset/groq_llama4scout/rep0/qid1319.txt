To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required for each option.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks which sequence always produces consecutive numbers if \( n \) is a positive integer. Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow each other in order by the same difference, which in the simplest case, is 1.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A: \( n, n+1, n+2 \). This sequence inherently consists of consecutive numbers because the difference between \( n \) and \( n+1 \) is 1, and between \( n+1 \) and \( n+2 \) is also 1.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B: \( n, 2n, 3n \). This sequence does not consist of consecutive numbers unless \( n = 1 \) or \( n = 0 \), but since \( n \) must be a positive integer, \( n = 0 \) is excluded. For \( n > 1 \), the differences between \( n \) and \( 2n \) and between \( 2n \) and \( 3n \) are \( n \) and \( n \) respectively, not 1.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C: \( 3n, 2n, n \). This sequence does not consist of consecutive numbers because the differences between \( 3n \) and \( 2n \) and between \( 2n \) and \( n \) are \( n \) and \( n \) respectively, which is not a constant difference of 1.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D: \( n, n+2, n+4 \). This sequence consists of numbers that are 2 apart, not consecutive numbers, because the difference between \( n \) and \( n+2 \) and between \( n+2 \) and \( n+4 \) is 2.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding what consecutive numbers are or applying the concept to the given sequences. They might mistakenly choose sequences that look like they could be consecutive or are familiar. Option A seems straightforward, but without a deep understanding, they might be drawn to sequences that seem "simple" or familiar. Guessing might play a significant role here. A=60% (because it's intuitively correct), B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of numbers and sequences. They should recognize that consecutive numbers have a difference of 1. Option A should be clearly identifiable as correct. A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand consecutive numbers and can apply this to sequences. They should easily identify Option A as correct and dismiss the others. A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concept but can also quickly evaluate sequences. They should have no trouble identifying Option A as the correct answer. A=99%, B=1%, C=0%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
