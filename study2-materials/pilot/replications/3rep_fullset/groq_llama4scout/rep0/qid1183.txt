To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions related to multiplying negative numbers and the general understanding of multiplication.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception among students when multiplying negative numbers is forgetting the rule that two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive result, and a negative number multiplied by a positive number give a negative result. However, the question here specifically tests the multiplication of a positive number by a negative number.

## 2: Analyzing the Question
The question \(5 \times (-4) =\) is straightforward in terms of required mathematical operation: multiplying a positive number by a negative number. The correct answer, according to mathematical rules, is \(-20\) because multiplying a positive number by a negative number yields a negative result.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the rules of multiplying positive and negative numbers. They might incorrectly add or subtract the numbers or misunderstand the sign. Option A (\(-9\)) could be a result of \(-4 - 5\) or similar incorrect operations. Option C (\(20\)) might result from ignoring the negative sign. Option B (\(9\)) seems less likely as it doesn't directly relate to a common error in multiplication or addition/subtraction of the numbers given. Option D (\(-20\)) is the correct answer.

## 4: Estimating Percentages for Below Basic
Given the potential for confusion, below_basic: A=20% B=5% C=30% D=45%.

## 5: Basic Level
At the basic level, students have a grasp of multiplication and are learning about negative numbers. They might still make mistakes with the signs. The correct operation is understood, but applying it correctly might not be consistent. So, incorrect options might still be chosen, but with a better understanding than below basic.

## 6: Estimating Percentages for Basic
basic: A=10% B=5% C=15% D=70%.

## 7: Proficient Level
Proficient students have a solid understanding of multiplication with negative numbers. They should consistently choose the correct answer without much confusion.

## 8: Estimating Percentages for Proficient
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=3% D=90%.

## 9: Advanced Level
Advanced students not only know the rules but can apply them in complex situations. For a straightforward question like this, they would almost certainly choose the correct answer.

## 10: Estimating Percentages for Advanced
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=5% C=30% D=45%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=15% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=3% D=90%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%
