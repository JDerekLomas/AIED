## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for constructing a triangle with specific side length and angles.

## 2: Analyze the question
The question asks to construct a triangle with a side length of \( 7 \mathrm{~cm} \) and angles of \( 40^{\degree} \) and \( 50^{\degree} \) on either side of this side. The correct method involves using a protractor to measure angles and ensuring the side lengths and angles match the given criteria.

## 3: Evaluate option A
Option A describes drawing a line \( 7 \mathrm{~cm} \) long, measuring \( 40^{\degree} \) from one end, and then drawing a \( 50 \mathrm{~cm} \) line from the same end through the marked angle. This option incorrectly suggests drawing a \( 50 \mathrm{~cm} \) line without considering the triangle's properties or the given side length as a fixed side.

## 4: Evaluate option B
Option B suggests using a compass to draw arcs with widths of \( 40 \mathrm{~cm} \) and \( 50 \mathrm{~cm} \) from each end of the \( 7 \mathrm{~cm} \) line. This method does not directly relate to constructing a triangle with given angles and a side.

## 5: Evaluate option C
Option C involves drawing a \( 7 \mathrm{~cm} \) line, measuring \( 40^{\degree} \) and \( 50^{\degree} \) from the same end, and then drawing lines through these points. This method incorrectly uses the same endpoint for both angle measurements.

## 6: Evaluate option D
Option D suggests drawing a \( 7 \mathrm{~cm} \) line, measuring \( 40^{\degree} \) from one end and \( 50^{\degree} \) from the other end, and then drawing lines through these points to complete the triangle. This is the correct method as it accurately reflects how to construct a triangle with given angles and a side.

## 7: Consider student errors and understanding
- Students at the below_basic level might struggle with understanding geometric constructions and could be misled by options that seem to follow a logical sequence but are incorrect.
- Basic students might have a foundational understanding but could still make mistakes, especially if they misunderstand how to apply geometric principles.
- Proficient students would likely understand the correct method and recognize incorrect options.
- Advanced students would not only know the correct method but also understand why other options are incorrect.

## 8: Predict student responses
Given the analysis:
- **Below_basic**: Might choose A (20%) due to its straightforward steps, B (30%) for its use of a compass, C (20%) for measuring angles from one point, and D (30%) if they somehow understand the correct angle placement.
- **Basic**: A (15%) for its simplicity, B (10%) as it's not directly relevant, C (25%) due to confusion with angle measurements, and D (50%) as they grasp the basic construction.
- **Proficient**: A (5%) for being clearly incorrect, B (5%) for not applying, C (10%) for misunderstanding angle placement, and D (80%) for accurately describing the construction.
- **Advanced**: A (0%) for obvious incorrectness, B (0%) for irrelevance, C (5%) for a potential minor mistake, and D (95%) for precise knowledge.

## 9: Finalize predictions
Based on typical student understanding and common misconceptions:
- **below_basic**: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
- **basic**: A=10% B=5% C=20% D=65%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=0% C=10% D=85%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=20% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=10% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
