## Step 1: Understand the question and the options provided
The question asks for the correct second step to express the given expression as a single fraction. The expression given is \(\frac{9}{x+3} - \frac{2}{x}\), and the first step provided is \(\frac{9x}{x(x+3)} - \frac{2(x+3)}{x(x+3)}\). The task is to identify the correct next step from the options provided.

## 2: Analyze the correct process
To combine these fractions into a single fraction, the next step after finding a common denominator (which has been done) is to subtract the numerators while keeping the common denominator. So, the correct second step should be: \(\frac{9x - 2(x+3)}{x(x+3)}\).

## 3: Evaluate each option
- Option A: \(\frac{9x - 2(x+3)}{x(x+3)}\) matches the correct process for combining the fractions.
- Option B: \(\frac{9}{3} - \frac{2(3)}{3}\) seems to substitute \(x = 3\) into the original equation rather than continuing the algebraic manipulation.
- Option C: \(\frac{9}{x+3} - \frac{2}{x}\) is the original expression, not a step towards combining it into a single fraction.
- Option D: \(\frac{9x - 2(x+3)}{x(x+3) - x(x+3)}\) incorrectly alters the denominator.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and fraction operations. They might choose B because it seems like an evaluation of the expression at a specific value, or C because it looks familiar. Option D might appeal due to a misconception about how to handle the denominator. A=20% (those who somehow managed to get it right), B=30% (misinterpreting the task), C=30% (not advancing), D=20% (incorrectly adjusting the denominator).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basics but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose A=60% (correct), B=20% (some confusion), C=10% (staying with the original), D=10% (incorrect denominator adjustment).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the process well. A=90% (correct), B=5% (minor errors), C=3% (unlikely to revert), D=2% (clear mistake).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident and accurate. A=98% (correct), B=1% (rare mistake), C=0.5% (extremely unlikely), D=0.5% (clear error).

## 5: Assign percentages
Based on the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **Advanced**: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
