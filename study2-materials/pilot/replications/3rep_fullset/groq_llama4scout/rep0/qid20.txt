## Step 1: Understand the question and the content it tests
The question tests the formula for the volume of a cuboid, which is \( \text{volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \). Given the volume is \( 30 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \), the height is \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \), and the depth (which we can consider as the width) is \( 2 \mathrm{~cm} \), we need to find the length (labelled with a star). The formula can be rearranged to find the width: \( \text{width} = \frac{\text{volume}}{\text{length} \times \text{height}} \).

## 2: Solve the problem to find the correct answer
Substitute the given values into the formula: \( 30 = \text{star} \times 2 \times 3 \). Solving for the star: \( 30 = 6 \times \text{star} \), thus \( \text{star} = \frac{30}{6} = 5 \mathrm{~cm} \). So, the correct answer is B) \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 3: Analyze the potential for misconceptions or errors
The main potential error here could be misunderstanding the formula or miscalculating. However, given that the numbers are straightforward and the question directly tests the application of the volume formula, most students who understand the concept should be able to get it right.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with the formula or simple division. They might choose randomly or based on a common misconception. Option D seems out of scale and less likely to be chosen by those who understand the basic scale of measurements. A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic**: Students at this level should grasp the basic concept of volume and be able to perform simple calculations. They might still make errors in calculation or in applying the formula. B=60% A=20% C=10% D=10%
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to understand the concept well and apply it accurately. They should mostly choose B, with small chances of calculation errors leading to other options. A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but are also less likely to make simple arithmetic errors. They should nearly all choose B. A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%

## 5: Translate predictions into the required format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
