To approach this question, let's analyze the expression given and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The expression to simplify is \( \frac{t^{2}+2 t+1}{t+1} \). Notice that \( t^{2}+2 t+1 \) can be factored as \( (t+1)^{2} \). Therefore, the expression simplifies to \( \frac{(t+1)^{2}}{t+1} \), which further simplifies to \( t+1 \) for all \( t \neq -1 \) (since \( t = -1 \) would make the denominator zero).

## Step 1: Understanding the Expression
The given expression can be simplified by recognizing that \( t^{2}+2t+1 = (t+1)^2 \). Thus, \( \frac{t^{2}+2 t+1}{t+1} = \frac{(t+1)^2}{t+1} = t+1 \), for \( t \neq -1 \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be failing to factor \( t^{2}+2t+1 \) correctly or not canceling out the common factor \( (t+1) \) from the numerator and denominator. Another potential issue could be students not realizing that \( t = -1 \) is not in the domain of the original expression but does not affect the simplification process for \( t \neq -1 \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( t+2 \) seems incorrect as there's no \( +1 \) to distribute or add.
- Option B: \( t+1 \) matches our simplification.
- Option C: \( t^{2}+t \) does not match any standard simplification of the given expression.
- Option D: \( \text{Does not simplify} \) is incorrect since the expression does simplify to \( t+1 \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with factoring and simplifying expressions. They may not recognize \( t^{2}+2t+1 \) as \( (t+1)^2 \) or may not know how to simplify the fraction. Thus, they might choose \( \text{Does not simplify} \) (D) or make a random choice. \( A=10\% \), \( B=20\% \), \( C=20\% \), \( D=50\% \).
- **Basic:** Students here have some understanding but might still struggle with the factoring or the concept of canceling out terms. They might incorrectly simplify or choose an option that doesn't make sense. \( A=15\% \), \( B=60\% \), \( C=15\% \), \( D=10\% \).
- **Proficient:** These students should be able to factor \( t^{2}+2t+1 \) and simplify the fraction. They are likely to choose \( B: t+1 \). \( A=5\% \), \( B=85\% \), \( C=5\% \), \( D=5\% \).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should have a strong grasp of algebraic manipulation and be able to simplify the expression easily. They are likely to choose \( B: t+1 \) with high confidence. \( A=0\% \), \( B=95\% \), \( C=0\% \), \( D=5\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=20% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
