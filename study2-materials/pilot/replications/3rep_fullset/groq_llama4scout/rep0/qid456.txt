To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question.

The question requires students to identify an arithmetic sequence, which is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between any two successive members is a constant. For Tom's sequence: \(5, 8, 11, 14, 17, \ldots\), the common difference is \(3\). For Katie's sequence: \(5, 15, 45, 135, 405, \ldots\), the differences between successive terms are \(10, 30, 90, 270, \ldots\), which are not constant.

## Step 1: Understanding the Sequences
Tom's sequence is clearly an arithmetic sequence because each term increases by \(3\). Katie's sequence, however, is a geometric sequence because each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by \(3\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to confuse arithmetic sequences with geometric sequences or to not fully understand the definition of an arithmetic sequence. However, the question is quite straightforward in distinguishing between the two types of sequences.

## 3: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding what constitutes an arithmetic sequence. They might confuse it with a geometric sequence or not recognize either sequence correctly. Given the clarity of the question, however, most might still be able to see Tom's sequence as correct but could be misled into thinking Katie's could also be arithmetic, or they might not understand the concept well enough to identify either correctly.

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of arithmetic and geometric sequences. They should easily identify Tom's sequence as arithmetic. Katie's sequence, with its multiplying pattern, should also be recognizable as not arithmetic but geometric. Thus, they should mostly choose A) Only Tom.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students have a solid grasp of sequence definitions. They will easily identify Tom's sequence and correctly reject Katie's as arithmetic. They understand the definitions well and can apply them accurately.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the concepts but can also analyze sequences quickly and accurately. They will have no trouble identifying Tom's sequence as arithmetic and Katie's as geometric.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given the straightforward nature of the sequences provided:
- **Below Basic:** A=70% (recognize Tom's sequence), B=15% (might mistakenly think only Katie's), C=5% (unlikely to see both), D=10% (not recognizing either).
- **Basic:** A=85%, B=5%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.
- **Advanced:** A=99%, B=0.5%, C=0.5%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
basic: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.5% D=0%
