## Step 1: Understanding the Quadratic Formula
The quadratic formula is given by \(h = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are coefficients from the quadratic equation \(ah^2 + bh + c = 0\). For Vera's equation \(3h^2 - 10h + 4 = 0\), \(a = 3\), \(b = -10\), and \(c = 4\).

## 2: Applying the Quadratic Formula to the Given Equation
Substituting \(a = 3\), \(b = -10\), and \(c = 4\) into the quadratic formula gives \(h = \frac{-(-10) \pm \sqrt{(-10)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 4}}{2 \cdot 3}\). Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the formula yields \(h = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 - 48}}{6}\), which further simplifies to \(h = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{52}}{6}\).

## 3: Identifying the Components of the Quadratic Formula
The part of the formula that needs to be filled in is \(\frac{? \pm \sqrt{?-?}}{\bigcirc}\). From the given equation and the quadratic formula, we can see that:
- The \(?\) in \(? \pm \sqrt{?-?}\) corresponds to \(b = -10\), but since it's \(10\) (because of \(-(-10)\)) and it's under the square root that \(b^2\) and \(4ac\) are considered, so we focus on the values inside the square root and the denominator.
- \(b^2 = 100\) and \(4ac = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 48\), so \(?-?\) corresponds to \(100 - 48\).
- The \(\bigcirc\) corresponds to \(2a = 2 \cdot 3 = 6\).

## 4: Evaluating the Options
Given the quadratic formula application:
- The denominator \(\bigcirc\) should be \(6\), which corresponds to option D.
- The \(100 - 48 = 52\), and \(b = 10\) (since \(-b\) becomes \(+10\)), so we are looking for an option that matches the denominator or the structure.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the quadratic formula itself. They might not correctly identify \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\), or they might confuse the parts of the formula. They are likely to choose incorrectly across the board.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of the formula but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They might correctly identify \(2a = 6\) but struggle with what's under the square root or simply misread the question.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the quadratic formula and can apply it. They should recognize that the denominator is \(6\) (option D) and might correctly infer or calculate the other parts.
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the formula but can also apply it accurately and quickly. They will likely choose the correct option without hesitation.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of identifying \(2a = 6\) for the denominator:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40% (guessing or partially correct understanding)
- **Basic:** A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60% (better understanding but possible mistakes)
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80% (clear understanding, some minor errors)
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100% (accurate and confident)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
