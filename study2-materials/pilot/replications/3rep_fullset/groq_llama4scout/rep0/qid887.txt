To approach this question, let's analyze the mathematical concepts involved and the potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question revolves around the concept of powers and exponents, specifically checking if students can evaluate and compare expressions with different bases but the same or different exponents.

## Step 1: Understanding the Claims
Tom claims \(2^{6} = 4^{3}\), and Katie claims \(2^{6} = 8^{2}\). To assess who is correct, we need to evaluate each claim.

## 2: Evaluating Tom's Claim
For Tom's claim: \(2^{6} = 64\) and \(4^{3} = (2^{2})^{3} = 2^{6} = 64\). So, Tom is correct.

## 3: Evaluating Katie's Claim
For Katie's claim: \(2^{6} = 64\) and \(8^{2} = (2^{3})^{2} = 2^{6} = 64\). So, Katie is also correct.

## 4: Analyzing Potential Student Errors
- A common misconception might involve not applying exponent rules correctly, such as mistakenly adding exponents instead of multiplying them when dealing with powers of powers.
- Another error could be misinterpreting the base and exponent, especially if students are not confident in converting between different bases.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic exponent rules and converting between bases. They might not correctly evaluate \(4^{3}\) or \(8^{2}\) in terms of base 2, leading to a higher chance of selecting D) Neither is correct, as they might not understand how to compare these values properly. A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in applying rules, especially if they don't recognize \(4 = 2^{2}\) and \(8 = 2^{3}\). They are more likely to evaluate expressions directly but might still struggle with the conceptual application. A=15% B=10% C=50% D=25%
- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to understand and apply exponent rules correctly. They should recognize both \(4^{3} = (2^{2})^{3} = 2^{6}\) and \(8^{2} = (2^{3})^{2} = 2^{6}\), making them likely to choose C) Both Tom and Katie. A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of the concepts and apply them accurately. They should easily see that both Tom and Katie are correct, reinforcing the choice of C. A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=50% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
