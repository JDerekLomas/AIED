To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the problem and the common misconceptions associated with ratio problems.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question involves sharing money in a given ratio and finding out how much one person gets when the other person's share is known. The ratio given is \(5:4\), and Tom gets \(£180\).

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception in ratio problems is not understanding that the ratio represents a comparison of parts, not the actual amounts directly. Students might mistakenly try to apply the ratio directly to the given amount without finding the value of one part of the ratio.

## 3: Solving the Question Correctly
To solve it correctly, first, find the total parts in the ratio which is \(5 + 4 = 9\) parts. If Tom gets \(£180\) for his 5 parts, then 1 part is worth \(£180 / 5 = £36\). Therefore, his brother's 4 parts would be \(4 \times £36 = £144\).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
- **Direct Proportion Error**: Some students might incorrectly assume that since Tom gets \(£180\), and his share is 5 parts, they directly calculate without finding the worth of one part.
- **Misapplication of Ratio**: Others might add or subtract the ratio numbers incorrectly or not at all, leading to incorrect calculations.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students might struggle with basic ratio concepts. They could incorrectly assume Tom's \(£180\) is directly related to his ratio without calculation, or they might pick an answer without calculation. **A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%**
- **Basic**: Students here might understand ratios but struggle with applying them to find actual values. They might calculate but make errors. The correct answer, \(£144\), might be chosen by those who understand ratios well enough. **A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%**
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand ratios well and apply them correctly. They should mostly choose \(£144\). **A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%**
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of ratios and proportions. They would likely solve this without issue. **A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
