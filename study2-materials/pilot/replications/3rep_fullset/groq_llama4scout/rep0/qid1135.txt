## Step1: Understand the equation and the task
The equation given is $y = 6 - x$. The task is to find the value of $x$ when $y = 8$ and complete the table of values.

## 2: Solve for $x$ when $y = 8$
To find $x$, we substitute $y = 8$ into the equation $y = 6 - x$, which gives $8 = 6 - x$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 6 - 8 = -2$.

## 3: Analyze the question for potential misconceptions or traps
The question requires substituting a given $y$ value into the equation to solve for $x$. This is a straightforward substitution and solving process. However, students might make errors if they incorrectly manipulate the equation or substitute values incorrectly.

## 4: Consider student errors at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and could easily make mistakes in rearranging the equation or substituting values. They might not even attempt to solve for $x$ or could get the signs wrong.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to perform simple algebraic operations but might still make careless mistakes, such as incorrectly solving the equation $8 = 6 - x$ to get $x = 8 - 6 = 2$ (which is a common error if not paying attention to the subtraction).
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are expected to handle algebraic equations confidently. They should easily solve $8 = 6 - x$ to find $x = -2$ with minimal chance of error.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebra and are less likely to make errors in solving simple equations like $y = 6 - x$ for $x$.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the correct answer is $x = -2$:
- **Below Basic**: A=10% (might guess or make a random error), B=20% (could miscalculate and think $x$ is positive and large), C=40% (common mistake of $x = 2$), D=30% (some might get it right by chance or have a vague recall).
- **Basic**: A=5% (less likely to make a large error), B=10% (miscalculation), C=20% (thinking $x=2$), D=65% (most should get it right).
- **Proficient**: A=2% (very unlikely error), B=5% (rare miscalculation), C=5% (occasional lapse), D=88% (should consistently get it right).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no chance of such an error), B=0% (unlikely), C=0% (unlikely), D=100% (should all get it right).

## 6: Convert predictions into the required format
Below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
Basic: A=5% B=10% C=20% D=65%
Proficient: A=2% B=5% C=5% D=88%
Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=20% D=65%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=5% D=88%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
