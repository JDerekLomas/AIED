## Step 1: Understand the question and the compound shape
The question presents a compound shape made of two rectangles with various sides labelled: \( p \) cm (in red), 15 cm, 12 cm, 7 cm, and 7 cm. One side is unlabelled. The task is to find the value of \( p \).

## 2: Identify the relevant information for solving the problem
To find \( p \), we need to understand the geometric relationships. Since the shape is made of rectangles, opposite sides of each rectangle are equal in length.

## 3: Analyze the given lengths and their implications
Given lengths are 15 cm, 12 cm, 7 cm, and 7 cm. The side labelled \( p \) is part of one of the rectangles, and there's an unlabelled side which we need to figure out to solve for \( p \).

## 4: Determine the relationship to solve for \( p \)
The two rectangles share a side of 7 cm. One rectangle has sides 7 cm and 15 cm, and the other has sides 12 cm and \( p \) cm. For these rectangles to fit together as described, the 7 cm side must align with one of the sides of the other rectangle, and the 15 cm side must align with the \( p \) and 12 cm sides in a way that makes geometric sense.

## 5: Solve for \( p \)
Since one rectangle has a side of 15 cm and the other a side of 12 cm, and they share a 7 cm side, \( p \) must make the other sides match up. The total length on one axis is 7 cm + 7 cm = 14 cm is not relevant here as we compare sides of rectangles directly. Given that 15 cm is one side, and if 12 cm and \( p \) are the other sides of their respective rectangles, \( p \) should equal 15 - 7 = 8 cm or simply match the configuration given. However, noticing the lengths given and typical geometric constructions, if 7 cm and \( p \) are to match with 12 cm and 15 cm in a compound figure, and assuming a straightforward configuration where sides align directly: if one side is 12 cm and the adjacent side (shared or not) is 7 cm, \( p \) would relate directly to completing the rectangle with 15 cm.

## 6: Direct calculation
The total length of the combined shape in one dimension is 15 cm, with one part being 12 cm and the other part being \( p \), and there's a 7 cm segment on each side. So, if 7 cm + \( p \) = 12 cm (considering the configuration where \( p \) and 7 cm are adjacent to 12 cm), then \( p = 12 - 7 = 5 \) cm.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic geometric concepts and calculations. They might not understand how to use given lengths to find \( p \) or might miscalculate. Option D (Not enough information) could be tempting if they don't see how to calculate \( p \), but given the straightforward nature of the calculation, they might also guess or incorrectly calculate. \( A = 30\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 30\% \).
- **Basic:** Basic level students should be able to understand the geometric setup but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are likely to attempt a calculation. \( A = 50\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 20\% \).
- **Proficient:** Proficient students will likely solve it correctly with minimal chance of error in calculation or conceptual understanding. \( A = 80\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will almost certainly solve it correctly and quickly, with little to no errors. \( A = 95\% \), \( B = 3\% \), \( C = 1\% \), \( D = 1\% \).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
