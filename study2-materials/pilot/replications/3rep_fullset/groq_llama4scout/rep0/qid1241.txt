To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and the actual solving process for the given quadratic equation \(x^{2} + 4x = 0\).

## Step 1: Solve the Equation
The equation can be solved by factoring out \(x\), which gives \(x(x + 4) = 0\). This yields two solutions: \(x = 0\) and \(x = -4\).

## 2: Evaluate Tom's Claim
Tom claims one solution is \(x = 2\). However, substituting \(x = 2\) into the equation results in \(2^{2} + 4(2) = 4 + 8 = 12\), which does not equal 0. So, Tom is incorrect.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's Claim
Katie claims one solution is \(x = 0\). Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation gives \(0^{2} + 4(0) = 0\), which confirms that \(x = 0\) is indeed a solution. So, Katie is correct.

## 4: Analyze the Misconception
The misconception here could be students not fully factoring the quadratic equation or not checking solutions properly. However, the question does not require solving the equation fully but rather identifying who is correct based on their claims.

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand how to solve quadratic equations or might not know how to factor. They might guess or not fully evaluate the claims. Given Tom's and Katie's claims, a significant portion might think Tom is correct due to a lack of understanding (\(A = 30\%\)), a substantial portion might recognize Katie's correctness (\(B = 40\%\)), a smaller portion might think both are correct due to confusion (\(C = 15\%\)), and a small portion might see that neither is correct (\(D = 15\%\)).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of solving equations. They might still make errors but are more likely to evaluate claims. Katie's claim is straightforward to verify, so \(B = 50\%\), \(D = 30\%\), \(A = 10\%\), and \(C = 10\%\).
- **Proficient**: Proficient students can solve quadratic equations and evaluate claims effectively. They'll likely see Katie's solution works (\(B = 60\%\)), recognize Tom's error, and conclude \(D = 30\%\), with \(A = 5\%\) and \(C = 5\%\).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will quickly verify both claims. Given their strong understanding, \(B = 80\%\), \(D = 15\%\), with \(A = 2.5\%\) and \(C = 2.5\%\).

## 6: Provide Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
- **basic**: A=10% B=50% C=10% D=30%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
- **advanced**: A=2.5% B=80% C=2.5% D=15%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=50% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=2.5% B=80% C=2.5% D=15%
