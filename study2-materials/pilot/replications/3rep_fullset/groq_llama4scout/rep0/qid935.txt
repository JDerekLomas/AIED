To approach this question, let's analyze its components and how they might affect students at different ability levels.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question provides a part of a simultaneous equation: \(2j - k = -10\), and tells us that \(k = 8\). Students need to substitute \(k = 8\) into the equation and solve for \(j\).

## 2: Substituting \(k = 8\) into the Equation
Substituting \(k = 8\) into \(2j - k = -10\), we get \(2j - 8 = -10\).

## 3: Solving for \(j\)
To solve for \(j\), we add 8 to both sides of the equation, yielding \(2j = -2\). Then, we divide both sides by 2, which gives \(j = -1\).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Errors
A common misconception could involve incorrect substitution or incorrect handling of the equation. However, the question seems straightforward: it's about substitution and basic algebraic manipulation.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations or substitutions. They might not correctly substitute \(k = 8\) into the equation or might make errors in solving for \(j\). Given the simplicity of the algebraic steps required, a significant portion might still get it wrong due to lack of basic skills. Let's predict: A=20% (guessing), B=30% (another guess), C=30% (error in calculation), D=20% (correct but let's see if it fits).
- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to handle simple equations and substitutions. They might make some careless mistakes but should generally understand the process. So, we expect a higher percentage to get it right: A=10%, B=10%, C=20%, D=60%.
- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and should easily solve the equation. Errors would be minimal: A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level would not only solve the equation easily but also quickly recognize the correct answer, with minimal chance of error: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 6: Adjusting Predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the simple arithmetic involved, even students who are below basic might have a chance to get it right if they can substitute and solve. However, the exact percentages depend on how robust their understanding and skills are.

The best answer is D. 

Below analysis shows final predictions:
below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=20% D=50%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=3% D=93%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
