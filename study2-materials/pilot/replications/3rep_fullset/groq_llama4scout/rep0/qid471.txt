To predict how students at different ability levels might respond to this question, let's first analyze the question itself and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it presents.

The question involves a simple transaction: Summer buys a dress for £73 and two pairs of shoes for £41 each. She uses a £40 gift voucher and pays the remainder in cash. The total cost of the items is £73 (dress) + £41*2 (shoes) = £73 + £82 = £155. After applying the £40 gift voucher, she pays £155 - £40 = £115 in cash.

The correct answer is A) £115.

Now, let's consider the potential for errors or misconceptions at different ability levels:

1. **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations or understanding the question. They might not calculate the total cost correctly or forget to subtract the gift voucher amount. 
   - A=40% (some might stumble upon the correct answer through luck or simple arithmetic)
   - B=30% (might add incorrectly or misunderstand the voucher's application)
   - C=20% (could result from incorrect calculations, e.g., not subtracting the voucher or miscalculating totals)
   - D=10% (likely from significant miscalculation)

2. **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic arithmetic but might make careless mistakes or not fully understand how to apply the voucher.
   - A=60% (understand the process but might make small calculation errors)
   - B=25% (misunderstanding of the total cost or voucher application)
   - C=10% ( incorrect calculations leading to this option)
   - D=5% (significant miscalculation)

3. **Proficient**: These students understand the mathematical concepts well and are less likely to make arithmetic errors but might still misinterpret the question.
   - A=80% (accurately calculate and apply the voucher)
   - B=15% (minor errors in calculation or misunderstanding)
   - C=4% (unlikely but could result from specific miscalculations)
   - D=1% (very unlikely)

4. **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly competent and less likely to make mistakes in basic arithmetic or conceptual understanding.
   - A=95% (accurately solve the problem)
   - B=4% (minor or careless errors)
   - C=1% (unlikely errors)
   - D=0% (extremely unlikely)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
