To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie about the function \(y = 3^x\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Function
The function \(y = 3^x\) is an exponential function with base 3. This means that for any real value of \(x\), \(y\) will always be positive because any power of a positive number (in this case, 3) is positive.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom says there is no value of \(x\) that can make \(y\) negative. Given the nature of the function \(y = 3^x\), it's clear that \(y\) is always positive for all real \(x\). For example, \(3^0 = 1\), \(3^1 = 3\), and \(3^{-1} = \frac{1}{3}\). There is no value of \(x\) for which \(3^x < 0\). Therefore, Tom is correct.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie says there is no value of \(x\) that can make \(y\) equal to \(0\). For \(y = 3^x\) to be \(0\), we would need \(3^x = 0\). However, there is no real value of \(x\) for which \(3^x = 0\) because any non-zero number raised to any power is never zero. Thus, Katie is also correct.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding exponential functions and their properties. They might not fully grasp that \(3^x > 0\) for all \(x\), or they might confuse properties of exponential functions with linear or other types of functions. Given the simplicity of the statements, but potential lack of deep understanding, they might incorrectly choose options or struggle to evaluate Tom and Katie's claims accurately. Let's predict: A=30% (thinking Tom is wrong but not sure about Katie), B=20% (thinking Katie is wrong but not sure about Tom), C=20% (both are correct but not fully understood), D=30% (neither is correct, indicating misunderstanding of both statements).

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of functions but might not deeply understand the implications of exponential growth or decay. They are likely to recognize that \(y = 3^x\) is always positive but might need to think about the specific claims. Given that both Tom and Katie are correct based on the function's properties, let's predict: A=10% (Tom only, misinterpreting Katie's statement), B=10% (Katie only, misinterpreting Tom's statement), C=70% (both are correct), D=10% (neither, indicating a significant misunderstanding).

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid understanding of exponential functions and their properties. They should easily recognize that \(3^x > 0\) for all real \(x\) and that \(3^x \neq 0\) for any real \(x\). Therefore, they should find both statements correct. Let's predict: A=5% (understanding Tom but misinterpreting Katie), B=5% (understanding Katie but misinterpreting Tom), C=85% (both are correct), D=5% (a significant error).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand exponential functions but might also be familiar with more complex properties or related functions. They will certainly recognize the accuracy of both Tom's and Katie's statements. Let's predict: A=0% (recognize Tom's correctness), B=0% (recognize Katie's correctness), C=95% (both are correct, with a high level of understanding), D=5% (an unusual or careless mistake).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
