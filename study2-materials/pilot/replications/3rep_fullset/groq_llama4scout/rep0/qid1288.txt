## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks students to determine which pair of simultaneous equations has no solutions. There are two pairs of equations given, and students must analyze each pair to decide if it has a solution or not.

## 2: Analyze Pair 1
For Pair 1, the equations are $2y - 2x = 7$ and $2x - 2y = 7$. These can be simplified to $-2x + 2y = 7$ and $2x - 2y = 7$, which are essentially the same equation multiplied by -1. This means they represent the same line, and thus, they have infinitely many solutions, not no solutions.

## 3: Analyze Pair 2
For Pair 2, the equations are $2x + 2y = 7$ and $2x - 2y = 7$. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives $4y = 0$, which means $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ back into one of the equations, for example, $2x + 2y = 7$, yields $2x = 7$, so $x = 3.5$. This means Pair 2 has a solution, not no solutions.

## 4: Consider a common misconception
A common misconception might involve incorrectly adding or subtracting equations, or not fully understanding the implications of the equations representing the same line or parallel lines. However, in this case, both pairs of equations can be analyzed through simple observation or manipulation to see they do not represent parallel lines (which would have no solutions) but rather either the same line or intersecting lines.

## 5: Evaluate the difficulty of the question
The question seems straightforward for students who understand that for two lines to have no solutions, they must be parallel and not the same line. Pair 1 equations are essentially multiples of each other, indicating the same line. Pair 2, upon inspection, does not represent parallel lines since they intersect at a point.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulation and understanding of simultaneous equations. They might incorrectly assume both pairs have solutions or not understand how to compare them properly. A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless errors. They might recognize that Pair 1 has infinite solutions but struggle with Pair 2. A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and can solve simultaneous equations. They should see that Pair 1 has infinite solutions and Pair 2 has one solution. A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are highly confident in their algebraic skills and can quickly identify the nature of the solutions. A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
