To solve this, let's analyze each statement in terms of what constitutes a linear sequence. A linear sequence is one where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

## Step1: Analyze Tom's Statement
Tom says \( (n+1)^3 \) would produce a linear sequence. To check, let's expand this expression: \( (n+1)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 \). This is a cubic expression in terms of \( n \), not linear. The difference between consecutive terms will not be constant because the expression is not linear; it involves \( n^2 \) and \( n^3 \) terms.

##2: Analyze Katie's Statement
Katie says \( 3 - \frac{n}{3} \) would produce a linear sequence. Let's examine this: the general form of a linear sequence can be given as \( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \), where \( d \) is the common difference. For Katie's sequence, \( 3 - \frac{n}{3} \), we can see it can be rewritten as \( 3 - \frac{1}{3}n \). This means for every increment in \( n \) by 1, the term decreases by \( \frac{1}{3} \). Thus, it has a constant difference, making it a linear sequence.

##3: Evaluate Tom's Claim
Tom is incorrect because \( (n+1)^3 \) does not produce a linear sequence due to its cubic nature.

##4: Evaluate Katie's Claim
Katie is correct because \( 3 - \frac{n}{3} \) does produce a linear sequence.

##5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic expressions and sequence definitions. They might incorrectly identify sequences or not fully understand the implications of cubic vs. linear growth. Given the complexity, they might lean towards incorrect options due to misunderstanding the concepts. \( A=30\% \) (thinking Tom could be right due to misunderstanding), \( B=20\% \) (similarly misunderstanding Katie), \( C=10\% \) (unlikely to understand both correctly), \( D=40\% \) (some might realize neither is correct if they understand linear sequences well enough).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a better grasp of basic algebra and sequence concepts. They might still make errors but are more likely to understand what makes a sequence linear. \( A=20\% \), \( B=40\% \) (recognizing Katie's sequence as linear), \( C=10\% \) (unlikely to think both are correct given Tom's obvious mistake), \( D=30\% \).
- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid understanding of algebra and sequences. They should easily recognize Tom's sequence as non-linear and Katie's as linear. \( A=5\% \), \( B=60\% \), \( C=5\% \), \( D=30\% \).
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concepts but can also analyze them critically. They will easily see that Tom's statement is incorrect and Katie's is correct. \( A=0\% \), \( B=80\% \), \( C=0\% \), \( D=20\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=0% B=80% C=0% D=20%
