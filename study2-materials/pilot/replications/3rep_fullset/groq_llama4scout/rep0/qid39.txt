To approach this question, let's analyze the potential difficulties and misconceptions students might have when solving \( 598-1000 \).

1. **Understanding of Negative Numbers**: One common misconception is the handling of negative numbers. When subtracting a larger number from a smaller one, students might struggle with the concept of resulting in a negative number.

2. **Operational Errors**: Simple arithmetic operations can sometimes be challenging, especially when dealing with numbers of different magnitudes.

Given these considerations, here's how students at different levels might perform:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with the concept of subtracting a larger number from a smaller one and understanding negative results. They are more likely to either make calculation errors or misunderstand the concept of negative numbers.
  
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with the subtraction involving negative results. They might be more likely to incorrectly calculate or conceptualize the negative outcome.

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of arithmetic operations, including handling negative numbers. They are less likely to make errors in simple subtractions but might still be susceptible to overconfidence leading to oversight.

- **Advanced**: These students have a strong foundation and are less likely to make errors in basic arithmetic, including operations resulting in negative numbers.

Let's predict the outcomes:

### Below Basic
- A (402): This would reflect a misunderstanding of the operation, possibly thinking \( 1000 - 598 = 402 \) without considering the actual operation \( 598 - 1000 \).
- B (-402): Correct answer, understanding that \( 598 - 1000 \) results in a negative number.
- C (-412): Incorrect, could be a calculation error.
- D (This problem cannot be solved): Might reflect confusion or lack of understanding.

Prediction: below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%

### Basic
- Students here might start to understand negative numbers but could still make errors.

Prediction: basic: A=30% B=50% C=10% D=10%

### Proficient
- Mostly accurate with basic operations, understanding of negative numbers.

Prediction: proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%

### Advanced
- High accuracy expected.

Prediction: advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

So, putting it all together:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=50% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
