To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question asks to identify which diagram shows an angle of \(135^{\circ}\) using a protractor. The protractor shown is a 180-degree protractor, which might confuse some students if they are used to seeing 360-degree protractors. However, the key here is understanding how to measure an angle with a protractor and recognizing the angle \(135^{\circ}\).

## Step 1: Understanding the task
Students need to measure or estimate the angle in each diagram and identify which one corresponds to \(135^{\circ}\). 

## 2: Analyzing the options
- Option A: The angle appears to be slightly over \(130^{\circ}\) but less than \(140^{\circ}\), which could potentially be around \(135^{\circ}\) depending on the exact measurement.
- Option B: This angle seems to be less than \(135^{\circ}\), possibly around \(125^{\circ}\) to \(130^{\circ}\).
- Option C: This option suggests an angle that is measured from the other side of the protractor, which could easily confuse students. The measurement here seems to correspond to \(135^{\circ}\) when considering the full circle and how angles are measured.
- Option D: This option seems to measure an angle in the opposite direction and does not appear to represent \(135^{\circ}\).

## 3: Identifying potential misconceptions
A common misconception is not understanding how to use a protractor correctly, especially with 180-degree protractors, or misinterpreting the angle measurements. Some students might also confuse the inner and outer scales.

## 4: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with using a protractor and understanding angle measurements. They might choose randomly or based on visual estimation without precise measurement.
  - A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of angles and protractors but might still make errors in measurement or confuse the scales.
  - A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to accurately measure angles and understand the use of a protractor. They should be able to distinguish between the options more accurately.
  - A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to not only measure the angles accurately but also quickly recognize the correct answer without confusion.
  - A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

The best answer is C. 

Given the analysis:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
