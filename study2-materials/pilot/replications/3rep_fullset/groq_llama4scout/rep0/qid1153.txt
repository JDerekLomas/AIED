To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the misconceptions it targets.

The question targets two misconceptions:
1. That a triangle can have two right angles.
2. That only a scalene triangle can have a right angle.

A triangle by definition cannot have two right angles because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, and two right angles would account for 180 degrees, leaving no degrees for the third angle, which contradicts the definition of a triangle. 

A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths and all angles of different sizes. While it's true that a scalene triangle can have a right angle (it can be a right-angled scalene triangle), it's not true that only a scalene triangle can have a right angle. Right angles can also occur in isosceles right-angled triangles (where two sides and two angles are equal).

Given this:
- Tom is incorrect because a triangle cannot have two right angles.
- Katie is incorrect because having a right angle is not exclusive to scalene triangles.

Thus, the correct answer is D) Neither is correct.

**Prediction by Ability Level:**

- **below_basic:** A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20% 
    - Students at this level might not fully understand properties of triangles, so they might be tempted by Tom's statement or think Katie has a point but not fully articulate their understanding, leading to scattered choices.

- **basic:** A=25% B=20% C=10% D=45%
    - At this level, students have a basic understanding of triangles and might recognize that Tom's statement is wrong but could still be swayed by Katie's partially incorrect statement.

- **proficient:** A=5% B=15% C=5% D=75%
    - Proficient students are more likely to understand that triangles can't have two right angles and that right angles aren't limited to scalene triangles, so they'd mostly choose D.

- **advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
    - Advanced students have a deep understanding of geometric principles and would easily identify the inaccuracies in both Tom's and Katie's statements, making D the obvious choice.

The understanding and accuracy of responses increase with the ability level, reflecting a better grasp of geometric principles.
