To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the task and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might encounter.

The question presents two squares drawn on a grid: a blue square that is 3 grid squares wide and 3 grid squares long (making it a 3x3 square) and a red square drawn diagonally so that each side goes through 2 grid squares from corner to corner. The task is to compare the areas of these two squares.

## Step 1: Understanding the Blue Square's Area
The blue square has sides that are 3 units long (since it's 3 grid squares wide and 3 grid squares long), so its area is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) square units.

## 2: Understanding the Red Square's Area
The red square is drawn diagonally across grid squares, with each side intersecting 2 grid squares. This implies that the side length of the red square is \(\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}\) units, because it forms a right-angled isosceles triangle with the sides of the grid squares. The area of the red square is \((2\sqrt{2})^2 = 8\) square units.

## 3: Comparing the Areas
Comparing the areas: the blue square has an area of 9 square units, and the red square has an area of 8 square units. Therefore, the blue square has a larger area.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with calculating areas or understanding the geometry. They might not accurately calculate the areas or might be misled by the visual representation. Option A (The blue square has a larger area) might seem correct visually, but they might also consider D (It is impossible to say without measuring) due to lack of confidence in their calculations. Expect A=40%, B=20%, C=10%, D=30%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level can calculate areas but might make careless mistakes or not fully understand the diagonal measurement. They are likely to recognize the blue square's area easily but might struggle with the red square's side length. Expect A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students can accurately calculate areas and understand the geometry involved. They will likely correctly identify the blue square as having a larger area. Expect A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level will not only calculate the areas accurately but also understand the relationship between the squares' side lengths and areas. They are expected to get the correct answer with ease. Expect A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
