## Step 1: Analyze the sequence for the number of rectangles
The sequence shows that the number of rectangles increases by 1 for each term. So, for the $n^{th}$ term, there will be $n$ rectangles.

## 2: Determine the number of rectangles in the $5^{th}$ and $10^{th}$ terms
In the $5^{th}$ term, there will be 5 rectangles, and in the $10^{th}$ term, there will be 10 rectangles. Since 10 is indeed double 5, Katie is correct.

## 3: Analyze the sequence for the number of circles
The first term has 6 circles, the second term has 10 circles, and the third term has 14 circles. The increase in circles from term 1 to term 2 is 4, and from term 2 to term 3 is also 4. This suggests that each additional term adds 4 circles.

## 4: Calculate the number of circles in the $5^{th}$ term
Following the pattern, the $4^{th}$ term would have $14 + 4 = 18$ circles, and the $5^{th}$ term would have $18 + 4 = 22$ circles.

## 5: Calculate the number of circles in the $10^{th}$ term
Continuing the pattern, the $6^{th}$ term would have $22 + 4 = 26$ circles, the $7^{th}$ term would have $26 + 4 = 30$ circles, the $8^{th}$ term would have $30 + 4 = 34$ circles, the $9^{th}$ term would have $34 + 4 = 38$ circles, and the $10^{th}$ term would have $38 + 4 = 42$ circles.

## 6: Compare the number of circles in the $5^{th}$ and $10^{th}$ terms
The $5^{th}$ term has 22 circles, and the $10^{th}$ term has 42 circles. Since 42 is indeed double 21, not 22, Tom is incorrect.

## 7: Assess the likelihood of students choosing each option based on ability level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with pattern recognition and basic arithmetic. They might not accurately calculate or understand the doubling claim, potentially leading to random or incorrect choices. Given the straightforward nature of Katie's statement and the calculable nature of Tom's, they might be more likely to choose D (Neither is correct) or A (Only Tom) due to misunderstanding or lack of calculation. $A=30\%$ $B=20\%$ $C=20\%$ $D=30\%$
- **Basic:** Students here have a better grasp of basic math concepts but might still struggle with identifying patterns or making calculations under pressure. They are more likely to understand Katie's statement but might make errors in calculating or assessing Tom's claim. $A=20\%$ $B=25\%$ $C=25\%$ $D=30\%$
- **Proficient:** These students should easily recognize both patterns and perform the necessary calculations. They will likely understand that Katie is correct and Tom is incorrect, making them more inclined to choose B (Only Katie). $A=10\%$ $B=60\%$ $C=20\%$ $D=10\%$
- **Advanced:** Students at this level will quickly and accurately assess both claims. They will confirm Katie's correctness and Tom's incorrectness, solidifying their choice for B (Only Katie). $A=5\%$ $B=80\%$ $C=10\%$ $D=5\%$

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=25% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
