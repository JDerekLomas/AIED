## Step 1: Understand the question and the pie chart
The question provides a pie chart divided into 8 equal sections, with 4 sections yellow, 2 sections red, 1 section black, and 1 section white. It asks how many people wore red shirts out of 24 people at an ice hockey match.

## 2: Calculate the number of people who wore red shirts
To find out how many people wore red shirts, we need to determine what fraction of the pie chart is red and then apply that fraction to the total number of people (24). Since 2 out of 8 sections are red, the fraction of people wearing red shirts is 2/8, which simplifies to 1/4.

## 3: Apply the fraction to the total number of people
Applying the fraction 1/4 to the total number of people: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6 \).

## 4: Analyze the potential for misconceptions or errors
The question tests the ability to interpret a pie chart and apply the information to a real-world scenario. A common misconception could be misinterpreting the fractions represented by the pie chart or incorrectly calculating the number of people. However, given that the pie chart clearly shows 2 out of 8 sections are red, and there are 24 people, the calculation is straightforward.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the pie chart, fractions, or applying fractions to find a number of people. They might choose B (\( \frac{1}{4} \)) because they see the fraction but don't know how to apply it, or they might incorrectly calculate or choose D (2) if they mistakenly think 2 sections directly translate to 2 people without considering the total.
- **Basic**: Students here should understand fractions and be able to apply them to find a part of a whole. They are likely to calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 24 correctly as 6, so A (6) is the correct choice. However, some might still confuse the process and choose B (\( \frac{1}{4} \)) or D (2).
- **Proficient**: These students should easily understand the pie chart and calculate that 2/8 of 24 people is 6. Thus, they are likely to choose A (6).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will quickly and accurately calculate the number of people wearing red shirts as 6, choosing A (6).

## 6: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation once the fractions are understood:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (those who guess or partially understand), B=30% (fraction but no calculation), C=10% (random or miscalculation), D=20% (misinterpretation of sections as direct people count).
- **Basic**: A=70% (understand and calculate), B=15% (understand fraction but not calculation), C=5% (miscalculation), D=10% (misinterpretation).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (accurate calculation), B=5% (fraction error), C=3% (rare miscalculation), D=2% (misinterpretation).
- **Advanced**: A=98% (easy and accurate), B=1% (unlikely error), C=0.5% (very rare miscalculation), D=0.5% (misinterpretation).

The best answer is A.
