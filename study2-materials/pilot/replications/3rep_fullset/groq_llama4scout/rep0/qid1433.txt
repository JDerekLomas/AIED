To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( (-9)+(-4)= \), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with adding negative numbers.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to add two negative numbers, \( -9 \) and \( -4 \). The correct answer can be found by simply adding the two numbers, which results in \( -13 \) because \( -9 + (-4) = -9 - 4 = -13 \).

## 2: Common Misconceptions
A common misconception when dealing with negative numbers is that students might forget to apply the correct operation when adding two negative numbers, possibly thinking that two negatives make a positive or misinterpreting the operation altogether.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( -5 \) suggests a misunderstanding of the operation, possibly thinking \( -9 + (-4) = -9 - 4 = -5 \) due to a miscalculation or incorrect application of rules.
- Option B: \( 5 \) implies a significant misunderstanding, possibly \( -9 + 4 = -5 \) and then incorrectly adjusting to get \( 5 \), or simply not understanding that two negatives add to make a more negative number.
- Option C: \( 13 \) suggests an even greater misunderstanding, possibly confusing the operation with multiplication or forgetting to consider the negative signs.
- Option D: \( -13 \) is the correct answer.

## 4: Ability Levels and Predicted Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level are likely to have significant trouble with basic arithmetic operations, especially with negative numbers. They might confuse the operations or not fully understand the concept of adding negative numbers. 
  - A: \( 20\% \) (some might get it by chance or very basic understanding)
  - B: \( 30\% \) (confusion with positive outcomes)
  - C: \( 20\% \) (misunderstanding of operations)
  - D: \( 30\% \) (those who grasp the basic concept)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with applying rules correctly, especially under time pressure.
  - A: \( 10\% \) (less likely to make simple addition errors)
  - B: \( 20\% \) (still some confusion)
  - C: \( 10\% \) (less likely to make severe errors)
  - D: \( 60\% \) (most understand basic addition of negatives)

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of arithmetic operations, including those with negative numbers.
  - A: \( 5\% \) (unlikely to make careless mistakes)
  - B: \( 5\% \) (minimal confusion)
  - C: \( 5\% \) (severe misunderstanding unlikely)
  - D: \( 85\% \) (most get it correct)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts accurately without much effort.
  - A: \( 0\% \) (extremely unlikely to make simple errors)
  - B: \( 0\% \) (no significant confusion)
  - C: \( 0\% \) (no severe misunderstandings)
  - D: \( 100\% \) (all get it correct)

## 5: Conclusion
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding at each level:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
