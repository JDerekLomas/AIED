To approach this question, let's first understand what's being asked. The task is to factorize the quadratic expression \(x^{2} + 33x + 32\) and determine which multiplication will help achieve this. The expression can be factorized into \((x + a)(x + b)\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are numbers that multiply to \(32\) and add up to \(33\).

## Step 1: Identify the numbers that multiply to 32 and add up to 33.
We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(32\) and add up to \(33\). The factors of \(32\) are: \(1 \times 32\), \(2 \times 16\), and \(4 \times 8\). We check which pair adds up to \(33\): \(1 + 32 = 33\), \(2 + 16 = 18\), and \(4 + 8 = 12\).

## 2: Determine the correct option.
From Step 1, it's clear that \(1\) and \(32\) are the numbers that add up to \(33\) and multiply to \(32\). Therefore, the correct option to help factorize \(x^{2} + 33x + 32\) is \(1 \times 32\), which corresponds to option A.

## 3: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand the concept of factorizing quadratic expressions or might not be able to identify the correct factors. They might randomly select an option or choose based on a common misconception. Given the straightforward nature of the question once the method is understood, and assuming the method is taught, \(A = 40\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 20\%\).
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might struggle with applying the concepts to slightly harder questions. They are more likely to recognize the need to find factors of \(32\) that add to \(33\), but might make calculation errors. \(A = 70\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Proficient:** Students at this level are comfortable with the concept and can apply it accurately. They will likely choose the correct option with high confidence. \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 3\%\), \(D = 2\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also manipulate and apply it with ease. They are highly likely to choose the correct option. \(A = 95\%\), \(B = 3\%\), \(C = 1\%\), \(D = 1\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
