To tackle this question, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie regarding midpoints and assess their validity.

## Step 1: Understand what a midpoint is.
The midpoint \( M \) between two points \( P \) and \( Q \) is given by the formula \( M = \frac{P + Q}{2} \). This implies that \( M \) is equidistant from both \( P \) and \( Q \), and the line segment \( PQ \) is bisected by \( M \).

## 2: Analyze Tom's statement.
Tom claims that if you know the location of \( M \) only, then there is more than one possible location for \( P \) and \( Q \). This can be visualized as follows: if \( M \) is fixed, \( P \) and \( Q \) can be anywhere on the line such that \( M \) is their midpoint. This essentially means \( P \) and \( Q \) can be on a line parallel to any line on which \( M \) lies, but \( M \) must be the midpoint of \( PQ \). For any given \( M \), there are infinitely many pairs of \( P \) and \( Q \) that satisfy this condition by being on a line that passes through \( M \) but on opposite sides of \( M \) and equidistant from it. Thus, Tom is correct.

## 3: Analyze Katie's statement.
Katie says if you only know the locations of \( M \) and \( Q \), then there is more than one possible location for \( P \). Given \( M \) and \( Q \), \( P \) must be such that \( M = \frac{P + Q}{2} \). Rearranging this equation gives \( P = 2M - Q \). This means that there is exactly one possible location for \( P \) given \( M \) and \( Q \), as the position of \( P \) is uniquely determined by \( M \) and \( Q \). Therefore, Katie is incorrect.

## 4: Determine the correct answer based on the analysis.
Given that Tom is correct and Katie is incorrect, the statement that "Only Tom" is correct is true.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of a midpoint and its implications. They might not fully grasp the relationship between points and midpoints, potentially leading to confusion. However, the straightforward nature of Tom's statement and the simplicity of Katie's scenario might still guide some to the correct answer. Let's assume A=60% (Tom's intuitive correctness might sway them), B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of geometry and midpoints. They might start to see the validity in Tom's argument but could be misled by Katie's statement due to a lack of deep understanding. So, A=70%, B=15%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the geometric concepts well and can analyze statements logically. They should easily identify Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness. Hence, A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the concepts but can also reason abstractly. They will quickly see through both statements and choose the correct option. Thus, A=90%, B=0%, C=5%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
