To approach this question, let's first understand the mathematical concept involved and then analyze the options given.

The task is to subtract 98 from a number. A common strategy to make subtraction easier is to use compensation, where you adjust the numbers to make the calculation simpler. Subtracting 98 can be thought of as subtracting 100 and then adding 2, because -98 = -100 + 2.

Let's examine the options:

A: \( +100 \) then \( +2 \) - This would actually increase the number by 102, not decrease it by 98.

B: \( -100 \) then \( -2 \) - This would decrease the number by 102, not 98.

C: \( -100 \) then \( +2 \) - This option correctly represents subtracting 98. You subtract 100 (which decreases the number) and then add 2 (which increases it), effectively subtracting 98.

D: \( +100 \) then \( -2 \) - This would increase the number by 98, which is the opposite of what is needed.

Given these explanations:

- **below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of compensation in subtraction. They might not understand how to adjust numbers to simplify calculations. 
  - A: 20% (some might mistakenly think adding makes it bigger and the "+2" corrects it)
  - B: 30% (could mistakenly think subtracting 100 and then more decreases the number further)
  - C: 20% (some might get it through trial and error or partial understanding)
  - D: 30% (adding then subtracting could seem like a balanced approach)

- **basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to not fully grasping the compensation method.
  - A: 10% 
  - B: 20% 
  - C: 60% (as they start to understand the compensation method)
  - D: 10%

- **proficient**: These students are expected to understand and apply the compensation method accurately.
  - A: 5% 
  - B: 5% 
  - C: 85% 
  - D: 5%

- **advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also apply it in various contexts efficiently.
  - A: 0% 
  - B: 0% 
  - C: 95% 
  - D: 5% 

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
