To predict how students at different ability levels would respond to this question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question requires students to write the number \( 60302 \) in words. The correct answer is \( \text{S Sixty thousand three hundred and two} \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The number given is \( 60302 \). This can be broken down into \( 60,000 + 3,000 + 0 + 0 + 2 \), which translates to sixty thousand three hundred and two.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve mixing up place values or not correctly interpreting the number in terms of thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones. For example, some might incorrectly read \( 60302 \) as \( 6 \) thousand and \( 30 \) and \( 2 \), leading to "Six thousand three hundred and two."

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A, "Six hundred and thirty-two," suggests a misunderstanding of place value, confusing \( 60302 \) with \( 632 \). This seems unlikely for most students who can read numbers but might occur in a small percentage, particularly at lower ability levels.

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B, "Six thousand three hundred and two," is a plausible mistake if students misread \( 60,000 \) as \( 6,000 \), which could happen, especially if they are not paying close attention to the number of digits and their positions.

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C, "Sixty thousand and thirty-two," suggests a mistake where the student correctly identifies "sixty thousand" but then fails to include "three hundred," possibly getting confused about how to express the number in words correctly.

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D, "Sixty thousand three hundred and two," is the correct answer. Students who are proficient or advanced in maths are likely to choose this option.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle significantly with place value and number reading. They might choose A (\( 10\% \)), B (\( 30\% \)), C (\( 20\% \)), and D (\( 40\% \)), as their understanding is limited.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors. They could choose A (\( 5\% \)), B (\( 20\% \)), C (\( 15\% \)), and D (\( 60\% \)).
- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of number reading. They might choose A (\( 1\% \)), B (\( 10\% \)), C (\( 5\% \)), and D (\( 84\% \)).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to have a very strong understanding of this concept. They would likely choose D (\( 98\% \)), with minimal errors.

## 8: Providing Percentages
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=\( 10\% \) B=\( 30\% \) C=\( 20\% \) D=\( 40\% \)
- **basic:** A=\( 5\% \) B=\( 20\% \) C=\( 15\% \) D=\( 60\% \)
- **proficient:** A=\( 1\% \) B=\( 10\% \) C=\( 5\% \) D=\( 84\% \)
- **advanced:** A=\( 0\% \) B=\( 1\% \) C=\( 1\% \) D=\( 98\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=1% B=10% C=5% D=84%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=1% D=98%
