To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question involves the expression \(-6^{2}\). A common misconception among students is not following the order of operations correctly, specifically not understanding that the exponentiation comes before the negation. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), exponentiation is performed before negation.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Calculation
The correct calculation for \(-6^{2}\) is \(-(6^{2}) = -36\), because the exponentiation is evaluated first, and then the negation is applied.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A potential misconception is that students might interpret \(-6^{2}\) as \((-6)^{2}\), which equals \(36\). However, the expression given is \(-6^{2}\), not \((-6)^{2}\). Another misconception could be simply not following the order of operations.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(12\). This seems unrelated to the direct calculation of \(-6^{2}\) and is likely to be chosen by students who have no understanding of the order of operations or make a significant calculation error.
- Option B: \(-12\). This could be chosen by students who misinterpret the operation entirely or make a calculation mistake.
- Option C: \(36\). This option might be chosen by students who incorrectly interpret \(-6^{2}\) as \((-6)^{2}\).
- Option D: \(-36\). This is the correct answer, following the order of operations.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the order of operations or might incorrectly calculate the expression. They might choose options based on a literal reading of the expression without calculation or with incorrect calculation. So, A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still struggle with the order of operations or might be confused by the notation. They are more likely to make mistakes but have a chance of getting it right. So, A=10%, B=20%, C=40%, D=30%.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the order of operations and are less likely to make mistakes. They should mostly choose D, but some might still be tricked into C. So, A=5%, B=5%, C=20%, D=70%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are very familiar with the order of operations and the specific notation. They are highly likely to choose the correct answer. So, A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=20% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
