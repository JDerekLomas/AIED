To approach this question, let's consider what's being asked and the common misconceptions or challenges students might face when expanding brackets, particularly with a product of three binomials.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to predict how many terms Nadia should get after she simplifies the expression \((p+8)(p+2)(p+1)\). To do this, students need to understand how to expand products of binomials.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve misunderstanding how the number of terms in the expanded form relates to the number of terms in the factors. However, the key here is to recognize that expanding \((p+8)(p+2)(p+1)\) will result in a polynomial of degree 3. When fully expanded, a product of three binomials typically results in a cubic polynomial, which can have up to 4 terms (including the constant term).

## 3: Analyzing the Expansion Process
Expanding \((p+8)(p+2)\) first gives \(p^2 + 10p + 16\). Then, multiplying this by \((p+1)\) yields:
\[ (p^2 + 10p + 16)(p+1) = p^3 + p^2 + 10p^2 + 10p + 16p + 16 \]
\[ = p^3 + 11p^2 + 26p + 16 \]
This results in a cubic polynomial with 4 terms.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic expansion or might count terms incorrectly. They might choose an option based on a misunderstanding of what "simplifying" means or not fully expanding the expression. Option C (3 terms) could be appealing if they misunderstand the process or don't see the cubic term. A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might make straightforward errors. They should recognize the expansion results in more than 3 terms but might not accurately count. Option D (4 terms) seems likely for most as it's the correct answer. A=5% B=15% C=20% D=60%
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic expansion well. They should accurately count the terms after expansion, recognizing the result will be a cubic polynomial with 4 terms. A=0% B=5% C=5% D=90%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the expansion but can also do it efficiently. They will quickly identify the correct number of terms. A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=5% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
