To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 20 \% \) of \( \pounds 140= \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to calculate 20% of £140. This is a straightforward percentage calculation.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be confusing the percentage with a simple fraction or miscalculating the percentage of the given amount. For example, students might mistakenly calculate 20% as 20/100 * 140, but then incorrectly solve it or confuse it with other operations.

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A: \( £ 280 \). This would be the result of doubling £140, not calculating 20% of it. It's unlikely to be chosen by proficient or advanced students but could be a tempting option for those not confident in their calculations.

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B: \( £ 20 \). This seems too low and would likely be a result of a miscalculation, such as 20% being confused with 2% or another error.

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C: \( £ 120 \). This option does not relate to a simple calculation error from 20% of £140 and seems to subtract 20 from 140, which is not a percentage calculation.

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D: \( £ 28 \). This is the correct calculation: \( 20 \% \) of \( \pounds 140 = 0.20 \times 140 = \pounds 28 \).

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic percentage calculations. They might choose A (10%) because it's a large number close to doubling, B (40%) because it's a simple low number, C (30%) because it involves subtracting, and D (20%) because it's the correct answer but might not be recognized as such.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding but might still make calculation errors. They could choose A (5%) for similar reasons, B (20%) for being a low, easy option, C (15%) for lack of understanding, and D (60%) as they start to grasp percentage calculations.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students are likely to understand percentages well. They might choose A (1%) because it's clearly incorrect, B (5%) for being a clearly incorrect low option, C (5%) for similar reasons, and D (89%) because they can calculate 20% of £140 accurately.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including percentages. They are highly unlikely to choose A, B, or C, and very likely to choose D (99%).

## 8: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
- **basic**: A=5% B=20% C=15% D=60%
- **proficient**: A=1% B=5% C=5% D=89%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=1% D=99%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=1% B=5% C=5% D=89%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=1% D=99%
