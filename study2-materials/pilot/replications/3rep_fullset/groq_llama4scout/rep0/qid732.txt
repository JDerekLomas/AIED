## Step 1: Understand the question and the inequalities given
The question provides a diagram with two lines, \(2 = x + y\) and \(x = y\), and asks to identify which of the given coordinates satisfies the inequalities \(2 < x + y\) and \(x < y\).

## 2: Analyze the inequality \(2 < x + y\)
This inequality describes a region in the coordinate plane. The line \(2 = x + y\) can be rewritten as \(y = -x + 2\). This line has a y-intercept at (0,2) and an x-intercept at (2,0). The inequality \(2 < x + y\) represents all the points above this line.

## 3: Analyze the inequality \(x < y\)
The line \(x = y\) divides the plane into two parts. The inequality \(x < y\) represents all the points above this line.

## 4: Combine the inequalities
To satisfy both \(2 < x + y\) and \(x < y\), a point must be above the line \(y = -x + 2\) and above the line \(y = x\).

## 5: Examine the options
- A: \((3,1)\)
- B: \((1,1)\)
- C: \((1,3)\)
- D: \((-3,1)\)

## 6: Check each option against the inequalities
- For A: \(2 < 3 + 1\) is \(2 < 4\), which is true. But \(3 < 1\) is false. So, A does not satisfy both inequalities.
- For B: \(2 < 1 + 1\) is \(2 < 2\), which is false. So, B does not satisfy both inequalities.
- For C: \(2 < 1 + 3\) is \(2 < 4\), which is true. And \(1 < 3\) is true. So, C satisfies both inequalities.
- For D: \(2 < -3 + 1\) is \(2 < -2\), which is false. So, D does not satisfy both inequalities.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding inequalities and graphing. They might not correctly substitute values into the inequalities or understand the graphical representation. Option C seems correct based on calculations, but these students might choose incorrectly due to miscalculation or misunderstanding of the inequalities. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 30\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 20\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple algebraic or conceptual mistakes. They are more likely to correctly apply the inequalities but could be misled by the graphical aspect or simple calculations. \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 60\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and can apply them accurately. They should easily identify that C satisfies both inequalities. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 85\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concepts but also can quickly and accurately analyze the situation. They will almost certainly choose C. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 95\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
