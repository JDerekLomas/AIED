## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question requires students to calculate the time taken for a particle to travel with given acceleration, initial velocity, and final velocity using the formula \( t=\frac{1}{a}(v-u) \). This can be rearranged from the standard equation \( v = u + at \) to \( t = \frac{v - u}{a} \).

## 2: Identifying the correct formula application
The correct application of the formula is \( t = \frac{v - u}{a} \), which directly corresponds to option D: \( t=(8.7-2.8) \div 4.1 \). This option correctly applies the formula.

## 3: Analyzing potential misconceptions and errors
- Option A incorrectly suggests \( t=\frac{1}{a}+(v-u) \), which does not match any standard kinematic equation and seems to confuse the formula.
- Option B, \( t=4.1 \times(8.7-2.8) \), incorrectly multiplies acceleration by the change in velocity, which could be a misconception about how \( a \), \( v \), \( u \), and \( t \) relate.
- Option C, \( t=4.1+(8.7-2.8) \), simply adds acceleration to the change in velocity, which does not correspond to any correct kinematic equation.

## 4: Predicting student responses by ability level
### Below Basic
Students at this level might struggle with applying formulas and could easily fall into common misconceptions. They might choose options that seem to involve basic operations without fully understanding the formula.
- A: 20% (adding and dividing in a seemingly correct but actually incorrect manner)
- B: 30% (misconception about multiplication)
- C: 20% (simple addition, might seem intuitive but incorrect)
- D: 30% (correct application, but might be challenging for this group)

### Basic
Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to not fully grasping the formula or misapplying it.
- A: 15% (less likely to choose due to understanding of basic operations)
- B: 25% (still a plausible incorrect choice)
- C: 15% (less likely, as addition seems too simple)
- D: 45% (starting to understand the correct formula application)

### Proficient
Proficient students are expected to have a good grasp of the formulas and their applications.
- A: 5% (unlikely, as the formula is misunderstood)
- B: 10% (could still be a trap, but less likely)
- C: 5% (unlikely, as it doesn't match any formula)
- D: 80% (correct application, expected for this group)

### Advanced
Advanced students are likely to have a deep understanding and can apply formulas accurately and quickly.
- A: 0% (very unlikely)
- B: 0% (unlikely, given understanding)
- C: 0% (not a correct approach)
- D: 100% (expected to apply correctly without hesitation)

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=15% B=25% C=15% D=45%
- proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=25% C=15% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
