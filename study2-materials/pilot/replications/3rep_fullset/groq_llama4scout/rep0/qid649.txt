To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding related to multiplying decimals.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question revolves around the commutative property of multiplication, which states that \(a \times b = b \times a\). For decimals, this property holds. However, Tom's statement \(5 \times 3.9 = 3 \times 5.9\) suggests an incorrect manipulation, implying that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of one of the numbers and a different decimal. Katie's statement \(5 \times 3.9 = 3.9 \times 5\) correctly applies the commutative property.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom's statement is incorrect because it does not properly demonstrate the commutative property. The correct manipulation to test the commutative property would involve swapping the numbers entirely, not altering one of the numbers.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie's statement is correct as it directly applies the commutative property of multiplication, which is true for all numbers, including decimals.

## 4: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the concept of decimal multiplication and the commutative property. They might not fully understand the implications of Katie's statement or could be confused by Tom's incorrect manipulation. Expect a high likelihood of choosing D (Neither is correct) or possibly A (Only Tom) due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of multiplication with decimals and might recognize Katie's statement as correct due to the commutative property. However, they might still be confused by Tom's statement or not fully grasp the error. Expect a significant percentage to choose C (Both Tom and Katie) or B (Only Katie), with some still choosing D.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the commutative property and can identify that Katie's statement is correct. They should recognize Tom's statement as incorrect. Thus, they are likely to choose B (Only Katie).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the commutative property but can also quickly identify incorrect statements. They will clearly see that Katie is correct and Tom is incorrect, leading them to choose B (Only Katie).

## 5: Predicting Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (misunderstanding), B=20% (partial understanding), C=20% (lack of discrimination), D=30% (total confusion)
- **Basic:** A=10% (misled by Tom), B=40% (understands Katie), C=30% (overly optimistic), D=20% (some confusion)
- **Proficient:** A=5% (rare misunderstanding), B=80% (correct identification), C=10% (some confusion), D=5% (clear understanding)
- **Advanced:** A=0% (clear understanding), B=90% (correct), C=5% (extreme optimism), D=5% (unfamiliar with question type)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
