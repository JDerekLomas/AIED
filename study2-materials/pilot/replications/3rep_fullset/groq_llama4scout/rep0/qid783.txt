To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and how students at different levels might respond.

The question requires students to understand how the standard form of a quadratic equation \(y = (x + p)^2 + q\) relates to the graph of a parabola, specifically one that has been translated from the basic \(y = x^2\) form. The graph provided shows a parabola that has been translated 2 units to the right and 9 units down from \(y = x^2\). 

The equation for a parabola translated \(h\) units to the right and \(k\) units down from \(y = x^2\) can be written as \(y = (x - h)^2 + k\). Comparing this to the given form \(y = (x + p)^2 + q\), if the graph is translated 2 units to the right, \(p = -2\) (since it's \(x - 2\) inside the parenthesis to shift right), and if it's translated 9 units down, \(q = -9\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Translations
The parabola \(y = x^2\) translated 2 units to the right becomes \(y = (x - 2)^2\), which matches the form \(y = (x + p)^2\) with \(p = -2\). 

## 2: Understanding the Vertical Translation
The vertical translation down by 9 units changes \(y = (x - 2)^2\) to \(y = (x - 2)^2 - 9\). Thus, \(q = -9\).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle to understand the relationship between the graph and the equation. They might not correctly interpret the translations or might confuse \(p\) and \(q\). There's a high chance they could choose \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 30\%\), with a significant spread due to confusion.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in identifying \(p\) and \(q\) or in applying the translations correctly. They are likely to get \(p = -2\) but might struggle with \(q\). So, \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 60\%\), \(D = 20\%\).
- **Proficient:** These students understand the translation effects on the equation. They know that moving right 2 units means \(x - 2\) or \(x + (-2)\), and down 9 units changes \(q\) to \(-9\). So, \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 80\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but can apply it quickly and accurately. They would easily identify \(q = -9\). Hence, \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 90\%\), \(D = 10\%\).

The best answer is C. 

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
