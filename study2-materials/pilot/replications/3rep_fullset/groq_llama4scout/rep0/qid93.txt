## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks for the equation of a quadratic curve with a minimum point at (1,0). This information directly suggests the vertex form of a quadratic equation, \(y = a(x - h)^2 + k\), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola. Given the vertex \((1, 0)\), the equation can be written as \(y = a(x - 1)^2\).

## 2: Determine the value of \(a\)
Since the minimum point is \((1, 0)\), and there's no additional information suggesting the curve is stretched or compressed vertically (which would change \(a\)), we assume \(a = 1\) for simplicity, leading to the equation \(y = (x - 1)^2\). This matches option A.

## 3: Analyze option A
Option A, \(y = (x - 1)^2\), directly corresponds to a parabola with its vertex at \((1, 0)\), which is what the question describes. This should be the correct answer.

## 4: Consider common misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the vertex form with the standard form or misinterpreting the coordinates of the vertex. However, given that the vertex \((1, 0)\) directly implies \(h = 1\) and \(k = 0\), and assuming \(a = 1\) (as the simplest case), option A is straightforward.

## 5: Evaluate other options
- Option B, \(y = (x + 1)^2\), suggests a vertex at \((-1, 0)\), which does not match the given information.
- Option C, \(y = x^2 - 1\), can be expanded but does not have its vertex at \((1, 0)\); its vertex is \((0, -1)\).
- Option D, \(y = x^2 + 1\), has its vertex at \((0, 1)\), which also does not match.

## 6: Predict student responses by ability level
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand the vertex form or to apply given information to select the correct equation. They might be confused by the options and choose based on superficial similarities or errors in calculation. A=40% (recognizing the vertex), B=20% (mistaking the sign), C=20% (partially correct form but wrong vertex), D=20% (completely incorrect).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and might more readily identify the correct vertex form. A=60% (correct), B=15% (error in vertex), C=10% (incorrect form), D=15% (completely incorrect).
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand the vertex form well and apply it correctly. A=80% (correct), B=5% (minor error), C=5% (misunderstanding of vertex or form), D=10% (rare mistake).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students should have a strong grasp of quadratic equations and their vertex form. A=90% (correct), B=2% (very rare mistake), C=3% (unlikely but possible mistake), D=5% (rare error).

## 7: Format the predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
- proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
- advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%
