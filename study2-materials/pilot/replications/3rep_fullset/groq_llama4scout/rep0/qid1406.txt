## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to multiply two terms from the given brackets: \(2p\) from the first bracket \((2p-1)\) and \(-4\) from the second bracket \((3p-4)\). The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each of the provided options.

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
The question aims to test a common misconception in multiplying terms with variables and constants, specifically when dealing with negative signs. The correct multiplication is \(2p \times -4 = -8p\).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(+6p\)
- Option B: \(+8p\)
- Option C: \(-2p\)
- Option D: \(-8p\)

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic operations. They might ignore the negative sign or mishandle the multiplication. Expect a high chance of error.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might still make careless mistakes. They should know how to multiply but might get confused with the negative sign.
- **Proficient:** These students are expected to handle algebraic expressions confidently and accurately. Mistakes here would likely be careless.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident and proficient in algebra. Errors are less likely.

## 5: Estimating Error Rates
Given that the question directly points to the terms to be multiplied and they are straightforward, most students, even at lower levels, should be able to get it right if they follow the basic rules of algebra. The common error would be to forget the negative sign or misinterpret the multiplication.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (completely wrong, ignoring both the coefficient and the negative sign), B=20% (wrong coefficient, ignoring negative sign), C=20% (wrong operation or sign), D=20% (correct).
- **Basic:** A=10% (careless mistake), B=5% (similar), C=10% (might confuse operations), D=75% (correct).
- **Proficient:** A=2% (rare careless mistake), B=1% (extremely rare), C=2% (unlikely but could happen), D=95% (correct).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no chance), B=0% (no chance), C=0% (no chance), D=100% (correct).

## 7: Finalizing Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic:** A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=5%, C=10%, D=75%
- **Proficient:** A=2%, B=1%, C=2%, D=95%
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=10% D=75%
proficient: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
