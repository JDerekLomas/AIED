To approach this question, let's analyze each option given and determine its validity based on the condition that \( n \) is a positive integer and the expression must always be a multiple of 5.

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( n + 5 \). For \( n = 1 \), \( n + 5 = 6 \), which is not a multiple of 5. Therefore, option A is not always a multiple of 5.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( 2n + 3 \). For \( n = 1 \), \( 2n + 3 = 5 \), which is a multiple of 5. However, for \( n = 2 \), \( 2n + 3 = 7 \), which is not a multiple of 5. So, option B is not always a multiple of 5.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( 10n \). Since \( 10n \) is always a multiple of 10 for any integer \( n \), it is also always a multiple of 5. This option seems to fulfill the condition.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \( 5n + 2 \). For \( n = 1 \), \( 5n + 2 = 7 \), which is not a multiple of 5. Therefore, option D is not always a multiple of 5.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of multiples or may not be able to analyze the expressions effectively. They might choose options that seem "simple" or might pick A or D because they involve basic operations with 5.
  - A: 30% (because it directly involves adding 5)
  - B: 20% (seems like a normal equation, but they might not test values)
  - C: 30% (recognize 10n as a multiple of 10 and thus 5)
  - D: 20% (involves 5, but they might not consider the +2)

- **Basic:** Students here have a better grasp but might still fall for common misconceptions or not fully consider the implications of \( n \) being a positive integer.
  - A: 20% (less likely to think it's always a multiple)
  - B: 25% (might think it's a possibility but should realize it's not always)
  - C: 45% (likely to understand that 10n is always a multiple of 5)
  - D: 10% (unlikely to think it's always a multiple)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts well and are likely to analyze each option systematically.
  - A: 10% (should realize it's not always a multiple)
  - B: 15% (should see it's not always)
  - C: 60% (clearly always a multiple of 5)
  - D: 15% (should recognize it's not always)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are likely to quickly and accurately assess each option.
  - A: 5% (very unlikely to choose)
  - B: 5% (should easily dismiss)
  - C: 85% (very confident in their choice)
  - D: 5% (unlikely to consider)

Given these analyses, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
