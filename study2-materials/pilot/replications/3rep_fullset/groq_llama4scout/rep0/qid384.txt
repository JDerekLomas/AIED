## Step 1: Understand the concept of parallel lines in the context of linear equations.
To determine if two lines are parallel, they must have the same slope but different intercepts. The given line is $y = -2x + 7$, which means it has a slope of $-2$.

## 2: Analyze option A.
Option A is $3y = -6x - 8$. To compare, we need to express it in slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$. Dividing every term by 3 gives $y = -2x - \frac{8}{3}$. Since the slope is $-2$, it is parallel to the given line.

## 3: Analyze option B.
Option B is $y = -(8 - 2x)$. Simplifying gives $y = -8 + 2x$ or $y = 2x - 8$. The slope here is $2$, which is not equal to $-2$, so it's not parallel to the given line.

## 4: Analyze option C.
Option C is $y = 2 - 2x$. This can be rewritten as $y = -2x + 2$. Since the slope is $-2$, it is parallel to the given line.

## 5: Analyze option D.
Option D is $y = 2(1 - x)$. Simplifying gives $y = 2 - 2x$. This can be rewritten as $y = -2x + 2$. Since the slope is $-2$, it is parallel to the given line.

## 6: Determine the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with rearranging equations and understanding the concept of slope. They might incorrectly identify parallel lines or not fully understand the question. Given the simplicity of the slopes in the options, they might still manage to identify B as not parallel but could be confused by the forms of the equations.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra and the concept of slope. They should easily identify that option B has a different slope and thus is not parallel.
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebra and can easily rearrange equations into slope-intercept form. They should quickly identify B as the line not parallel to the given line.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them quickly and accurately. They will easily identify B.

## 7: Predict the percentages based on the analysis.
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might recognize the slope), B=60% (most likely to pick the one that stands out as different), C=10% (might confuse with parallel lines), D=10% (similar confusion).
- **Basic**: A=5% (unlikely to misidentify), B=80% (clearly not parallel), C=5% (confusion), D=10% (some confusion).
- **Proficient**: A=0% (no confusion), B=90% (clear identification), C=0% (no confusion), D=10% ( rare mistake).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
