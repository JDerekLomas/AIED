To approach this question, let's analyze the options and the concept of cube numbers. A cube number is the result of multiplying an integer by itself twice, i.e., \(n^3\). Let's examine each option:

A: \(3\) - This is \(1^3 + 2\), not a perfect cube, but close to \(2^3 = 8\). Actually, \(3\) is not a cube of an integer; \(3 = \sqrt[3]{27}\) approximately, but exactly it's between \(1^3=1\) and \(2^3=8\).

B: \(36\) - Not a cube number; it's \(6^2\), a square number.

C: \(64\) - This is \(4^3\), a cube number.

D: \(21\) - Not a cube number; there isn't an integer \(n\) for which \(n^3 = 21\).

The concept here is straightforward: students need to recognize which number is a perfect cube. 

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not have a strong grasp of what constitutes a cube number or might confuse it with square numbers or other mathematical operations. They are more likely to guess or misunderstand the concept. 
  - A: \(10\%\) (some might recognize \(3\) is not immediately identifiable as a cube)
  - B: \(20\%\) (Could mistakenly think it's a cube due to not understanding)
  - C: \(40\%\) (This is a straightforward option for those who know \(4^3 = 64\))
  - D: \(30\%\) (Guessing or similar confusion)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to lack of practice or deeper understanding.
  - A: \(5\%\) 
  - B: \(10\%\)
  - C: \(80\%\) (Recognize \(64\) as \(4^3\))
  - D: \(5\%\)

- **Proficient:** These students should have a solid grasp of the concepts.
  - A: \(0\%\) (They know \(3\) isn't a cube)
  - B: \(0\%\) (They recognize \(36\) isn't a cube)
  - C: \(95\%\) (Easily identify \(64\) as a cube)
  - D: \(5\%\) (Minimal chance of confusing \(21\) as a cube)

- **Advanced:** This group not only understands but can apply and often see connections between numbers.
  - A: \(0\%\)
  - B: \(0\%\)
  - C: \(100\%\) (No doubt about \(64\) being \(4^3\))
  - D: \(0\%\)

Therefore, predicting based on understanding and common misconceptions:

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
