To solve this, let's consider the total number of rectangles in the shape and what 22% of that would be.

The shape consists of 5 rows and 9 columns, making a total of \(5 \times 9 = 45\) rectangles.

To find 22% of 45, we calculate \(45 \times 0.22 = 9.9\).

Since we can't shade a fraction of a rectangle, we need to consider the closest whole numbers, which are 9 or 10 rectangles. However, the question asks how many rectangles would need to be shaded to make 22% of the shape shaded, implying we are looking for an exact solution or an acknowledgment that an exact solution isn't possible with whole rectangles.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question essentially asks for the number of rectangles to shade to achieve 22% of the total area shaded. Given that 22% of 45 rectangles is 9.9, the exact percentage cannot be achieved with a whole number of rectangles.

## 2: Analyzing Possible Answers
- A: 22 rectangles would be 22/45 * 100 = 48.89%, which is far too high.
- B: 44 rectangles would be 44/45 * 100 = 97.78%, also far too high.
- C: 11 rectangles would be 11/45 * 100 = 24.44%, which is close but still not 22%.
- D: Not possible, because achieving exactly 22% with whole rectangles is not feasible due to the 9.9 rectangle calculation.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with percentages and fractions of a whole. They might choose A or B because they misunderstand the percentage or are simply guessing. C might seem plausible for some. D could be chosen by those who realize it's not exactly achievable but might not have the confidence to select it. 
  - A=30% (guessing or misunderstanding)
  - B=20% (similarly guessing)
  - C=30% (thinks it's close enough or misunderstands)
  - D=20% (recognizes the issue but isn't sure)

- **Basic:** Students here have a better grasp but might still make careless mistakes. They might calculate or estimate and choose C as it's the closest or understand that D is correct because 9.9 rectangles can't be shaded.
  - A=10% 
  - B=5%
  - C=60% (estimates or calculates to find it's close)
  - D=25% (understands the precision issue)

- **Proficient:** These students should accurately calculate or have a good sense of percentages. They would likely understand that 9.9 rectangles are needed, making C (11 rectangles) the closest but not exact. They'd likely choose D.
  - A=5%
  - B=0%
  - C=20%
  - D=75%

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the math but also the implications of the question. They would quickly see that 22% of 45 is 9.9, making it impossible to shade exactly 22% with whole rectangles.
  - A=0%
  - B=0%
  - C=5%
  - D=95%

The best answer is below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=60% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=20% D=75%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
