## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question tests the student's ability to translate a real-world scenario into a mathematical expression. The scenario involves a taxi driver charging an initial £2.50 plus £1.20 per mile travelled. The correct expression for the total cost, \( T \), of a journey of \( m \) miles should be \( T = 1.20m + 2.50 \), which corresponds to option B.

## 2: Identify potential misconceptions and errors.
A common misconception could be adding the initial charge and the per-mile charge in a way that doesn't correctly represent the situation. For example, some students might incorrectly add the charges or misinterpret how the initial charge and the mileage charge are combined.

## 3: Analyze option A.
Option A, \( T = 2.50m + 1.20 \), suggests multiplying the initial charge by the miles travelled and then adding the per-mile charge, which is incorrect. This could appeal to students who misunderstand the role of the initial charge.

## 4: Analyze option B.
Option B, \( T = 1.20m + 2.50 \), correctly represents the total cost as the per-mile charge times the miles travelled plus the initial charge. This is the correct formula.

## 5: Analyze option C.
Option C, \( T = 1.20(2.50 + m) \), implies that the per-mile charge is applied to both the initial charge and the miles travelled, which distorts the given charges.

## 6: Analyze option D.
Option D, \( T = 3.70m \), suggests that the total cost is just the sum of the initial charge and the per-mile charge multiplied by the miles travelled, ignoring the initial charge.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with forming equations from word problems. They might choose options that seem to combine the costs in any way, not necessarily understanding the difference between initial and per-mile charges. Option A and D might be tempting because they represent simple, but incorrect, calculations. Option B is likely to be chosen by a small percentage because it requires understanding the problem.
- **Basic:** Students here might have a better grasp of forming simple equations but could still fall into traps. They might recognize the initial charge and per-mile charge but mix them up. Option B should start to look more appealing as they understand the structure of the equation.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily identify the correct formula. They understand how to translate word problems into algebraic expressions and are less likely to be swayed by incorrect options.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the algebraic representation but are also likely to quickly dismiss incorrect options due to their strong mathematical foundation.

## 8: Assign percentages based on ability levels and question difficulty.
Given the question's clarity and the straightforward nature of the correct answer, even students at lower ability levels might have a chance to select the correct option if they understand the basic concept of initial and per-mile charges.

- **Below Basic:** A=30% (simple multiplication error), B=20% (understanding but struggling), C=15% (misinterpreting how charges are applied), D=35% (completely misunderstanding).
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=95%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
