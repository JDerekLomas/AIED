## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to simplify the given algebraic fraction: \( \frac{6 p-9}{6 p-3} \). To simplify this, we look for common factors in the numerator and denominator.

## 2: Identifying Common Factors
Both \(6p - 9\) and \(6p - 3\) have a common factor of \(3\). Factoring this out gives: \( \frac{3(2p - 3)}{3(2p - 1)} \).

## 3: Simplifying the Fraction
The \(3\) in the numerator and denominator can be cancelled out, leaving: \( \frac{2p - 3}{2p - 1} \).

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( \frac{2 p-3}{2 p-1} \) matches our simplified form.
- Option B: \( -3 \) does not match.
- Option C: \( 3 \) does not match.
- Option D: \( \frac{p-3}{p-1} \) does not match.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebra and factoring. They might not simplify correctly or might try to cancel terms incorrectly. Option A seems unlikely to be chosen by many as they might not get the correct simplification. Options B and C might attract some due to confusion or incorrect cancellation. Option D could be appealing if students mistakenly factor or simplify incorrectly. Predicted percentages: A=20% (if they somehow manage to get it right or are lucky), B=30%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebraic manipulations. They should be able to factor and simplify correctly. However, some might make careless mistakes. Predicted percentages: A=60%, B=15%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students are confident with algebraic manipulations and should easily simplify the fraction correctly. Predicted percentages: A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very comfortable with algebra and should have no trouble simplifying the given expression. Predicted percentages: A=90%, B=2%, C=2%, D=6%.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
- proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
- advanced: A=90% B=2% C=2% D=6%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=2% D=6%
