To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to temperature comparisons.

The question asks to compare two temperatures: \( -5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) and \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). The correct approach is to find the difference between the two temperatures, which is \( 2 - (-5) = 7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). This means \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) hotter than \( -5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \), making option B the correct answer.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception could be misunderstanding the direction of temperature differences (hotter or colder) or calculating the difference incorrectly, especially when dealing with negative numbers.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A suggests \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 3^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) hotter than \( -5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). This would be incorrect because, as calculated, the difference is \( 7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \), not \( 3^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \).

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C suggests \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 3^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) colder than \( -5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). This is also incorrect because \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is actually warmer than \( -5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \), and the correct difference is \( 7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) in the warmer direction.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D suggests \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) colder than \( -5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). This is incorrect because it not only misstates the direction (colder instead of hotter) but also correctly calculates the \( 7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) difference.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic arithmetic operations, especially with negative numbers. They might choose options based on incorrect calculations or misunderstandings. Option A might seem plausible to some due to partial understanding or guesswork. \( A = 30\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 30\% \).

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make careless mistakes. They are more likely to understand the concept of temperature differences but might miscalculate or choose wrong due to lack of attention to detail. \( A = 15\% \), \( B = 60\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 15\% \).

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make simple arithmetic mistakes. They should predominantly choose the correct option. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 80\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 10\% \).

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the concept well but are also less prone to errors in calculations. They are expected to almost universally choose the correct option. \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 90\% \), \( C = 0\% \), \( D = 10\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
