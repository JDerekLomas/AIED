To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about finding the gradient of the line \(5x + 3y = 15\), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to find the gradient of a line given in the general form of a linear equation (\(5x + 3y = 15\)). To find the gradient, the equation needs to be rearranged into the slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the gradient.

## 2: Rearranging the Equation
Rearranging \(5x + 3y = 15\) to solve for \(y\), we get \(3y = -5x + 15\), and then \(y = -\frac{5}{3}x + 5\). Thus, the gradient (\(m\)) of the line is \(-\frac{5}{3}\).

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be that students might not correctly rearrange the equation or might confuse the coefficients, leading them to incorrectly identify the gradient. Specifically, they might forget to change the sign when rearranging the equation or might not properly isolate \(y\).

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- A: \(5\) - Incorrect, could be a result of misinterpreting the coefficients or not rearranging the equation properly.
- B: \(-5\) - Incorrect, similar to option A, but with a negative sign; might result from confusion or incorrect rearrangement.
- C: \(\frac{5}{3}\) - Incorrect, likely a result of not changing the sign of the coefficient of \(x\) when rearranging.
- D: \(-\frac{5}{3}\) - Correct, the actual gradient of the line.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle significantly with rearranging equations and understanding the concept of gradient. They are likely to choose A or B due to a lack of understanding of how to rearrange the equation or the concept of gradient. C might also be chosen by those who partially understand but make a critical error. D would be chosen by few, if any, at this level.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with the algebraic manipulation. They might lean towards A or C due to partial understanding or simple errors in calculation. B and D might be less commonly chosen, with D being the correct answer.
- **Proficient:** At this level, students are more likely to correctly rearrange the equation and identify the gradient. They would likely choose D. Options A, B, and C might still be considered by some due to careless mistakes.
- **Advanced:** These students would almost certainly choose D, as they have a strong grasp of algebraic concepts and can easily rearrange equations and identify gradients.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Given the above analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (overconfidence in simple coefficient), B=30% (similar reasoning), C=25% (partial understanding), D=5% (very few understand).
- **Basic:** A=25%, B=20%, C=30%, D=25%.
- **Proficient:** A=10%, B=5%, C=15%, D=70%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=25% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=15% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
