## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks students to estimate the gradient of a curve at a specific point $t=8$ seconds, given a graph of velocity $v$ against time $t$ for a parachutist. The graph includes a tangent line at $(8, 51)$ and another point $(0, 40)$ through which the tangent line passes.

## 2: Recall the formula for gradient
The gradient of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. For the tangent line at $t=8$, we can use the points $(8, 51)$ and $(0, 40)$ to estimate the gradient.

## 3: Calculate the gradient
Using the formula, the gradient $= \frac{51 - 40}{8 - 0} = \frac{11}{8} = 1.375$.

## 4: Analyze option A
Option A is $51$. This is the $y$-coordinate of the point on the curve at $t=8$, not the gradient.

## 5: Analyze option B
Option B is $0.72...$. This seems too low for the gradient given the points provided.

## 6: Analyze option C
Option C is $1.375$, which matches our calculation for the gradient.

## 7: Analyze option D
Option D is $6.375$. This seems too high for the gradient given the points $(8, 51)$ and $(0, 40)$.

## 8: Consider student misconceptions and difficulties
Students might confuse the gradient with the $y$-value (velocity) at $t=8$, or they might make calculation errors. The question requires understanding of what the gradient represents (rate of change of velocity) and the ability to apply the gradient formula.

## 9: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: These students might not understand the concept of gradient or might confuse it with other aspects of the graph. They are likely to choose A ($51$) because it's a straightforward read from the graph, or they might not attempt to calculate it.
- **Basic**: Students at this level might attempt to calculate but could make errors. They might choose A if they don't understand what gradient means, or they might incorrectly calculate it.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of gradient and can calculate it. They should choose C ($1.375$) as it matches their calculation.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concept but can also apply it accurately and consider the context. They are likely to choose C ($1.375$) but might also quickly dismiss A, B, and D as incorrect.

## 10: Estimate percentages
Given the calculation and common misconceptions:
- **Below_basic**: A=70% (misinterpreting gradient as velocity), B=10%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Basic**: A=40% (common misconception), B=20%, C=30% (correct calculation), D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=5%, C=80% (correct), D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
