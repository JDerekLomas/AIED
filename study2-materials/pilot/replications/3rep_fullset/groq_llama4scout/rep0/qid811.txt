To approach this question, let's break it down by understanding what a linear sequence is and then analyzing the statement given.

A linear sequence is one where each term increases or decreases by a constant difference. The general form of a linear sequence can be given by \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\), where \(a_n\) is the \(n^{\text{th}}\) term, \(a_1\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference between each term.

## Step 1: Understand the Statement
The statement claims that if you know the first term of a linear sequence and you multiply it by \(10\), you get the \(10^{\text{th}}\) term of that sequence. In formula terms, this means \(10a_1 = a_{10}\).

## 2: Apply the Linear Sequence Formula
Using the linear sequence formula, \(a_{10} = a_1 + (10-1)d = a_1 + 9d\).

## 3: Analyze the Condition for the Statement to be True
For the statement to be true, \(10a_1 = a_1 + 9d\). Simplifying this equation gives \(9a_1 = 9d\), or \(a_1 = d\).

## 4: Interpretation of the Condition
This means the statement is only true if the first term \(a_1\) is equal to the common difference \(d\). If \(a_1 \neq d\), the statement is false.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with the abstract concept of sequences and algebraic manipulations. They might not fully understand the condition under which the statement holds. A significant portion might think the statement is always true or always false without considering the conditions. \(A=40\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=30\%\), \(D=10\%\)
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of sequences but might still struggle with algebraic expressions. They may realize the statement isn't always true but might not fully articulate the condition. \(A=20\%\), \(B=40\%\), \(C=30\%\), \(D=10\%\)
- **Proficient**: These students understand linear sequences and can manipulate algebraic expressions. They should recognize that the statement's truth depends on \(a_1 = d\). \(A=10\%\), \(B=60\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=10\%\)
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the condition but can also analyze the statement's validity based on the sequence's properties. They are likely to choose "sometimes true" as they recognize \(a_1 = d\) makes it true. \(A=5\%\), \(B=80\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=5\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
