To approach this question, let's analyze the options and the properties of an equilateral shape, then consider how students at different ability levels might respond.

An equilateral shape, by definition, has all sides of equal length. Additionally, all angles in an equilateral shape are equal, and since the sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, each angle in an equilateral triangle is 60 degrees. Therefore, an equilateral shape must have all sides equal and all angles equal.

Let's evaluate the options:
- A: All sides equal. This is true but does not fully capture the definition since it doesn't mention angles.
- B: All sides and all angles equal. This accurately describes an equilateral shape.
- C: A right angle. This is incorrect because an equilateral triangle has 60-degree angles, not 90-degree angles.
- D: All angles equal. While true, this option does not mention side lengths, which are also a crucial part of the definition.

Given these considerations:

- **below_basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the geometric terms. They might confuse properties of shapes or not fully recall definitions.
  - A=40% (some understanding that sides are equal)
  - B=20% (might be too detailed for them to recall accurately)
  - C=20% (misconception about right angles)
  - D=20% (partial understanding, focusing on angles)

- **basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might not fully appreciate the nuances.
  - A=50% (recognize sides are equal but might not think of angles)
  - B=30% (correct but comprehensive, might be challenging for basic level)
  - C=10% (less likely to think of right angles for equilateral)
  - D=10% (recognize angles are equal but forget about sides)

- **proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of geometric properties.
  - A=10% (mostly understand it's not just about sides)
  - B=80% (accurately recall both aspects of equilateral shapes)
  - C=5% (unlikely to mistakenly think of right angles)
  - D=5% (understand angles but also know sides are crucial)

- **advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply definitions precisely.
  - A=0% (know it's more than just sides)
  - B=95% (precisely recall the definition)
  - C=0% (no chance of confusing with right angles)
  - D=5% (might consider this partially correct but incomplete)

Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
