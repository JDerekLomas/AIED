To approach this question, let's first analyze the methods Tom and Katie use to calculate \(21 \times 12\) mentally and then determine if their methods are correct.

Tom does \(12 \times 7\) and then multiplies his answer by \(3\). 
- \(12 \times 7 = 84\)
- \(84 \times 3 = 252\)

Katie does \(21 \times 6\) and then doubles her answer.
- \(21 \times 6 = 126\)
- \(126 \times 2 = 252\)

Both Tom and Katie arrive at the same answer, \(252\), which is the correct result for \(21 \times 12\).

Now, let's consider the likelihood of students at different ability levels choosing each option:

## Step 1: Understanding the Methods
Both methods are algebraically sound. Tom's method can be seen as \(12 \times 7 \times 3 = 12 \times (7 \times 3) = 12 \times 21\), and Katie's method is \(21 \times 6 \times 2 = 21 \times (6 \times 2) = 21 \times 12\). 

## 2: Analyzing Potential Errors
The question is testing the recognition of correct algebraic manipulations. A common misconception might involve not understanding the associative property of multiplication or making calculation errors.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts or understanding the operations. They might not accurately calculate \(12 \times 7\) or \(21 \times 6\), and could easily make errors in doubling or multiplying by 3. Given the simplicity of the calculations but the need to understand the method's validity, there might be a spread across options but with a significant chance of incorrect answers due to calculation mistakes.

## 4: Detailed Predictions
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30% (These students might randomly select or mistakenly calculate, leading to a spread but with a notable percentage in incorrect options).
- **Basic**: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10% (Students here understand basic operations and are more likely to see both methods as correct if they compute them accurately).
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5% (These students are likely to accurately compute and understand both methods are correct).
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5% (Advanced students will quickly see the algebraic validity of both methods and choose C, with very few errors).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
