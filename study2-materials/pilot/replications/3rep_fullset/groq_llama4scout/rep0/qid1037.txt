To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "What is \( 4 \% \) of \( 200 ? \)", let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or ease of calculation.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for \( 4 \% \) of \( 200 \). This can be calculated as \( 0.04 \times 200 = 8 \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions or Errors
- A common misconception might involve misunderstanding percentages or incorrectly applying them.
- Another error could be adding or subtracting the percentage value from the original number instead of multiplying.

## 3: Analyzing Option A (\( 4 \))
This option suggests a misunderstanding of percentages, possibly thinking \( 4 \% \) means \( 4 \) units out of \( 100 \) units of \( 200 \), which doesn't align with correct percentage calculation.

## 4: Analyzing Option B (\( 204 \))
This could result from adding \( 4 \% \) of \( 200 \) to \( 200 \), or another incorrect operation.

## 5: Analyzing Option C (\( 80 \))
This might result from mistakenly calculating \( 4 \% \) as \( 40 \% \) or another miscalculation.

## 6: Analyzing Option D (\( 8 \))
This is the correct answer. \( 4 \% \) of \( 200 = 0.04 \times 200 = 8 \).

## 7: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic percentage calculations. They might choose A, B, or C due to misunderstandings. Option D seems unlikely for many.
- **Basic:** Students here might understand percentages but make calculation errors. They are more likely to get it right than below basic but might still choose A or B.
- **Proficient:** These students should understand percentages well and calculate correctly, likely choosing D.
- **Advanced:** This group should easily calculate and understand the concept, also choosing D.

## 8: Making Predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the question and assuming typical student performance:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (simple, incorrect multiplication/addition), B=20% (adding 4 to 200), C=20% (mistaken percentage), D=30% (correct, surprisingly).
- **Basic:** A=10% (misunderstanding), B=10% (addition error), C=10% (calculation mistake), D=70% (mostly correct).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (occasional slip), B=5% (rare mistake), C=5% (unlikely error), D=85% (mostly correct).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (unlikely), B=0% (unlikely), C=0% (unlikely), D=100% (correct).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
