## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question provides the first term of a linear sequence as 7 and the fourth term as 25. It asks for the eighth term of the sequence.

## 2: Identifying the common difference
To find the eighth term, we first need to determine the common difference (d) between terms. Given that it's a linear sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

## 3: Calculating the common difference
The formula for the nth term of a linear sequence is \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\), where \(a_n\) is the nth term, \(a_1\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference. We know \(a_1 = 7\) and \(a_4 = 25\). So, we can set up the equation for the fourth term as \(25 = 7 + (4-1)d\).

## 4: Solving for d
Simplifying the equation gives \(25 = 7 + 3d\). Subtracting 7 from both sides gives \(18 = 3d\). Dividing both sides by 3 gives \(d = 6\).

## 5: Finding the eighth term
Now that we know \(d = 6\), we can find the eighth term using the formula \(a_8 = 7 + (8-1)6\).

## 6: Calculating the eighth term
Substituting the values gives \(a_8 = 7 + 7 \times 6 = 7 + 42 = 49\).

## 7: Predicting student responses
- The correct answer is A: 49.
- To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, we must consider the likelihood of errors given the context.

## 8: Analyzing potential misconceptions and errors
A common misconception might involve incorrect calculation of the common difference or misapplication of the sequence formula. However, given the straightforward nature of this problem and the fact that the numbers are easy to work with, errors might be less frequent than in more complex or ambiguous questions.

## 9: Estimating response rates
- **Below_basic**: Students might struggle with the concept of sequences or basic arithmetic, potentially leading to a higher chance of incorrect answers. Let's assume A=60% (correct), B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: These students should be able to handle the arithmetic but might make careless mistakes. Let's assume A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should easily solve the problem. Let's assume A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to get it right without issue. Let's assume A=99%, B=0.5%, C=0.25%, D=0.25%.

The best answer is A.
