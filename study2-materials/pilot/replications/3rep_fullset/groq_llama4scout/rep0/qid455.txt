To approach this question, let's analyze the content and potential misconceptions.

The expression given is \(p^{2} - 5p\). This is a simple algebraic expression that can be factorized by taking out a common factor. The correct factorization is \(p(p - 5)\), which corresponds to option A.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception in factorizing expressions like \(p^{2} - 5p\) could be trying to apply the difference of squares formula if the expression were \(p^{2} - 25\), which would factor into \((p+5)(p-5)\). However, \(p^{2} - 5p\) does not fit this pattern because it's not a difference of squares.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(p(p - 5)\) is the correct factorization.
- Option B: \((p+5)(p-5)\) would be correct if the expression were \(p^{2} - 25\), not \(p^{2} - 5p\).
- Option C: \((p+\sqrt{5})(p-\sqrt{5})\) suggests a difference of squares leading to \(p^{2} - 5\), not \(p^{2} - 5p\).
- Option D: "Does not factorise" is incorrect because \(p^{2} - 5p\) can indeed be factorized.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic factorization. They might not recognize that \(p\) is a common factor, leading them to choose "Does not factorise" (D) or incorrectly apply formulas like difference of squares (B or C). Let's assume A=40% (some can do simple factorization), B=20% (mistaking it for a difference of squares), C=10% (another misconception), D=30% (genuine struggle).
- **Basic:** Students here should be more familiar with factorization. The correct answer A should be more apparent, but some might still fall into traps. Let's assume A=70%, B=15%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily recognize the common factor and correctly factorize. Let's assume A=90%, B=5%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have a deep understanding and rarely make such errors. Let's assume A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

## 4: Converting to Requested Format
Given the assumptions:
- below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
- basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
- proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
- advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
