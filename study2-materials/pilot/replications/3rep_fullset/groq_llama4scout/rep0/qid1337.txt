To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the methods Tom and Katie use to calculate \(28 \times 15\) mentally.

## Step 1: Understand Tom's Method
Tom calculates \(28 \times 15\) by first doing \(28 \times 5\) and then multiplying his answer by \(3\). Since \(15 = 5 \times 3\), Tom's method is essentially \((28 \times 5) \times 3 = 28 \times (5 \times 3) = 28 \times 15\), which is correct.

## 2: Understand Katie's Method
Katie does \(14 \times 15\) and then doubles her answer. Her method can be seen as \((14 \times 15) \times 2 = 14 \times 15 \times 2 = 14 \times 30 = (14 \times 2) \times 15 = 28 \times 15\), which is also correct because she effectively doubles the \(14\) to get \(28\).

## 3: Analyzing the Methods for Errors
Both Tom and Katie's methods are actually correct. Tom's method directly multiplies \(28\) by \(15\) through associative property, and Katie's method adjusts the \(14\) to \(28\) by doubling it, then keeps the \(15\) constant.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication and may not fully understand mental math strategies. They might incorrectly assume only one method is correct or neither is, due to lack of understanding. So, they might be more likely to choose D (Neither is correct) or randomly select an option. \(A=20\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=30\%\), \(D=30\%\)
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might not fully grasp the properties of multiplication. However, they should recognize both methods as viable. \(A=10\%\), \(B=10\%\), \(C=60\%\), \(D=20\%\)
- **Proficient**: These students understand multiplication properties and can likely see that both Tom and Katie's methods are correct. \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=80\%\), \(D=10\%\)
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can also explain why both methods are correct. They are less likely to make errors. \(A=0\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=90\%\), \(D=10\%\)

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
