To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, we must consider the common misconceptions related to subtracting negative numbers and the specific characteristics of this question.

The question is: \((-8) - (-5) = \square\)

This can be rewritten as \(-8 + 5\), which equals \(-3\). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception when dealing with subtracting negative numbers is that students might forget to change the sign of the second number when subtracting a negative, leading to incorrect calculations. For example, \(-8 - (-5)\) might be incorrectly calculated as \(-8 - 5 = -13\).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(-13\). This would result from incorrectly calculating \(-8 - 5\).
- Option B: \(13\). This result does not follow from any simple arithmetic mistake related to the given operations.
- Option C: \(3\). Similar to option B, this does not directly result from a common mistake with the given operation.
- Option D: \(-3\). This is the correct result of \(-8 + 5\).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with basic arithmetic operations and may not fully understand the rules for subtracting negative numbers. They are likely to make simple errors. 
  - A: High chance of selecting A because they might not understand that subtracting a negative is the same as adding.
  - B: Unlikely, as it requires a more complex error.
  - C: Unlikely, for similar reasons as B.
  - D: Low percentage, as they might not correctly apply the rules.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying rules consistently.
  - A: Significant percentage might choose A due to misunderstanding the operation.
  - B: Low percentage, as it's not a straightforward mistake.
  - C: Low percentage, similar to B.
  - D: Higher percentage than below basic but might still be challenged.

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of arithmetic operations, including subtracting negative numbers.
  - A: Some might still choose A if they are careless or not fully attentive.
  - B: Very low percentage, as it doesn't align with common operations.
  - C: Very low percentage, similar to B.
  - D: High percentage, as they understand the operation.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their arithmetic skills and understanding of number operations.
  - A: Low percentage, as they are well aware of the correct operation.
  - B: Extremely low, as there's no logical pathway to this answer.
  - C: Extremely low, similar to B.
  - D: Very high percentage, as they can easily and accurately compute \(-8 - (-5)\).

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis, here are rough estimates:
- **Below Basic:** A=60% B=5% C=5% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=40% B=5% C=5% D=50%
- **Proficient:** A=20% B=2% C=2% D=76%
- **Advanced:** A=5% B=1% C=1% D=93%

The best answer is D.
