To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and the ease or difficulty of the question for students at different levels.

1. **Understanding of the Question**: The question asks for the number of days in a non-leap year. A non-leap year, by definition, has 365 days.

2. **Common Misconceptions**: A common misconception might involve confusing non-leap years with leap years or not knowing the definition of each. Leap years have 366 days, which is a well-known fact. 

3. **Analysis by Ability Level**:

   - **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic facts. They might not recall that a non-leap year has 365 days, potentially confusing it with a leap year (366 days) or guessing completely random numbers.
   
   - **Basic**: At this level, students have a grasp of basic concepts but might make careless mistakes or not have memorized every detail. However, the number of days in a year is a fundamental fact that most would know.
   
   - **Proficient**: Students here have a solid understanding of the concepts and are less likely to make simple factual errors. They should easily recall that a non-leap year has 365 days.
   
   - **Advanced**: These students not only know the fact but can also apply it and understand the context. They are highly unlikely to make errors on such a straightforward question.

4. **Predicting Student Responses**:

   - **Below Basic**: 
     - A=20% (random guess, seems a bit low but plausible for those who don't know),
     - B=30% (could confuse with leap year),
     - C=40% (correct answer, but might not recall),
     - D=10% (seems too low and unrealistic).

   - **Basic**:
     - A=5% (unlikely guess),
     - B=20% (might confuse with leap year),
     - C=70% (should know this),
     - D=5% (unlikely guess).

   - **Proficient**:
     - A=0% (not a plausible guess),
     - B=5% (unlikely to confuse),
     - C=95% (very confident in this fact),
     - D=0% (not a plausible guess).

   - **Advanced**:
     - A=0% (no chance of this guess),
     - B=0% (no chance of confusing with leap year),
     - C=100% (absolutely confident),
     - D=0% (no chance of this guess).

The best answer is C. 
Given the above analysis, a realistic prediction, adjusting for a somewhat more realistic distribution and ensuring percentages add to 100%, could look like:

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=50% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
