To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with angle relationships on parallel lines.

The question presents a scenario where Tom and Katie discuss angle relationships on parallel lines. Tom claims that allied (co-interior) angles are equal, while Katie states that corresponding angles are equal. The correct relationship on parallel lines is that corresponding angles are equal, and allied (co-interior) angles are supplementary, not equal.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
Students often confuse the properties of angles on parallel lines. A common misconception is thinking that allied (co-interior) angles are equal, which could lead them to support Tom's statement. However, it's well-established in basic geometry that corresponding angles are equal and that allied angles are supplementary.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A (Only Tom) would be chosen by students who incorrectly believe allied angles are equal but know or think corresponding angles are not equal, or those who do not recognize Katie's statement as correct.
- Option B (Only Katie) would be correct for students who understand corresponding angles are equal but are aware that allied angles are not equal (they are supplementary).
- Option C (Both Tom and Katie) would be chosen by students who mistakenly believe both statements are correct, indicating a lack of understanding of both concepts.
- Option D (Neither is correct) would be selected by students who understand that allied angles are supplementary (not equal) and corresponding angles are equal, thus recognizing both Tom and Katie's statements as incorrect.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may not fully grasp the concepts of angle relationships on parallel lines. They might choose A or C due to a lack of understanding, but there's a high chance they would struggle to identify the correct relationships. Given the simplicity of the question and the direct nature of the statements, a significant portion might incorrectly choose A (Only Tom) because it's a direct claim, or C (Both Tom and Katie) if they don't understand either concept. D=20%, A=40%, B=20%, C=20%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors. They are more likely to recognize Katie's statement as correct but might still be confused about Tom's. Thus, B (Only Katie) seems likely, but some may still choose A or C. D=10%, A=30%, B=45%, C=15%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the basic properties of angles on parallel lines. They know corresponding angles are equal and would likely choose B (Only Katie) as they understand her statement is correct and Tom's is not. A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the properties but can also apply them in various contexts. They would easily identify Katie's statement as correct and Tom's as incorrect, thus choosing B. For them, the question might be too straightforward, but they would still answer accurately. A=0%, B=90%, C=5%, D=5%.

## 4: Finalizing Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- **basic:** A=30% B=45% C=15% D=10%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=45% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
