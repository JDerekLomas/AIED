## Step 1: Understand the question and the composite shape
The question asks for the area of the shaded section of a composite shape made from rectangles. The shape consists of 3 steps, with the full width being 23m and the full height being 22m. The dimensions of the steps are given, and the shaded section is a rectangle that starts in the top left of the second (middle) step and finishes in the bottom right of the diagram.

## 2: Determine the dimensions of the shaded section
To find the area of the shaded section, we first need to determine its dimensions. The shaded section's width can be found by subtracting the width of the first lower step from the full width and then finding the portion that corresponds to the middle step, but it's simpler to directly calculate using given measurements. The shaded section's height and width can be directly inferred from the diagram: the width of the shaded area is 6m (width of the top step) + (23m - 7m - 6m) is not needed, instead, we focus on the 7m and 6m for the bottom two steps' widths and the given heights.

## 3: Calculate the dimensions and area of the shaded section
The height of the shaded section can be determined by subtracting the height of the first step from the total height: 22m - 5m = 17m, but for the shaded part specifically, we consider its actual height which is from the top of the second step to the bottom, so 22m - (5m + (8m - the part that would complete to the top of the shaded rectangle)) is unnecessary. Instead, notice the shaded rectangle goes from the top of the middle step down to the bottom and across from the left of the middle step to the right edge. The correct approach is to find the area of the large rectangle that includes the shaded part and subtract the unshaded parts.

## 4: Break down the shape into calculable parts
The shaded area can be found by calculating the area of the entire rectangle that bounds the shaded region and subtracting the areas of the unshaded triangles or rectangles. However, given the staircase nature, a straightforward approach is to see the shaded rectangle's dimensions directly: width = 17m (from 7m to 23m, but specifically for shaded, it's 7m + 6m = 13m for the base steps, and then add the portion that completes it) and height = 14m (from 5m height to 19m, but specifically 22m - 8m = 14m).

## 5: Correctly calculate the shaded area
The correct dimensions for the shaded rectangle are width = 17m (as 23 - 6 = 17) and height = 14m (as it goes from 8m height to 22m). So, the area = 17m * 14m = 238m^2 - areas not shaded. Alternatively, directly: The shaded rectangle's area can also be approached by considering it as part of the total area minus the areas not shaded. The unshaded part to the left of the shaded rectangle is a rectangle of 5m by 6m (30m^2), and there's no unshaded part to the right as the shaded goes to the edge.

## 6: Simplify the calculation based on given data
The total area of the steps can also guide us: The area of the first step (7m*5m), the second step (7m*8m), and the third step (6m*8m) can help. But to directly compute the shaded area without confusion: The shaded area seems to directly relate to subtracting non-shaded from total relevant areas.

## 7: Execute the area calculation
Let's simplify: Shaded area = Total area of rectangle formed by full height and relevant width - Unshaded areas. Given the staircase: Area = length * width for each part and sum. However, I notice we directly compute shaded: its length is 17 (since from right edge to left edge of steps is 23, and non-shaded parts widths are given) and height 14 (22 - 8).

## 8: Calculate the area based on visualized dimensions
Area of shaded = 17 * 14 = 238. But notice my previous misstep in dimensions; accurately, for calculation: if we see the diagram properly, for middle and right steps combined width is 13 (7+6), height covered by shaded is 14 (22-8), hence area = 13 * 14 = 182, seems off. Rechecking for clarity and use of diagram: Shaded region actually goes 7m wide (for one part) and 6m for another, across 14m height.

## 9: Final calculation with accurate dimensions
The shaded region's correct calculation directly uses: (7+6
