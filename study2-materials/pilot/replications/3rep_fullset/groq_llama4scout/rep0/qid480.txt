To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "What number is \( 100 \) more than \( 72980 ? \)", let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it might present.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires adding 100 to 72980. This is a straightforward addition problem that tests basic arithmetic skills.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions or Errors
A common misconception might involve misplacing or miscounting the addition of 100, potentially leading to errors like subtracting 100, adding 1000, or incorrectly placing the digits.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( 73,080 \) suggests adding 1000 and then some incorrect adjustment.
- B: \( 73,980 \) suggests correctly adding 100 to 72980.
- C: \( 7,298,000 \) implies a significant misunderstanding, possibly multiplying by 100.
- D: \( 72,080 \) suggests subtracting 100 and then some.

## 4: Assessing Difficulty by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic addition and subtraction facts, and are likely to make significant errors. They might choose A, C, or D due to a lack of understanding of place value or basic arithmetic operations.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic arithmetic but might still make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose B but might also consider A or D if they misunderstand the operation or miscalculate.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level are expected to accurately perform basic arithmetic operations. They should overwhelmingly choose B.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only perform arithmetic operations accurately but also understand the context and can apply their knowledge to solve problems efficiently. They should also choose B.

## 5: Predicting Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question, most students, even at the basic level, should be able to get it right.

- **Below Basic:** A=30% (misinterpreting the operation), B=40% (getting it right by chance or partial understanding), C=20% (significant miscalculation), D=10% (subtracting incorrectly).
- **Basic:** A=10% (careless mistake), B=85% (correct understanding and calculation), C=3% (misunderstanding the scale), D=2% (incorrect subtraction).
- **Proficient:** A=2% (minor error), B=95% (accurate calculation), C=1% (significant error), D=2% (unlikely but possible minor error).
- **Advanced:** A=1% (unlikely error), B=98% (accurate and efficient), C=0.5% (extremely unlikely significant error), D=0.5% (very unlikely error).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=85% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
