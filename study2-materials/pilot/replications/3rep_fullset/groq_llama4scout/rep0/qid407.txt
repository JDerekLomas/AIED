To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question provides a speed-time graph and asks for the best estimate of the distance traveled between 6 and 8 seconds. The correct method to solve this involves calculating the area under the curve between these two time points, as the area under a speed-time graph represents distance.

Given:
- At 6 seconds, the speed is 8 m/s.
- At 8 seconds, the speed is 15 m/s.

## Step 1: Understand the Graph
The graph isn't visually provided, but we can infer it's a straight line or approximately so between 6 and 8 seconds because no other information is given about the shape of the graph in this interval.

## 2: Estimate the Distance
Assuming a linear increase in speed (which would be the case if the graph is a straight line between these points):
- The increase in speed from 6 to 8 seconds is \(15 - 8 = 7\) m/s.
- The time interval is \(8 - 6 = 2\) seconds.

## 3: Calculate Average Speed
The average speed between 6 and 8 seconds can be estimated as \((8 + 15) / 2 = 11.5\) m/s.

## 4: Calculate Distance
The distance traveled in 2 seconds at an average speed of 11.5 m/s is \(11.5 \times 2 = 23\) meters.

## 5: Evaluate Options
Given this calculation, the closest option is \(24 m\), which suggests that most students who understand the concept of area under a speed-time graph representing distance and can estimate average speed over an interval will choose this option.

## 6: Consider Misconceptions and Errors
Students might make errors if they:
- Misinterpret the graph (e.g., assume a different shape).
- Fail to calculate average speed.
- Use the speeds at the endpoints incorrectly.

However, given the straightforward nature of this question and the calculation involved, the majority of students, especially those at the proficient or advanced levels, are likely to get it right.

## 7: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with calculating average speed or understanding the concept of distance from a speed-time graph. They might choose \(A=20\%\), \(B=30\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=30\%\), as they could be guessing or applying incorrect formulas.
- **Basic**: Students at this level might have a grasp of basic concepts but could make calculation errors. They might choose \(A=10\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=60\%\), \(D=10\%\), as they start to understand the method but might not calculate accurately.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and can apply them. They would likely choose \(C=80\%\), with \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(D=10\%\), as they accurately calculate the distance.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can also analyze and apply concepts accurately. They would likely choose \(C=90\%\), with minimal selection of other options, \(A=2\%\), \(B=2\%\), \(D=6\%\).

The best answer is C.
