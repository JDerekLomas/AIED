To predict how students at different ability levels might respond to converting \( \frac{3}{20} \) into a decimal, let's consider the common misconceptions and the ease or difficulty of this specific question.

Converting a fraction to a decimal involves dividing the numerator by the denominator. In this case, \( \frac{3}{20} \) can be converted by dividing 3 by 20. A common error might involve miscalculation or confusion with equivalent fractions/decimals.

1. **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic division or understanding of fractions. They might incorrectly calculate \( \frac{3}{20} \) or confuse it with a more familiar fraction. 
   - A: \( 0.15 \) seems like a plausible but not immediately obvious answer without calculation.
   - B: \( 0.3 \) could be a guess if they mistakenly think \( \frac{3}{20} = \frac{3}{10} \).
   - C: \( 3.20 \) might seem correct if they misunderstand the division process entirely and just add or incorrectly place the numbers.
   - D: \( 0.12 \) might not be immediately apparent without calculation.

2. **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless errors.
   - They are likely to attempt the division but might make a simple miscalculation.

3. **Proficient:** These students understand the process and can usually execute it correctly with minimal errors.

4. **Advanced:** Students at this level not only perform the conversion accurately but might also do so efficiently, possibly converting \( \frac{3}{20} \) to \( \frac{15}{100} \) directly to get 0.15.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic:** A=30% (because it might seem like a reasonable answer upon some thought or incorrect calculation), B=20% (common misconception), C=30% (misunderstanding of fraction/decimal), D=20% (another potential miscalculation).
- **Basic:** A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10% (most get it right but some make errors).
- **Proficient:** A=85%, B=5%, C=5%, D=5% (most convert correctly with ease).
- **Advanced:** A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1% (nearly all get it right).

Therefore:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
