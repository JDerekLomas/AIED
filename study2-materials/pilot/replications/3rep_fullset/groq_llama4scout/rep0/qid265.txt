## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the perpendicular height \(h\) of a cone, given its slant height and half the base length. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

## 2: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem
Given the slant height of the cone is 9cm, and half the base (which forms one of the other two sides of the right-angled triangle) is 6cm, we can apply the theorem as \(h^{2} + 6^{2} = 9^{2}\), because \(h\) is the side we are trying to find, 6cm is one side, and 9cm (the slant height) is the hypotenuse.

## 3: Rearranging the Equation
Rearranging the equation to solve for \(h^{2}\), we get \(h^{2} = 9^{2} - 6^{2}\). This matches option B.

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(h^{2}=9^{2}+6^{2}\) is incorrect because it suggests the slant height is one of the shorter sides, not the hypotenuse.
- Option B: \(h^{2}=9^{2}-6^{2}\) is correct based on the Pythagorean theorem.
- Option C: \(h^{2}=12^{2}+9^{2}\) is incorrect because it uses 12 (which would be the full base diameter, not half) and 9 in an inappropriate relationship.
- Option D: \(h^{2}=12^{2}-9^{2}\) is incorrect for similar reasons as C, and also misinterprets the relationship.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the Pythagorean theorem or misinterpret the diagram. They might choose A (20%) because it seems like a straightforward application of the theorem without considering which side is the hypotenuse. B might be chosen by 60% if they understand the theorem but not the question fully. C and D might each get around 10%.
- **Basic:** At this level, students understand the theorem but might be tricked by the presentation. B should be the clear winner (70%), with A getting around 20%, and C and D each getting around 5%.
- **Proficient:** Students here are expected to apply the theorem accurately. B should be chosen by 90%, with A getting around 5%, and C and D negligible.
- **Advanced:** These students are highly confident in their understanding. B should be chosen by 95%, with minimal or no selection of other options.

## 6: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
- basic: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
- proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
- advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
