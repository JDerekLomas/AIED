To approach this question, let's analyze the information given and the nature of the graphs provided as options. The taxi company charges a £1.50 fixed charge and then 60p per mile. This means the cost increases linearly with the distance traveled, but it starts with a fixed charge.

## Step 1: Understanding the Cost Function
The cost function can be represented as \(C = 1.50 + 0.60d\), where \(C\) is the cost in pounds and \(d\) is the distance in miles. This function indicates that when \(d = 0\), \(C = 1.50\), meaning there's a fixed charge of £1.50 regardless of the distance traveled.

## 2: Analyzing the Graph Options
- Option A: A graph starting on the positive horizontal axis and traveling horizontally right and upwards in a steep straight line. This doesn't match because the graph should start above the origin (due to the fixed charge) and increase linearly, not horizontally.
- Option B: A graph starting on the positive vertical axis and traveling horizontally right. This is incorrect because the cost increases with distance, so the graph should slope upwards, not remain horizontal.
- Option C: A graph starting at the origin and traveling in a straight line right and upwards. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fixed charge; the graph should start above the origin.
- Option D: A graph starting at a point on the positive vertical axis and traveling horizontally right and upwards in a straight line. This option correctly represents a linear relationship starting with a positive intercept (the fixed charge), which matches the cost function.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of a fixed charge and a variable charge. They might choose Option C (20%) because they don't account for the fixed charge properly, or Option B (30%) because they see the vertical intercept but don't consider the increase with distance. Option D (30%) might be chosen by those who recognize the need for a starting point and an increase. Option A (20%) seems less likely due to its horizontal component.
- **Basic:** Students here understand basic concepts but might still struggle with applying them to graphs. They might choose Option D (60%) because they see the graph starts at a positive value (fixed charge) and increases linearly. Option C (20%) might still be appealing to some who forget the fixed charge. Options A and B are less likely (10% each).
- **Proficient:** These students are more likely to accurately interpret the equation and graph. They should predominantly choose Option D (80%) because it accurately represents a linear relationship with a positive intercept. Options A, B, and C might attract 5%, 5%, and 10% respectively, due to careless errors or misunderstanding.
- **Advanced:** At this level, students are expected to have a deep understanding. The vast majority should choose Option D (90%), with minimal consideration for the other options (A=2.5%, B=2.5%, C=5%).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=2.5% B=2.5% C=5% D=90%
