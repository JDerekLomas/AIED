## Step 1: Understand the question
The question requires students to multiply two terms from the brackets \((x+5)(x-3)\) that are indicated by arrows, specifically \(+5\) and \(-3\). The operation is \(5 \times -3\).

## 2: Identify the correct answer
The correct calculation for multiplying \(5\) and \(-3\) is \(5 \times -3 = -15\). So, the correct answer is B) \(-15\).

## 3: Consider common misconceptions
A common misconception might involve forgetting to apply the negative sign or misinterpreting the operation. However, this question directly tests the multiplication of two numbers with different signs, which is a fundamental concept.

## 4: Analyze the difficulty level
Given that the question directly points to the terms \(+5\) and \(-3\) and asks for their product, it's relatively straightforward. The context does not introduce any additional complexity that might trigger a misconception beyond the basic operation.

## 5: Predict student responses by ability level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic multiplication or adding/subtracting negative numbers. They might choose A) \(+2\) (incorrectly adding 5 and -3), C) \(-8\) (miscalculating the product), or even D) \(+15\) (ignoring the negative sign). The correct answer, B) \(-15\), might be challenging for them to achieve.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should understand basic multiplication and the rules for negative numbers. They are likely to get the correct answer, B) \(-15\), but some might still make careless mistakes, choosing A, C, or D.
- **Proficient:** These students are expected to consistently apply mathematical rules correctly. They should overwhelmingly choose B) \(-15\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts with ease. They will also choose B) \(-15\) but are less likely to consider incorrect options.

## 6: Estimate percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (simple addition mistake), B=40% (getting it right by chance or understanding), C=15% (another type of calculation error), D=15% (ignoring the negative).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** A=2%, B=95%, C=2%, D=1%.

## 7: Format the response
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
