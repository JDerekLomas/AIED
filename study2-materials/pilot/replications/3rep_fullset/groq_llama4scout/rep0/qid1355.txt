To approach this question, let's break down the concepts involved and analyze the potential for student errors based on common misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding Rounding to Significant Figures and Decimal Places
Rounding to significant figures involves looking at the number of significant digits a number should have, starting from the leftmost non-zero digit. Rounding to decimal places involves looking at the position of the decimal point and rounding to a specified number of digits after the decimal point.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom says \( 0.03456 \) rounded to \( 2 \) significant figures is \( 0.03 \). When rounding to 2 significant figures, we look at the third significant figure. If it's 5 or more, we round up; if it's less than 5, we round down. Here, \( 0.03456 \) has 4 significant figures when written as is. The first significant figure is 3, and the second is 4. The third significant figure is 5, which means we round up the second significant figure. So, \( 0.03456 \) to 2 significant figures is indeed \( 0.034 \) (or \( 3.4 \times 10^{-2} \)), not \( 0.03 \), making Tom incorrect.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie says \( 0.03456 \) rounded to \( 2 \) decimal places is \( 0.03 \). Rounding to 2 decimal places means looking at the third decimal place. If it's 5 or more, we round up the second decimal place; if it's less than 5, we leave it as is. For \( 0.03456 \), rounding to 2 decimal places gives \( 0.03 \) because the third decimal place is 4, which is less than 5. So, Katie is correct.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the basic concepts of rounding. They might not understand the difference between significant figures and decimal places. Given the confusion, they might incorrectly choose options based on a lack of understanding. Let's assume A=30% (thinking Tom could be right because it seems simpler), B=20% (Katie seems right because .03456 to 2 decimal places does end in a small number), C=10% (not understanding how to apply either rule correctly), D=40% (completely unsure).

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic rounding but might mix up significant figures and decimal places. They might see Tom's statement as potentially right due to a superficial understanding but are more likely to understand Katie's. So, A=20%, B=40%, C=15%, D=25%.

- **Proficient**: These students understand both concepts but might still make careless mistakes. They should recognize Tom's error and Katie's correctness. Thus, A=5%, B=80%, C=5%, D=10%.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to get it right immediately, recognizing Tom's mistake and Katie's correctness. So, A=0%, B=90%, C=5%, D=5%.

## 5: Formatting the Response
Given the above analysis and to fit the required format:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
