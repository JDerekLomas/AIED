To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it may pose.

The question involves a regular hexagon and a square joined on one side, with the angle between them labeled \( a \). The internal angles of a regular hexagon are \( 120^{\circ} \) each, and the internal angles of a square are \( 90^{\circ} \) each.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the size of angle \( a \), which is the external angle to the square and the internal angle supplement to the hexagon's angle at the point of joining.

## 2: Calculating Angle \( a \)
The angle at the corner of the square is \( 90^{\circ} \), and the angle at the corner of the regular hexagon is \( 120^{\circ} \). The angle \( a \) is the angle between the side of the square and the side of the hexagon. To find \( a \), we can consider that the full circle is \( 360^{\circ} \), but directly, \( a = 360^{\circ} - 90^{\circ} - 120^{\circ} \) is not the right approach since \( a \) is not the angle that completes the full turn with the internal angles of the hexagon and square.

## 3: Correct Approach
The internal angle of the hexagon is \( 120^{\circ} \) and that of the square is \( 90^{\circ} \). The angle \( a \) can be found by subtracting the internal angle of the hexagon from \( 180^{\circ} \) (since \( a \) and the \( 120^{\circ} \) angle of the hexagon form a straight line) and then considering the square's contribution or directly: \( a + 120^{\circ} + 90^{\circ} = 360^{\circ} \) because they form a complete rotation.

## 4: Solving for \( a \)
Given that, \( a = 360^{\circ} - 120^{\circ} - 90^{\circ} = 150^{\circ} \).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic geometry. They might incorrectly assume \( a \) is simply \( 90^{\circ} \) or \( 120^{\circ} \) without understanding how angles around a point add to \( 360^{\circ} \). Option C (\( 150^{\circ} \)) seems unlikely to be chosen by many as they might not perform the calculation correctly. A=20%, B=30%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic geometric shapes but might make calculation errors. They are more likely to choose C (\( 150^{\circ} \)) if they understand the concept but might still struggle with the arithmetic. A=10%, B=15%, C=60%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve the problem, understanding both the geometry and the arithmetic. They are likely to choose C (\( 150^{\circ} \)) correctly. A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will not only solve the problem correctly but also understand why the other options are incorrect. They are very likely to choose C (\( 150^{\circ} \)). A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 6: Formatting the Response
Given the analysis:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
