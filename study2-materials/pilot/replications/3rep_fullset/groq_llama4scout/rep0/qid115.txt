## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to express a movement of "three left and five down" in vector notation. The vector notation given is \( \left(\begin{array}{c}\triangle \\ \bigcirc\end{array}\right) \), and we need to determine what should replace \( \triangle \) for a left and down movement.

## 2: Vector Notation Basics
In vector notation, moving left is represented by a negative number (since right is positive), and moving down is also represented by a negative number (since up is positive). Therefore, moving three units to the left is -3, and moving five units down is -5.

## 3: Applying to the Given Problem
The vector \( \left(\begin{array}{c}\triangle \\ \bigcirc\end{array}\right) \) represents a movement where \( \triangle \) is the horizontal component (left/right) and \( \bigcirc \) is the vertical component (up/down). For "three left and five down," \( \triangle \) should be -3 (since left is negative) and \( \bigcirc \) should be -5 (since down is negative).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
A common misconception could be that students might not correctly apply the sign convention (left and down being negative). However, the specificity of the question ("three left and five down") and the standard convention in maths for representing directions might minimize errors for those familiar with vector notation.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding vector notation and the sign conventions. They might incorrectly assume "left" and "down" are positive or simply not understand how to apply them. So, A=40% ( straightforward but incorrect positive), B=20% (correct but needs understanding of negative), C=20% (incorrect, confusing with down), D=20% (correct understanding of down but not application).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a grasp of basic concepts but might still make errors due to not fully understanding the implications of negative values in vector notation. A=20%, B=60% (correct understanding that left is -ve), C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Students here are expected to have a solid understanding of vector notation and its conventions. A=5%, B=80% (correct), C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to get it right without hesitation. A=0%, B=90%, C=0%, D=10%.

## 6: Adjusting Predictions
Given the clarity of the question and standard conventions in mathematics education:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
