## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to expand the expression \(6(2-3p)\). This is a fundamental algebraic skill that involves distributing the 6 across the terms inside the parentheses.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Answer
To expand \(6(2-3p)\), we apply the distributive property:
\[6(2-3p) = 6 \times 2 - 6 \times 3p = 12 - 18p\]
So, the correct answer is \(12 - 18p\), which corresponds to option C.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect distribution or signs. For example, some students might incorrectly distribute the 6 or forget to change the sign of the term when multiplying by a negative number. However, in this case, the operation is straightforward: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) and \(6 \times -3p = -18p\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly apply the distributive property or make sign errors. Options A (\(8-18p\)) and B (\(2-18p\)) could be tempting if students incorrectly distribute or start with an incorrect number. Option D (\(18p-6\)) suggests a misunderstanding of both distribution and possibly the order of operations or signs.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to understand the concept of distribution but could miscalculate. The correct answer, C (\(12-18p\)), should be within their reach, but they might be tempted by A or B due to simple arithmetic errors.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to handle algebraic expansions confidently. They should accurately distribute the 6 and manage the signs correctly, leading them to choose C (\(12-18p\)).

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to not only choose the correct answer but also do so quickly and confidently, as this type of question is well within their skill level.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the fundamental concept being tested, even students at lower ability levels should have a good chance of getting it right if they've had basic algebra instruction.

- **Below Basic:** A=20% (simple mistake in calculation), B=15% (another simple error), C=50% (surprisingly, they might get it right through luck or basic understanding), D=15% (misunderstanding of distribution and signs).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=2%, C=92%, D=1%.
- **Advanced:** A=2%, B=1%, C=96%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=92% D=1%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%
