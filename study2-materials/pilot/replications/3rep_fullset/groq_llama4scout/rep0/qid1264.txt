To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's consider the nature of the question and the common misconceptions or challenges students might face.

The question requires students to understand how to calculate the total amount of money Sara and Rhys have, given that Rhys has 3 times as much as Sara. The calculations provided in the options need to be evaluated to determine which one would not give the correct total.

## Step 1: Understand the Correct Calculation
First, let's determine the correct calculation for the total amount of money they have. Sara has \( £ 2.79 \), and Rhys has 3 times as much as Sara, which is \( 3 \times £ 2.79 = £ 8.37 \). Therefore, together they have \( £ 2.79 + £ 8.37 = £ 11.16 \).

## 2: Evaluate Each Option
- Option A: \( £ 2.79 \times 4 = £ 11.16 \). This calculates Sara's amount plus 3 times Sara's amount (which is Rhys' amount), effectively \( £ 2.79 + £ 8.37 \).
- Option B: \( (£ 2.79 \times 3) + £ 2.79 = £ 8.37 + £ 2.79 = £ 11.16 \). This directly calculates Rhys' amount and adds Sara's amount.
- Option C: \( £ 2.80 \times 4 - £ 0.04 \). Calculating this: \( £ 2.80 \times 4 = £ 11.20 \), then \( £ 11.20 - £ 0.04 = £ 11.16 \). This also gives the correct total.
- Option D: \( £ 2.79 \times 3 = £ 8.37 \). This only calculates Rhys' amount, not the total.

## 3: Identify the Incorrect Calculation for the Total
Option D only gives Rhys' amount, not the total amount they have altogether. Thus, it's the calculation that would not find the answer to the question asked.

## 4: Analyze by Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the question or performing basic calculations. They might choose any option without fully understanding the implications. Given the straightforward nature of calculating totals and the fact that D directly doesn't answer the "altogether" question, we might expect:
  - A=20% (some might see the multiplication and addition implied)
  - B=20% (understanding addition and multiplication)
  - C=20% (appreciating the approximation)
  - D=40% (not realizing it doesn't give the total)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make more conceptual errors. They should see that D doesn't give the total:
  - A=30%
  - B=30%
  - C=25%
  - D=15%

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of mathematical operations and should easily identify D as not giving the total:
  - A=25%
  - B=25%
  - C=25%
  - D=25%

- **Advanced:** Advanced students should quickly recognize the correct and incorrect calculations, with a strong understanding of which directly answers the question:
  - A=10%
  - B=10%
  - C=10%
  - D=70% might be too high; more realistically, D should be recognized as incorrect, so let's adjust expectations considering the error is quite obvious: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85% seems too high for "advanced" given they should know better, so adjusting: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%

However, adjusting for realistic student performance and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic:** A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
- **Basic:** A=20% B=25% C=20% D=35%
- **Proficient:** A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
- **Advanced:** A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=20% D=35%
proficient: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
