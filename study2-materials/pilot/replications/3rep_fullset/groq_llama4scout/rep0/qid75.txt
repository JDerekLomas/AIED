## Step 1: Understand the question
The question provides the area of a rectangle as \(8 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\), with the base labeled as \(x\) and the height labeled as \(x^2 + 9\). The area of a rectangle is given by base times height, so we have \(x(x^2 + 9) = 8\). This equation needs to be solved for \(x\), and an iterative method is given: \(x_{n+1}=\frac{8}{9}-\frac{x^{3}_{n}}{9}\). We are also given \(x_0 = 0\).

## 2: Solve the equation directly for comparison
First, let's try to solve \(x(x^2 + 9) = 8\) directly: \(x^3 + 9x - 8 = 0\). This is a cubic equation, which can be challenging to solve directly without a hint towards rational roots or application of the cubic formula.

## 3: Consider the iterative method
The iterative method provided is \(x_{n+1}=\frac{8}{9}-\frac{x^{3}_{n}}{9}\). Let's start with \(x_0 = 0\):
- \(x_1 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0^3}{9} = \frac{8}{9}\)

## 4: Iterate to find \(x\)
To find \(x_1\) to \(x_n\), we continue iterating:
- \(x_1 = \frac{8}{9} \approx 0.8889\)
- For \(x_2\): \(x_2 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{(0.8889)^3}{9}\)
- Calculating \(x_2\): \(x_2 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0.7034}{9} \approx \frac{8}{9} - 0.0782 \approx 0.8889 - 0.0782 = 0.8107\)

## 5: Further iteration
Let's calculate \(x_3\):
- \(x_3 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{(0.8107)^3}{9}\)
- \(x_3 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0.5329}{9} \approx \frac{8}{9} - 0.0592 \approx 0.8889 - 0.0592 = 0.8297\)

## 6: More iteration for precision
Calculating \(x_4\):
- \(x_4 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{(0.8297)^3}{9}\)
- \(x_4 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0.5714}{9} \approx 0.8889 - 0.0635 = 0.8254\)

## 7: Final iteration for \(x_5\)
- \(x_5 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{(0.8254)^3}{9}\)
- \(x_5 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0.5613}{9} \approx 0.8889 - 0.0624 = 0.8265\)

## 8: Assess convergence
After a few iterations, \(x\) converges to approximately \(0.826\) to \(3\) decimal places.

## 9: Evaluate student performance
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the iterative process or solving the cubic equation and are likely to make significant errors. They might not even attempt iterations or understand the context. Option A seems closest to our calculation but considering their likely struggles, they might pick an option not directly calculated or make a mistake in calculation. Given the direct calculation isn't straightforward without iteration, A=30%, B=20%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the basic concept but struggle with precision or the iterative method. They might get close but not accurately compute iterations. A=40%, B=25%, C=25%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to follow the iterative method and achieve a good approximation. They are likely to get close to \(0.826\). A=60%, B=20%, C=15%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should easily solve or closely approximate \(x\) and are less likely to make errors in calculation. A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.

The best answer is A.
