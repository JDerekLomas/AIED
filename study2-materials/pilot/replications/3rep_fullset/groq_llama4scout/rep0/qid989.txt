## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the perimeter of a composite shape made from rectangles. The shape consists of three rectangles forming a step structure with specific dimensions given: the base is 23m long, the total vertical height is 22m, the top part's horizontal width is 6m, the first step's horizontal width is 7m, the bottom rectangle's vertical height is 5m, and the top rectangle's vertical height is 8m.

## 2: Identifying Key Dimensions
To calculate the perimeter, we need to identify all the lengths of the sides. The base of the shape is 23m, and the top is 6m. The vertical heights of the two parts are 5m and 8m, making the total height 13m, but the question states the total vertical height of the shape is 22m, which seems to be a mistake in the problem statement since the heights given (5m and 8m) add up to 13m. However, we can still calculate the perimeter using the given dimensions.

## 3: Calculating the Perimeter
The perimeter (P) of the composite shape can be calculated by adding all the outer sides. The horizontal sides are 23m (bottom) and 6m (top). The vertical sides are 5m (bottom part), 7m (middle part), and 8m (top part) but we need to consider the configuration: the 5m and 8m are the heights of the rectangles, and there are two more vertical segments on the sides which are 22m (total height) but distributed as 5m and 8m for the rectangles' heights. The correct approach is to add the lengths of all outer sides. 
- The bottom horizontal side is 23m.
- The top horizontal side is 6m.
- The vertical sides are 22m (total height), so there are two 22m segments but they are divided into parts that match the rectangle heights.

## 4: Correct Calculation
To find the perimeter, correctly add the lengths:
- Bottom: 23m
- Top: 6m
- Left side: 22m (since it's the total height)
- Right side: 22m (total height)
The correct calculation is: $23 + 6 + 22 + 22 = 73m$. However, it seems there was an error in my detailed step-by-step calculation based on provided and inferred dimensions. The accurate dimensions to consider for perimeter calculation directly from the figure are:
- Two vertical segments of 22m total height,
- A base of 23m,
- A top of 6m,
and the other horizontal segment which can be inferred to make the shape complete.

## 5: Re-evaluating Dimensions and Calculation
Given:
- Base = 23m
- Top horizontal length = 6m
- Total height = 22m
- The step lengths are 7m and 6m (making 13m total horizontal length for the steps, but the base is 23m).
The lengths of the sides are:
- Horizontal: 23m and 6m
- Vertical: Two sides of 22m.

## 6: Accurate Perimeter Calculation
The perimeter $P = 23 + 6 + 22 + 22 = 73m$. Let's assume a mistake in my detailed calculation steps and directly evaluate the options with common sense:
Given the total lengths and typical errors, let's assess student responses.

## 7: Student Response Prediction
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with adding multiple lengths and could easily make calculation errors. Option D seems too low, and without precise calculation, they might pick an answer that's not directly calculable from given numbers or seems reasonable (e.g., A, B, or C).
- **Basic**: These students would likely attempt to add the sides but might make simple arithmetic errors. They could reasonably choose A, B, or C, depending on their calculation accuracy.
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately calculate or have a good sense of the perimeter. If they made a precise calculation or used the figure correctly, they should get close to or exactly $73m$, but since that's not an option, they might choose the closest or make an educated guess.
- **Advanced**: These students would likely calculate accurately and might notice any discrepancies in given data. They'd likely choose the correct answer if calculated correctly or reason through any anomalies.

## 8: Final Predictions
Given the correct calculation seems to not match provided options directly and assuming a miscalculation in steps:
The closest or a likely correct answer based on typical student errors and calculation would guide predictions.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=5%
