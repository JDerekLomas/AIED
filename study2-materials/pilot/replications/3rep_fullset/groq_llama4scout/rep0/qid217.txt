To solve the equation \(0.15 = 0.5p\), we first isolate \(p\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.5.

## Step 1: Divide both sides by 0.5 to solve for \(p\).
\[p = \frac{0.15}{0.5}\]

## 2: Perform the division.
\[p = 0.3\]

## 3: Compare the solution to the given options.
The correct solution \(p = 0.3\) matches option C.

## 4: Analyze the question for potential misconceptions or traps.
The question is straightforward, requiring simple division to solve for \(p\). There's no obvious trap that would lead students to commonly held misconceptions in algebra or decimals.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic division, especially with decimals. They might not know how to divide 0.15 by 0.5, or they might make calculation errors. Option C (correct answer) might be challenging for them to identify. A=20% (random guess), B=20% (incorrect), C=40% (correct but potentially by chance or simple recall), D=20% (incorrect).
- **Basic:** Students at this level can perform basic operations but might still make errors with decimals or fractions. They are more likely to get the correct answer but might be tempted by obviously incorrect options. A=10%, B=20%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with decimals and algebraic manipulations. They are likely to solve the equation correctly. A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong foundation and are less likely to make simple arithmetic errors. They will easily solve the equation. A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 6: Format the predictions.
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
- **basic:** A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
