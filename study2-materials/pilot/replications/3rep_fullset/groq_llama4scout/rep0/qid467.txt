To tackle this, let's break down the question and the potential pitfalls for students at different levels.

The question involves sharing a profit in a given ratio and understanding the difference in amounts received by two individuals. The ratio given is \(9:5\), and Bill gets \(£72\) more than Mischa. Let's denote the total parts of the ratio as \(9 + 5 = 14\) parts.

## Step 1: Understanding the Ratio and Difference
The difference in parts between Bill and Mischa is \(9 - 5 = 4\) parts, which corresponds to \(£72\).

## 2: Calculating the Value of One Part
To find out the total amount they received, first, we need to determine the value of one part of the ratio. Since 4 parts equal \(£72\), one part equals \(£72 / 4 = £18\).

## 3: Finding the Total Amount Received
The total number of parts is 14, so the total amount received is \(14 \times £18 = £252\).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Student Errors
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with ratios and setting up equations. They might not understand how to use the given difference to solve the problem or might not even attempt to solve it with ratios.
- **Basic:** Basic level students might understand the concept of ratios but could struggle with applying it to find the total amount or might make calculation errors.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students should be able to solve this problem with ease, understanding the ratio, calculating the value of one part, and then the total.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will likely solve this quickly and accurately, possibly using algebraic methods or ratio properties efficiently.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
Given the solution is \(£252\), let's predict:
- **Below Basic:** Might guess or not attempt, so A=20%, B=20%, C=30%, D=30% (wild guesses).
- **Basic:** May struggle with calculation or setting up the problem, so A=10%, B=30%, C=40%, D=20%.
- **Proficient:** Should mostly get it right, some might make calculation errors, so A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Will likely get it right, so A=0%, B=5%, C=90%, D=5%.

## 6: Adjusting for Realistic Percentages
Adjusting for a more realistic scenario where the question is understood but might have calculation errors:
- **Below Basic:** A=10% B=15% C=35% D=40%
- **Basic:** A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
- **Proficient:** A=2% B=5% C=85% D=8%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=2% C=95% D=3%

The best answer is C. 
below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=35% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=85% D=8%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=95% D=3%
