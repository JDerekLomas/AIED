## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question provides the probability of choosing a strawberry sweet as 0.8 and asks for the probability of choosing an orange sweet. The probabilities of choosing strawberry, orange, and blackcurrant sweets must sum to 1.

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception could be that if one outcome has a high probability (like 0.8 for strawberry), the other outcomes must share the remaining probability equally or that there's not enough information to determine the probabilities of the other outcomes.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A (\( \frac{1}{3} \)) suggests an equal probability for orange and blackcurrant sweets, which would be incorrect without knowing the specific distribution.
- Option B (0.1) and Option C (0.2) suggest specific probabilities for the orange sweet without justification.
- Option D (Impossible to know) might seem correct because we don't know the probability of choosing a blackcurrant sweet, but actually, we can deduce the combined probability for orange and blackcurrant sweets.

## 4: Solving the Question
Given that the probability of choosing a strawberry sweet is 0.8, the combined probability of choosing an orange or a blackcurrant sweet is \(1 - 0.8 = 0.2\). Without specific information about the blackcurrant sweets, we cannot directly calculate the probability of choosing an orange sweet.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students might not understand probabilities add up to 1 or might not see the implication of a given probability on others. They might choose A (20%), B (10%), or C (20%) out of misunderstanding or guesswork. D seems likely because it reflects a lack of understanding of how probabilities work together. So, below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%.
- **Basic:** These students understand basic probability concepts. They might realize that without the probability of the blackcurrant sweet, they can't directly calculate the orange sweet's probability. So, they might lean towards D. Basic understanding should lead them to see that A, B, and C assume information not given. So, basic: A=10% B=5% C=10% D=75%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students know that probabilities must add to 1. They should recognize that the probability of choosing an orange sweet cannot be determined without more information about the blackcurrant sweets. Thus, proficient: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the probability concepts but also any implications of given numbers. They would quickly see that with the strawberry sweet's probability being 0.8, the rest (0.2) is shared between orange and blackcurrant, but without more info, the exact probability for orange can't be known. So, advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=10% D=75%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
