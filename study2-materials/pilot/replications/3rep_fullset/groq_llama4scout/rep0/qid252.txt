To approach this question, let's analyze what it's testing and how students at different levels might respond.

The question provides a quadratic equation in the form of \( y = (x - 3)(x - 5) \) and asks for the \( x \)-intercepts, which are the points where the curve crosses the \( x \)-axis. At these points, \( y = 0 \). 

## Step 1: Understanding the task
To find where the curve intercepts the \( x \)-axis, students need to set \( y = 0 \) and solve for \( x \). This means solving \( 0 = (x - 3)(x - 5) \).

## 2: Solving the equation
Solving \( 0 = (x - 3)(x - 5) \) gives two solutions: \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 5 \), because for the product of \( (x - 3) \) and \( (x - 5) \) to be zero, either \( (x - 3) = 0 \) or \( (x - 5) = 0 \). This leads to the \( x \)-intercepts being \( (3, 0) \) and \( (5, 0) \).

## 3: Analyzing the options
- Option A: \( (3, 5) \) - Incorrect because it suggests a single point that is not on the \( x \)-axis.
- Option B: \( \begin{array}{c}(3,0) \\ \text { and } \\ (5,0)\end{array} \) - Correct, as it accurately represents the \( x \)-intercepts.
- Option C: \( \begin{array}{c}(-3,0) \\ \text { and } \\ (-5,0)\end{array} \) - Incorrect, suggesting the roots are \( -3 \) and \( -5 \), not \( 3 \) and \( 5 \).
- Option D: \( \begin{array}{c}(3,5) \\ \text { and } \\ (-3,-5)\end{array} \) - Incorrect, mixing up the nature of \( x \)-intercepts and suggesting points not on the \( x \)-axis.

## 4: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with solving quadratic equations or understanding what \( x \)-intercepts are. They might choose A or D due to misunderstanding the concept of \( x \)-intercepts or not being able to solve the equation correctly. Option B seems unlikely for this group. C might be chosen by those confusing the signs. 
  - A: 30% (confusing intercept with a point on the curve)
  - B: 20% (correct but challenging for this level)
  - C: 25% (incorrectly solving or misunderstanding)
  - D: 25% (misunderstanding intercepts and coordinates)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying it correctly. They are more likely to recognize the need to solve for \( x \) when \( y = 0 \) but might make careless mistakes.
  - A: 15% 
  - B: 60% (recognize the equation form and solve)
  - C: 15% 
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient**: These students understand quadratic equations and can solve them. They are likely to get the correct answer.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 85%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only solve the equation correctly but also understand the implications of the solutions. They are likely to choose the correct option without hesitation.
  - A: 2%
  - B: 95%
  - C: 1%
  - D: 2%

The best answer is below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
