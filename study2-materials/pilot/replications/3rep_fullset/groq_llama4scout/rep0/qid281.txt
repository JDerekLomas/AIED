## Step 1: Understand the problem context
The problem provides a rectangle with an area of \(8 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\), a base labelled \(x\), and a height labelled \(x^2 + 9\). The area of a rectangle is given by base times height, so we have \(x(x^2 + 9) = 8\). However, instead of solving this equation directly for \(x\), we're given an iterative formula \(x_{n+1} = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{x_n^3}{9}\) and told that \(x_0 = 0\). We need to find \(x_1\).

## 2: Calculate \(x_1\)
To find \(x_1\), we substitute \(x_0 = 0\) into the formula: \(x_1 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0^3}{9} = \frac{8}{9}\).

## 3: Analyze the question for potential misconceptions or traps
The question seems straightforward as it directly involves substituting into a given formula. However, the context of finding \(x\) from the area of a rectangle and then using an iterative method to approximate \(x\) could potentially confuse students if they are not careful. The key here is that \(x_0 = 0\) leads to a simple calculation for \(x_1\).

## 4: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the formula and substitution. They might not correctly calculate \(x_1\) or might choose an answer based on misunderstanding the formula. Given \(x_0 = 0\), \(x_1 = \frac{8}{9}\) directly, which is a simple calculation. So, they might get it right by chance or struggle significantly.
- **Basic**: Basic level students should be able to handle simple substitutions and calculations. They are likely to calculate \(x_1\) correctly as \(\frac{8}{9}\) given \(x_0 = 0\).
- **Proficient**: Proficient students will easily calculate \(x_1 = \frac{8}{9}\) and understand the process. They are less likely to make errors in this straightforward calculation.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will not only calculate \(x_1\) correctly but also understand the iterative process and its implications. They will have no issues with this question.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the straightforward nature of calculating \(x_1\) with \(x_0 = 0\), most students across all levels should be able to get it right, assuming they can handle basic algebra and substitution.

- **Below Basic**: A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5% (Most might get it right by direct calculation or guesswork)
- **Basic**: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2% (Most will calculate it correctly)
- **Proficient**: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1% (Almost all will get it right)
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5% (Very high accuracy expected)

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
