To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and understanding of mathematical operations, particularly subtraction, among students at different ability levels.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The statement made by Miran suggests a misunderstanding of the commutative property of subtraction. In mathematics, the commutative property states that the order of the numbers does not change the result for addition and multiplication, i.e., \(a + b = b + a\) and \(a \times b = b \times a\). However, subtraction and division are not commutative, meaning \(a - b \neq b - a\) and \(a \div b \neq b \div a\).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A suggests Miran is correct because subtraction is commutative, which is mathematically incorrect.
- Option B suggests Miran is incorrect because subtraction is commutative, which is also incorrect as it misstates the property of subtraction.
- Option C suggests Miran is correct because subtraction is not commutative, which aligns with mathematical fact but not Miran's statement.
- Option D suggests Miran is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative, which is mathematically correct and directly addresses Miran's claim.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the properties of mathematical operations. They might believe Miran is correct simply because they don't understand the concept of commutativity in subtraction (A = 40%, B = 10%, C = 20%, D = 30%).
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding but might still hold misconceptions. They are likely to recognize that subtraction is not commutative but might be confused by Miran's statement (A = 30%, B = 15%, C = 15%, D = 40%).
- **Proficient:** Students here have a solid grasp of mathematical operations and their properties. They should easily identify Miran's mistake and understand that subtraction is not commutative (A = 10%, B = 5%, C = 5%, D = 80%).
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the mathematical concepts but can also apply them to complex problems. They would quickly dismiss Miran's statement as incorrect due to the non-commutative nature of subtraction (A = 5%, B = 0%, C = 0%, D = 95%).

## 4: Refining Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- Below_basic: A=50% B=5% C=10% D=35%
- Basic: A=25% B=10% C=15% D=50%
- Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
- Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=50% B=5% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=25% B=10% C=15% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
