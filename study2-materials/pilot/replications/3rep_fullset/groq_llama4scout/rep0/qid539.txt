## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks for the length of each side of a regular octagon with a total perimeter of \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \). A regular octagon has 8 equal sides.

## 2: Identify the correct formula
The perimeter \( P \) of a polygon is given by \( P = n \times s \), where \( n \) is the number of sides and \( s \) is the length of one side. For a regular octagon, \( n = 8 \). Given \( P = 12 \mathrm{~cm} \), we can rearrange the formula to find \( s \): \( s = \frac{P}{n} = \frac{12}{8} = 1.5 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 3: Analyze the options
- A: \( 1.5 \mathrm{~cm} \) is the correct answer based on the calculation.
- B: \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \) would imply a perimeter of \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \mathrm{~cm} \), not \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \).
- C: \( 96 \mathrm{~cm} \) would imply a perimeter of \( 8 \times 96 = 768 \mathrm{~cm} \), not \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \).
- D: \( \text{Not enough information} \) is incorrect because we have enough information to calculate the side length.

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception might involve misunderstanding the relationship between perimeter and side length or miscalculating the number of sides. However, this question is straightforward: it directly tests the ability to apply a simple formula.

## 5: Predict student responses by ability level
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with division or understanding the concept of perimeter. They might choose \( B \) or \( C \) due to miscalculation or not understanding the question. \( D \) might also be chosen due to confusion. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 30\% \), \( D = 20\% \).
- **Basic**: Students here should understand the basics of geometry and division. They are likely to calculate \( 12 \div 8 \) correctly but might be tempted by obviously incorrect answers. \( A = 60\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 10\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve the problem and choose \( A \). They are less likely to be misled by the incorrect options. \( A = 85\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will almost certainly choose \( A \) and might even check their work. \( A = 95\% \), \( B = 2\% \), \( C = 2\% \), \( D = 1\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
