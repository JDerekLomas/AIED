## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a pie chart showing the meal choices of guests at a wedding and asks which formula would correctly calculate the number of people who chose pork, given that there were 540 people at the wedding.

## 2: Analyzing the Pie Chart
The pie chart is a circle, representing 360 degrees, and it is divided into parts labeled for different meal choices: Beef (150 degrees), Pork (40 degrees), Other (80 degrees), and Vegetarian (which can be calculated as 360 - 150 - 40 - 80 = 90 degrees, since a right angle is 90 degrees).

## 3: Identifying the Correct Formula
To find the number of people who chose pork, we need to determine what fraction of the total circle (360 degrees) the pork section represents and then apply that fraction to the total number of people (540). The fraction of the circle that chose pork is \( \frac{40}{360} \). To find the number of people who chose pork, we multiply this fraction by the total number of people: \( \frac{40}{360} \times 540 \).

## 4: Evaluating the Options
- Option A: \( \frac{360}{40} \times 540 \) is incorrect because it inverts the fraction and does not correctly represent the proportion of people choosing pork.
- Option B: \( \frac{40}{360} \times 540 \) matches our identified correct formula.
- Option C: \( \frac{40}{540} \times 360 \) incorrectly calculates the proportion of people to the total degrees in a circle, which does not make sense in this context.
- Option D: "You need more information" is incorrect because we have all the necessary information to solve the problem.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding fractions of a circle and applying them to real-world scenarios. They might be tempted by options that seem simple or familiar, even if incorrect. Option A could appeal due to its simplicity, and Option D might be chosen by those who feel uncertain. \( A = 30\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 30\% \).
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of fractions and percentages. They might still make errors but are more likely to choose the correct option or recognize that they need to use the fraction of the circle that represents pork. \( A = 10\% \), \( B = 60\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 10\% \).
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of mathematical concepts, including fractions and proportions. They are likely to choose the correct option with confidence. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 80\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them quickly and accurately. They are very likely to choose the correct option. \( A = 2\% \), \( B = 90\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 3\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
