## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a simple geometry problem where two angles meet on a straight line, with one angle labeled as 48 degrees and another angle further down the straight line labeled as 30 degrees. The task is to find the size of angle \( n \).

## 2: Identifying the Relevant Geometric Principle
The key principle here is that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.

## 3: Analyzing the Potential for Misconceptions
A common misconception could be that students might add the two given angles (48 degrees and 30 degrees) and then either add or subtract this sum from 180 degrees incorrectly, or they might not account for the fact that the 30-degree angle is not directly supplementary to the 48-degree angle in a way that would form angle \( n \) without considering their positions.

## 4: Calculating the Correct Answer
To find \( n \), we need to subtract the sum of the other two angles from 180 degrees because \( n \) and the other two angles form a straight line when combined. So, \( n = 180^{\circ} - 48^{\circ} - 30^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} - 78^{\circ} = 102^{\circ} \).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric concepts or might not understand how angles relate on a straight line. They could choose any option randomly or based on a misunderstanding. Given the simplicity of the calculation, \( C = 102^{\circ} \) seems like it should be appealing to those who grasp the basic concept but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. \( D = 312^{\circ} \) seems unlikely as it's far beyond 180 degrees, but \( A = 132^{\circ} \) and \( B = 142^{\circ} \) could be tempting if students incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the concept. Let's predict: below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
- **Basic**: Students at this level should understand the basic concept that angles on a straight line add to 180 degrees. They might still make simple arithmetic mistakes. Given \( n = 102^{\circ} \), let's predict: basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve the problem with minimal chance of error. The correct answer \( C = 102^{\circ} \) should be chosen by most. Let's predict: proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only know the concept but also apply it accurately without hesitation. The correct answer should be a near certainty. Let's predict: advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
- basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
