To approach this question, let's analyze the function machine and the statements made by Tom and Katie.

The function machine has an input of \(m + 2\) and an output of \(3m + 2\).

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Statement
Tom says the function could be \(+2m\). To verify, let's apply this function to the input \(m + 2\):
- Input: \(m + 2\)
- Function: \(+2m\)
- Output: \((m + 2) + 2m = 3m + 2\)

This matches the given output, so Tom's statement is correct.

## 2: Analyze Katie's Statement
Katie says the function could be \(\times 3\). Applying this function to the input \(m + 2\):
- Input: \(m + 2\)
- Function: \(\times 3\)
- Output: \(3(m + 2) = 3m + 6\)

This does not match the given output of \(3m + 2\), so Katie's statement is incorrect.

## 3: Determining Student Responses
Given the analysis:
- Tom is correct.
- Katie is incorrect.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level

### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with algebraic expressions and substituting into functions. They might not fully understand how to test Tom's and Katie's claims properly.
- A: Only Tom: 40% (some might agree with Tom but not fully understand why Katie is wrong)
- B: Only Katie: 20% (might mistakenly agree with Katie)
- C: Both Tom and Katie: 15% (not understanding that Katie's function doesn't work)
- D: Neither is correct: 25% (completely unsure or incorrectly assessing both)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra but might make simple errors in substitution or not fully grasp the implications of each function.
- A: Only Tom: 60% (can see Tom's function works but might be unsure about Katie)
- B: Only Katie: 15% (less likely to be convinced by Katie's incorrect claim)
- C: Both Tom and Katie: 10% (some might still be confused)
- D: Neither is correct: 15% (a few might doubt both)

### proficient
Students at this level should be able to easily substitute and assess both claims.
- A: Only Tom: 80% (clearly see Tom's function works and Katie's does not)
- B: Only Katie: 5% (unlikely to mistakenly support Katie)
- C: Both Tom and Katie: 5% (very few would incorrectly think both are right)
- D: Neither is correct: 10% (a small percentage might have doubts)

### advanced
Students at this level should have a deep understanding and easily evaluate both functions.
- A: Only Tom: 90% (confidently agree with Tom and dismiss Katie)
- B: Only Katie: 0% (unlikely to consider Katie correct)
- C: Both Tom and Katie: 0% (no chance of thinking both are correct)
- D: Neither is correct: 10% (very few might have an alternative perspective)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
