## Step 1: Understand the question and the chart
The question presents a bar chart showing the number of cups of tea and coffee sold over 4 days. We need to determine how many cups of coffee were sold on Tuesday.

## 2: Analyze the chart for Tuesday's coffee sales
The bar for coffee on Tuesday reaches 5 small boxes above 40. Since the vertical scale has 10 small boxes between 0 and 10, each small box represents 1 unit. Therefore, 5 small boxes above 40 represent an additional 5 units.

## 3: Calculate Tuesday's coffee sales
To find the total number of cups of coffee sold on Tuesday, we add the 40 cups (the baseline from which the 5 small boxes are counted) to the 5 additional cups, which equals 45 cups.

## 4: Consider potential misconceptions and difficulties
A common misconception could be misreading the scale or not accurately counting the boxes. However, the chart clearly shows the scale and the position of the coffee bar for Tuesday, making it relatively straightforward.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with reading the chart, understanding the scale, or performing the simple addition. They might choose A (50) if they incorrectly count the boxes or assume a wrong scale, B (38) if they misunderstand the question or misread the chart significantly, C (12) if they only consider the small boxes without the baseline, or D (45) if they accurately read and calculate.
- **Basic:** Students here should be able to read the chart and perform basic calculations. They are likely to get it right (D=45) but might be tempted by A (50) if they miscount the boxes or B (38) and C (12) due to errors in calculation or chart reading.
- **Proficient:** These students should accurately read the chart and calculate the correct answer. They are likely to choose D (45) with high accuracy, and mistakes would be minimal.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level will almost certainly choose D (45) as they will accurately interpret the chart and perform the calculation without error.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each option at different ability levels
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the clear information provided by the chart:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (overestimation), B=10% (underestimation), C=15% (misunderstanding of scale), D=55% (correct, but might be through luck).
- **Basic:** A=5% (miscount), B=5% (error), C=5% (miscalculation), D=85% (correct).
- **Proficient:** A=1% (rare miscount), B=1% (rare error), C=1% (rare miscalculation), D=97% (correct).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no errors), B=0% (no errors), C=0% (no errors), D=100% (correct).

The best answer is D.
