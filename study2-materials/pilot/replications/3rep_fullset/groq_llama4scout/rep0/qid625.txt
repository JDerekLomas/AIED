To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 4 \% \) as a fraction is...., let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks to convert \( 4 \% \) into a fraction. \( 4 \% \) means 4 per 100, which directly translates to \( \frac{4}{100} \). Simplifying \( \frac{4}{100} \) gives \( \frac{1}{25} \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
- A common misconception might be to confuse percentages with fractions or decimals directly, leading to incorrect conversions.
- Another might be not simplifying the fraction.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( \frac{2}{5} \) is incorrect because \( \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \) or \( 40 \% \), not \( 4 \% \).
- B: \( \frac{4}{10} \) is incorrect because \( \frac{4}{10} = 0.4 \) or \( 40 \% \), not \( 4 \% \).
- C: \( \frac{1}{25} \) is correct because \( \frac{1}{25} = 0.04 \) or \( 4 \% \).
- D: \( \frac{1}{4} \) is incorrect because \( \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \) or \( 25 \% \), not \( 4 \% \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions. They might see \( 4 \% \) and think of it as \( \frac{4}{10} \) (option B) due to a misunderstanding of place value, or they might not know how to convert percentages to fractions. So, they could be misled by options that seem simpler or more familiar. \( B = 40\% \), \( D = 30\% \), \( A = 15\% \), \( C = 15\% \).
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might make simple errors. They are likely to recognize \( 4 \% \) as \( \frac{4}{100} \) but might not simplify it correctly or might confuse it with other fractions. \( B = 30\% \), \( D = 25\% \), \( A = 20\% \), \( C = 25\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students understand percentages and fractions well. They should easily convert \( 4 \% \) to \( \frac{4}{100} \) and simplify it to \( \frac{1}{25} \). \( C = 80\% \), \( A = 10\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can quickly convert and simplify. They are less likely to make errors. \( C = 95\% \), \( A = 3\% \), \( B = 1\% \), \( D = 1\% \).

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%
- basic: A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25%
- proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
- advanced: A=3% B=1% C=95% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=3% B=1% C=95% D=1%
