To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the calculation and common misconceptions or challenges students might face.

The question asks to express \(6\) out of \(25\) as a percentage. This involves a simple calculation: \( \frac{6}{25} \times 100\% \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculation
First, let's do the calculation: \( \frac{6}{25} \times 100\% = 0.24 \times 100\% = 24\% \). 

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve incorrect conversion or a wrong operation. However, given the straightforward nature of this calculation, the main error might come from a miscalculation or converting the fraction to a decimal incorrectly.

## 3: Analyzing Option Attractiveness
- Option A: \(12\%\) seems too low.
- Option B: \(30\%\) is close but still seems a bit high.
- Option C: \(62.5\%\) seems much too high.
- Option D: \(24\%\) matches our calculation.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the division or converting to a percentage. They might incorrectly calculate or choose an option that seems "reasonable" but is incorrect. \( A = 20\%, B = 40\%, C = 20\%, D = 20\% \).
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a foundational understanding but might still make simple calculation errors. \( A = 10\%, B = 30\%, C = 10\%, D = 50\% \).
- **Proficient:** Students here are expected to perform the calculation correctly with minimal errors. \( A = 5\%, B = 5\%, C = 5\%, D = 85\% \).
- **Advanced:** These students are likely to get it right without any issues. \( A = 0\%, B = 0\%, C = 0\%, D = 100\% \).

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Given the straightforward calculation, most students, even at the basic level, should be able to get it right or have a good chance of selecting the correct answer. The numbers provided don't particularly trigger common misconceptions strongly, suggesting a higher success rate than for more tricky questions.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=10% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
