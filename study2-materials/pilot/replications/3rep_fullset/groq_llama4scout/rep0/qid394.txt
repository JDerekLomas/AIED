## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for a given maths question about the volume of a cuboid.

## 2: Recall the formula for the volume of a cuboid
The volume \(V\) of a cuboid is given by the formula \(V = l \times w \times h\), where \(l\) is the length, \(w\) is the width, and \(h\) is the height.

## 3: Apply the formula to the given cuboid
Given the dimensions of the cuboid are 10cm, 4cm, and 5cm, we can calculate the volume as \(V = 10 \times 4 \times 5 = 200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\).

## 4: Analyze the options
- Option A: \(19 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\)
- Option B: \(50 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\)
- Option C: \(200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\)
- Option D: \(220 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\)

## 5: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer is Option C: \(200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\), as calculated.

## 6: Consider common misconceptions or errors
A common error might be adding the dimensions or multiplying some but not all of them, or using incorrect units. However, given the straightforward nature of this question with simple numbers, the main error would likely be a calculation mistake.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might not understand the concept of volume or how to calculate it. They might add the numbers (\(10 + 4 + 5 = 19\)), leading to A=60%, or make a wild guess. B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students here understand the concept but might struggle with calculations or applying the formula correctly. They could mistakenly use \(10 \times 4 = 40\) and then \(40 \times 5 = 200\), but some might get confused, possibly leading to B=30% (if they mistakenly use one of the dimensions incorrectly or forget one), A=20%, C=40%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to calculate the volume correctly but might double-check. Hence, C=90%, with small chances of A=2%, B=5%, D=3% due to calculation errors.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to not only calculate correctly but also understand the context and units. Therefore, C=98%, with very small chances for other options, A=0.5%, B=0.5%, D=1%.

## 8: Refine predictions based on realistic student errors
Given the simplicity of the calculation and the dimensions provided, most students, even at lower levels, are likely to get it right or make simple calculation errors.

## 9: Finalize predictions
- **below_basic**: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
- **basic**: A=10% B=20% C=65% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=65% D=5%
proficient: A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%
