## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question asks students to rewrite a quadratic equation in the form \( y = (x + p)^2 + q \) and find the value of \( p \). The given quadratic equation is \( y = x^2 - 2x - 3 \). A common misconception when completing the square is incorrectly identifying the value of \( p \) and \( q \) or mishandling the process of completing the square.

## 2: Complete the square for the given quadratic equation to find \( p \).
To complete the square for \( y = x^2 - 2x - 3 \), we take the coefficient of \( x \), which is \( -2 \), divide it by 2 (getting \( -1 \)), and then square it (getting \( 1 \)). We add and subtract 1 inside the expression: \( y = (x^2 - 2x + 1) - 1 - 3 \), which simplifies to \( y = (x - 1)^2 - 4 \). Thus, comparing this to \( y = (x + p)^2 + q \), \( p = -1 \).

## 3: Analyze the difficulty of the question and potential student errors.
The question seems straightforward for students familiar with completing the square. However, students might struggle if they incorrectly apply the formula or misunderstand the process. The equation given is \( y = x^2 - 2x - 3 \), and to match the form \( y = (x + p)^2 + q \), students must correctly identify \( p \) and \( q \) by completing the square.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may not understand how to complete the square or may not even attempt it, potentially leading to random guesses or an inability to solve the problem. They might choose any option randomly, but given the nature of the question, B (\( -1 \)) is the correct answer, so they might lean towards incorrect options more frequently.
- **Basic:** Students at this level may attempt to complete the square but could make errors in the process, such as incorrectly calculating \( p \) or \( q \). They might choose A (\( 1 \)) or C (\( 4 \)) or D (\( -4 \)) if they misunderstand the completion of squares.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level should be able to complete the square accurately and identify \( p = -1 \) correctly. They are less likely to make errors.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to not only complete the square accurately but also understand the implications of different forms of quadratic equations. They should easily identify \( p = -1 \).

## 5: Estimate percentages for each ability level.
- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%

The best answer is B. 

Therefore, the response is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
