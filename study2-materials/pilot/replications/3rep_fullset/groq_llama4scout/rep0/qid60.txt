To tackle this question, let's first understand the concept being tested and the potential pitfalls. The task is to simplify the mixed fraction \(3 \frac{7}{21}\). A common misconception students might have is not simplifying the fractional part properly or not recognizing that the whole number part can be adjusted when simplifying.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task requires converting the mixed fraction \(3 \frac{7}{21}\) into its simplest form. This involves simplifying the fraction \(\frac{7}{21}\) and then combining it with the whole number part, if necessary.

## 2: Simplifying the Fraction
The fraction \(\frac{7}{21}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7. So, \(\frac{7}{21} = \frac{1}{3}\).

## 3: Combining with the Whole Number Part
The mixed fraction \(3 \frac{7}{21}\) can then be written as \(3 \frac{1}{3}\) because \(\frac{7}{21}\) simplifies to \(\frac{1}{3}\).

## 4: Evaluating the Options
- Option A: \(1 \frac{16}{21}\) seems incorrect because it doesn't match our simplification.
- Option B: \(1 \frac{1}{3}\) suggests a misunderstanding in keeping the whole number part.
- Option C: \(3 \frac{1}{3}\) matches our correct simplification.
- Option D: "Cannot be simplified" is incorrect because \(3 \frac{7}{21}\) can indeed be simplified.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic fraction simplification. They might not simplify \(\frac{7}{21}\) correctly or might not know how to handle mixed numbers. Expect a high chance of choosing incorrect options due to lack of understanding. \(A=20\%\), \(B=30\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=30\%\).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in simplification or in handling the mixed number. They might choose \(B\) or \(D\) due to miscalculation or misunderstanding. \(A=10\%\), \(B=40\%\), \(C=30\%\), \(D=20\%\).
- **Proficient:** These students understand fractions and mixed numbers well. They should easily simplify \(\frac{7}{21}\) to \(\frac{1}{3}\) and correctly identify \(3 \frac{1}{3}\) as the answer. \(A=5\%\), \(B=10\%\), \(C=80\%\), \(D=5\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of the concepts and should find this question straightforward. They are likely to choose \(C\) with minimal error. \(A=0\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=95\%\), \(D=5\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
