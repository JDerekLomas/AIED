To answer this question, let's consider the potential for errors based on the structure of the question and the common misconceptions students might have.

The question involves calculating the total cost for Heena's visit to a theme park. The cost consists of an entry fee of \( £8 \) and \( £3 \) for every ride. Heena goes on \( 5 \) rides.

## Step 1: Understand the Calculation
The total cost can be calculated as follows: 
- Entry fee: \( £8 \)
- Cost for rides: \( 5 \) rides \( \times £3 \) per ride \( = £15 \)
- Total cost: \( £8 + £15 = £23 \)

## 2: Identify Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not adding the entry fee to the cost of the rides or miscalculating the total cost of the rides. However, this question seems straightforward.

## 3: Analyze the Options
- Option A: \( £55 \)
- Option B: \( £15 \) (only the cost of the rides)
- Option C: \( £11 \) ( possibly \( £8 + £3 \))
- Option D: \( £23 \) (correct answer)

## 4: Consider Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic or misunderstand the question entirely. They might choose B (\( £15 \)) because they only consider the rides and ignore the entry fee, or they might pick A (\( £55 \)) if they mistakenly multiply \( £3 \) by \( 5 \) and then by \( £8 \) in a confused manner. 
  - A: 20% 
  - B: 40% 
  - C: 20% 
  - D: 20%

- **Basic:** Students here should understand basic addition and multiplication but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to get it right or make simple errors.
  - A: 5% 
  - B: 20% 
  - C: 10% 
  - D: 65%

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of arithmetic operations and are less likely to make mistakes on straightforward questions like this.
  - A: 1% 
  - B: 5% 
  - C: 2% 
  - D: 92%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the math but are also less prone to simple errors. They would likely all get this right.
  - A: 0% 
  - B: 0% 
  - C: 0% 
  - D: 100%

## 5: Provide the Response
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=10% D=65%
proficient: A=1% B=5% C=2% D=92%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
