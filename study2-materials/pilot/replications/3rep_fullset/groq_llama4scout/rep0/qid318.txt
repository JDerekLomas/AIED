To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or areas of difficulty.

The quadratic formula is given by \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) for an equation in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For the equation \(3x^2 + 2x - 5 = 0\), we have \(a = 3\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = -5\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Quadratic Formula
The correct substitution into the quadratic formula would thus be \(x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4(3)(-5)}}{2(3)}\). This matches option C.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve incorrect substitution of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) into the formula, particularly with the signs. For example, some students might forget to change the sign of \(b\) when substituting into \(-b\), or they might incorrectly handle the \(4ac\) part, especially if \(c\) is negative.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( -2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{2^{2}-4(3)(-5)}}{2(3)} \) incorrectly places the \(-2\) outside the fraction.
- Option B: \( 2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{2^{2}-4(3)(-5)}}{2(3)} \) not only incorrectly keeps \(b = 2\) positive but also places it outside the fraction.
- Option C: \( \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^{2}-4(3)(-5)}}{2(3)} \) correctly represents the quadratic formula with \(a = 3\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = -5\).
- Option D: \( \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{2^{2}-4(3)(-5)}}{2(3)} \) incorrectly uses \(b = 2\) instead of \(-b = -2\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with substituting into the formula and understanding the significance of negative signs. They might choose options that reflect common mistakes, such as A or B, due to not understanding the formula's structure. Option C would likely be chosen by a smaller percentage, around 20-30%, with A and B being more popular due to straightforward errors. D might also be considered by some, leading to: below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple algebraic mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the correct formula structure but might struggle with the substitution, leading to: basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students are familiar with the quadratic formula and can substitute correctly. The error rate would decrease significantly, with most students choosing C: proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%.
- **Advanced:** For advanced students, the question is straightforward, and they would likely all choose the correct option or make very minimal errors, if any: advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
