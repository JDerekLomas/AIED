To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the cost of rulers, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question states: "Twelve rulers cost \( 96 p \). How much do five rulers cost?"

First, let's identify the correct method to solve this problem. To find the cost of one ruler, we divide the total cost by the number of rulers: \( 96 p / 12 = 8 p \) per ruler. Then, to find the cost of five rulers, we multiply the cost of one ruler by five: \( 8 p \times 5 = 40 p \).

The correct answer is B) \( 40 p \).

Now, let's consider the potential misconceptions or errors:

- A) \( 89 p \) seems to be a random or incorrect calculation.
- B) \( 40 p \) is the correct answer.
- C) \( 8 p \) might be chosen by students who only calculate the cost of one ruler and stop.
- D) \( £ 4.80 \) seems to result from a miscalculation, possibly confusing pence with pounds or making a calculation error.

Let's predict the performance based on ability levels:

### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with division and multiplication, or they might not understand the question fully. They could choose any option based on incorrect calculations or guesses.
- A=20% (random guess or incorrect calculation)
- B=20% (managed to calculate correctly or guess)
- C=30% (only calculated for one ruler)
- D=30% (miscalculation or confusion with units)

### basic
Students at this level have basic numeracy skills but might make simple errors. They are likely to attempt calculations but could get stuck.
- A=15% (incorrect calculation)
- B=60% (correct calculation)
- C=15% (stopped at one ruler's cost)
- D=10% (more complex error)

### proficient
Students at this level are generally confident with basic calculations and can apply them to solve problems.
- A=5% (careless mistake)
- B=80% (correct calculation)
- C=5% (unlikely to stop without calculating for five rulers)
- D=10% (more significant miscalculation)

### advanced
Students at this level are very confident and accurate in their calculations. They are less likely to make errors.
- A=0% (very unlikely to make such a mistake)
- B=90% (correct calculation)
- C=0% (understood the need for multiplication)
- D=10% (though unlikely, could consider this a distractor for very high achievers)

So, adjusting for a more realistic prediction and considering common misconceptions:

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
