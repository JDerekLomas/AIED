To solve this, let's first determine the correct movement from point \( \mathrm{V} \) to point \( \mathrm{W} \). Point \( \mathrm{V} \) is at \( (2, 2) \) and point \( \mathrm{W} \) is at \( (-3, -1) \).

The horizontal movement is from \( 2 \) to \( -3 \), which is a movement of \( -3 - 2 = -5 \) units. Since it's to the left, we say "Left \( 5 \) squares".

The vertical movement is from \( 2 \) to \( -1 \), which is a movement of \( -1 - 2 = -3 \) units. Since it's downwards, we say "down \( 3 \) squares".

So, the correct movement is "Left \( 5 \) squares, down \( 3 \) squares", which corresponds to option B.

Now, let's analyze the potential for errors based on ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding coordinates, calculating differences, or even with the concept of moving in a grid based on coordinate changes. They might incorrectly calculate the differences or misunderstand the directions. 
  - A: Left \( 4 \) squares, down \( 3 \) squares: This could appeal to those who miscount the horizontal distance.
  - B: This is the correct answer.
  - C: Right \( 5 \) squares, up \( 3 \) squares: This would be chosen by those who not only miscount but also misunderstand the direction of movement.
  - D: Left \( 5 \) squares, up \( 3 \) squares: This could be chosen by those who correctly assess the horizontal movement but incorrectly assess the vertical movement.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of coordinates but might still make simple arithmetic errors or misunderstand the question.
  - They are more likely to get it right but might be tempted by obvious wrong answers.

- **Proficient**: These students understand coordinates well and are less likely to make arithmetic errors. They should mostly choose the correct option.

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concept well but are also less likely to be misled by incorrect options.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic**: A=20% (miscalculate both), B=40% (some understanding but might get lucky), C=20% (misunderstand both directions), D=20% (miscalculate one direction).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=70%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=2%, D=3%.

Therefore:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2% D=3%
