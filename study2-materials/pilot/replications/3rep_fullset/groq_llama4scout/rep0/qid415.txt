## Step 1: Understanding the sequence and the claims
The sequence given is \(7n + 5\). Jo claims that \(149\) is a term in the sequence, and Paul claims that \(150\) is a term in the sequence. To verify their claims, we need to see if there are integer solutions for \(n\) that satisfy \(7n + 5 = 149\) and \(7n + 5 = 150\).

## 2: Checking Jo's claim
For Jo's claim, we set \(7n + 5 = 149\) and solve for \(n\).
\[7n + 5 = 149\]
\[7n = 144\]
\[n = 144 / 7\]
\[n = 20.57\]
Since \(n\) is not an integer, Jo's claim that \(149\) is a term in the sequence is incorrect.

## 3: Checking Paul's claim
For Paul's claim, we set \(7n + 5 = 150\) and solve for \(n\).
\[7n + 5 = 150\]
\[7n = 145\]
\[n = 145 / 7\]
\[n = 20.71\]
Since \(n\) is not an integer, Paul's claim that \(150\) is a term in the sequence is also incorrect.

## 4: Analyzing the question for potential misconceptions
The question requires students to understand that for a number to be a term in the sequence \(7n + 5\), it must be of the form \(7n + 5\) where \(n\) is an integer. A common misconception might involve not checking for integer solutions of \(n\) or misunderstanding how to apply the sequence formula. However, given that both claims are easily checked and found to be incorrect through simple division, the question may not trigger the typical misconceptions as much as it seems.

## 5: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand sequences or how to test if a number belongs to one. They might guess or not fully engage with the mathematical check. Given the straightforward nature of the calculations, even they might see that both divisions result in non-integers, but their approach might be haphazard. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 50\%\)
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and can perform simple calculations. They might correctly identify that both \(149\) and \(150\) do not yield integer \(n\) values but could be confused or make errors in calculation. \(A = 15\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 65\%\)
- **Proficient**: These students understand sequences and can solve for \(n\). They will likely correctly find that neither \(149\) nor \(150\) fits the sequence because \(n\) is not an integer in either case. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 85\%\)
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will quickly and accurately determine that neither claim is correct due to non-integer \(n\) values. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 0\%\), \(D = 100\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=5% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
