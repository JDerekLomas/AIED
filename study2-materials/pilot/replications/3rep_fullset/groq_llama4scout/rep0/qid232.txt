To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question.

The question revolves around understanding factors in algebraic expressions. Tom claims that \(3\) is a common factor of \(6x\) and \(9y\), and Katie claims that \(x\) is a common factor of \(6x\) and \(9y\).

## Step 1: Understanding Tom's Claim
Tom says \(3\) is a common factor. For \(6x = 3 \times 2x\) and \(9y = 3 \times 3y\), it's clear that \(3\) is indeed a factor of both expressions because it can be factored out from each.

## 2: Understanding Katie's Claim
Katie says \(x\) is a common factor. However, \(6x\) can be seen as \(x \times 6\), but \(9y\) cannot be factored into a product that includes \(x\) without knowing \(y\)'s relationship to \(x\). Thus, \(x\) is not a common factor of \(6x\) and \(9y\) unless \(y\) is a multiple of \(x\), which is not specified.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: Only Tom
- B: Only Katie
- C: Both Tom and Katie
- D: Neither is correct

## 4: Evaluating Student Understanding
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic concepts. They might not fully understand what a factor is or how it applies to algebraic expressions. Tom's statement could seem plausible because \(3\) is a number they know, but Katie's might confuse them because \(x\) is a variable. Expect a high percentage of errors here, with possibly D being a common guess due to confusion.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra. They should recognize \(3\) as a common factor easily. However, they might be tricked into thinking \(x\) could be a common factor because they see \(x\) in \(6x\), not realizing \(y\) doesn't have an \(x\) component. So, A might be a strong choice, with some possibly choosing D due to Katie's seemingly incorrect statement.
- **Proficient**: These students understand factors well and can apply them to algebraic expressions. They should easily see Tom is correct but Katie is not, because \(x\) isn't a factor of \(9y\). So, A should be the most popular choice here.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can likely see through both statements quickly. They'll confirm Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness due to the lack of \(x\) in \(9y\). Thus, A should still be the most chosen option, with minimal selection of other options.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some understand simple factor recognition), B=10% (misunderstand Katie's claim), C=20% (overestimate), D=30% (completely unsure or misinterpret both).
- **Basic**: A=60% (recognize Tom, struggle with Katie), B=20% (Katie seems plausible), C=10% (underestimate), D=10% (some still unsure).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (clearly understand Tom, not Katie), B=10% (less confusion), C=5% (rarely choose both), D=5% (very few misunderstand completely).
- **Advanced**: A=90% (confident in understanding), B=5% (extremely few errors), C=3% (almost never), D=2% (very rare complete misunderstandings).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
