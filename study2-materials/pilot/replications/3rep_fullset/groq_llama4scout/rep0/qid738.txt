## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question involves rotating a blue shape \( 90^{\circ} \) anticlockwise about the point \( (-2,2) \) and selecting the correct resulting shape from four options labeled A, B, C, and D.

## 2: Identifying Key Concepts
To solve this, students need to understand how to perform a \( 90^{\circ} \) anticlockwise rotation about a point not at the origin. The rotation matrix for this is \( \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \), but since the rotation is about \( (-2,2) \) and not the origin, students must translate the system to align the rotation point with the origin, apply the rotation, and then translate back.

## 3: Analyzing the Shapes
- The blue shape has vertices at \( (-3,5) \), \( (-3,4) \), \( (-2,4) \), \( (-2,3) \), and \( (-3,3) \).
- The rotation point is \( (-2,2) \).

## 4: Considering Student Errors
A common misconception is not properly accounting for the rotation point or misapplying the rotation transformation. Students might also struggle with visualizing the rotation or incorrectly translate the shapes.

## 5: Evaluating Option Difficulty
This question might be challenging because it requires a clear understanding of coordinate geometry transformations, specifically rotations about a point not at the origin. However, the shapes and their positions are designed to test understanding rather than computational complexity.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand or be able to apply rotation transformations accurately. They might choose based on visual inspection rather than calculation, leading to a higher chance of incorrect answers. Given the visual nature and the need for precise transformation, \( A=20\% \), \( B=20\% \), \( C=30\% \), \( D=30\% \).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might struggle with the rotation about a non-origin point. They might make calculation errors or misinterpret the transformation. \( A=10\% \), \( B=15\% \), \( C=35\% \), \( D=40\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts and can apply them. They might still make minor errors but are more likely to get it right. Assuming one option is clearly correct after accurate transformation, \( A=5\% \), \( B=5\% \), \( C=20\% \), \( D=70\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply transformations accurately and efficiently. They are less likely to make errors. \( A=0\% \), \( B=0\% \), \( C=5\% \), \( D=95\% \).

## 7: Identifying the Correct Answer
To rotate a point \( (x, y) \) \( 90^{\circ} \) anticlockwise about \( (-2, 2) \), first translate to \( (x+2, y-2) \), then apply \( (x', y') = (-y+2, x+2) \) or specifically for a \( 90^{\circ} \) rotation matrix, and translate back. For \( (-3,5) \), translating gives \( (-3+2, 5-2) = (-1,3) \), rotating gives \( (-3, -1) \), translating back \( (-3-2, -1+2) = (-5, 1) \), which matches shape D.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=35% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=20% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
