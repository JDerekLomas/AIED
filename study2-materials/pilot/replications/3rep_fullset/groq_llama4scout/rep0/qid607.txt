To approach this question, let's first analyze the methods proposed by Tom and Katie for finding \(40\%\) of an amount and then assess the correctness of their methods.

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Method
Tom suggests to find \(40\%\) of an amount, you divide by \(100\) and then multiply by \(4\). The general formula for finding \(x\%\) of an amount \(A\) is \(\frac{x}{100} \times A\). For \(40\%\), this becomes \(\frac{40}{100} \times A = 0.4 \times A\). Tom's method can be represented as \(\frac{40}{100} \times A = \frac{4}{10} \times A\), which simplifies to \(0.4 \times A\) or \(40\%\) of \(A\). Thus, Tom's method is correct.

## 2: Analyze Katie's Method
Katie suggests to find \(40\%\) of an amount, you divide by \(5\) and then multiply by \(2\). This can be represented as \(\frac{2}{5} \times A\). Since \(\frac{2}{5} = 0.4\), Katie's method also equals \(40\%\) of \(A\). Therefore, Katie's method is also correct.

## 3: Evaluate the Correctness of Statements
Given that both Tom and Katie's methods are mathematically equivalent to finding \(40\%\) of an amount, both are correct. This means the correct answer is that both Tom and Katie are correct.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding percentages and the operations involved. They might not fully grasp the methods proposed by Tom and Katie or might confuse the operations. However, given the simplicity of the question and the direct comparison of methods, a significant portion might still choose the correct answer or dismiss both as incorrect if they don't understand the calculations. 
  - A: 20% (some might think Tom is right but not Katie)
  - B: 15% (similar reasoning)
  - C: 40% (recognize both are correct or are guessing)
  - D: 25% (think neither is correct due to misunderstanding)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of percentages. They should be able to follow simple calculations and comparisons.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 60% (understand both methods are correct)
  - D: 20%

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of percentages and can easily evaluate the correctness of Tom and Katie's methods.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 80%
  - D: 10%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand percentages but can also quickly assess the validity of different mathematical operations and statements.
  - A: 2%
  - B: 2%
  - C: 90%
  - D: 6%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
