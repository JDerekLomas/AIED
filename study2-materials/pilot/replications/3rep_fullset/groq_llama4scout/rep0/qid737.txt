To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The question is: \(\sqrt{75} = n\sqrt{3}\). To solve for \(n\), students need to express \(\sqrt{75}\) in terms of \(\sqrt{3}\). 

## Step 1: Understand the task
Students need to simplify \(\sqrt{75}\) and express it as \(n\sqrt{3}\). Recognizing that \(75 = 25 \times 3\), and that \(\sqrt{25} = 5\), students can rewrite \(\sqrt{75}\) as \(\sqrt{25 \times 3} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{3} = 5\sqrt{3}\).

## 2: Identify the correct answer
From the simplification, it's clear that \(n = 5\), which corresponds to option A.

## 3: Consider potential misconceptions or errors
- A common misconception might involve not properly simplifying \(\sqrt{75}\) or incorrectly handling the square root of a product.
- Some students might mistakenly think \(\sqrt{75} = \sqrt{25} + \sqrt{3} = 5 + \sqrt{3}\), but this is not a choice provided.
- The options given are \(5\), \(25\), \(9\), and \(72\). 

## 4: Analyze each ability level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with square roots and simplifying expressions. They might not correctly simplify \(\sqrt{75}\) or might choose an option that seems "big" or appears related to the numbers given, like \(25\) or \(72\).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in simplification or might not recognize how to express \(\sqrt{75}\) in terms of \(\sqrt{3}\) directly. They could potentially choose \(25\) if they mistakenly think \(75 = 25 \times 3\) implies \(n=25\).
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to correctly simplify \(\sqrt{75}\) to \(5\sqrt{3}\) and thus choose \(A = 5\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should easily recognize the simplification and choose \(A = 5\). They might be less likely to consider incorrect options.

## 5: Estimate percentages based on understanding
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (some get it by chance or rough estimation), B=30% (think \(25\) is a factor), C=15% (random guess), D=15% (another random guess).
- **Basic:** A=60% (can simplify but might be a bit hesitant), B=25% (still some confusion with factors), C=10% (less likely), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Proficient:** A=85% (confident in simplification), B=10% (small chance of error), C=3% (unlikely), D=2% (very unlikely).
- **Advanced:** A=95% (very confident), B=3% (rare mistake), C=1% (extremely unlikely), D=1% (extremely unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
