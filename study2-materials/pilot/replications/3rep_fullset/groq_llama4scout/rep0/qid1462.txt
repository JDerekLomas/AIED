## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the cube root of 8, denoted as \( \sqrt[3]{8} \). This is a straightforward mathematical operation that involves finding a number that, when multiplied by itself twice (or cubed), equals 8.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Answer
The correct answer is the number that, when cubed, equals 8. Since \( 2^3 = 8 \), the correct answer is \( 2 \).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Errors
- Option A: \( 2 . \dot{6} \) suggests a repeating decimal, which might confuse students who are not sure about the exact value of \( \sqrt[3]{8} \) or mistakenly think it relates to a decimal representation rather than an integer.
- Option B: \( 4 \) could be a mistake if a student mistakenly thinks of \( 2^2 = 4 \) or simply squares 2 instead of cubing it.
- Option C: \( 64 \) seems unrelated directly to common misconceptions about cube roots and square roots, possibly arising from a confusion with \( 8^2 = 64 \).
- Option D: \( 2 \) is the correct answer.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
### below_basic:
At this level, students may struggle with basic mathematical operations and concepts. They might confuse the operation or not understand what a cube root is.
- A: \( 10\% \) (some might mistakenly think it's a decimal)
- B: \( 20\% \) (confusing with squaring)
- C: \( 30\% \) (possibly thinking of unrelated operations)
- D: \( 40\% \) (still, a significant portion might get it right due to simple recall)

### basic:
Students at this level have a grasp of basic mathematical concepts but might make simple errors.
- A: \( 5\% \) (less likely to consider decimals without context)
- B: \( 15\% \) (squaring instead of cubing)
- C: \( 10\% \) (less likely to confuse with \( 8^2 \))
- D: \( 70\% \) (most would know \( 2^3 = 8 \))

### proficient:
These students are comfortable with mathematical operations and less likely to make basic errors.
- A: \( 2\% \) (unlikely to consider this)
- B: \( 5\% \) (aware of the difference between squaring and cubing)
- C: \( 2\% \) (unlikely to confuse with other operations)
- D: \( 91\% \) (confident in their calculation)

### advanced:
Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less prone to errors.
- A: \( 1\% \) (very unlikely)
- B: \( 1\% \) (understand the operations well)
- C: \( 1\% \) (similarly unlikely)
- D: \( 97\% \) (almost certain to get it right)

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
- basic: A=5% B=15% C=10% D=70%
- proficient: A=2% B=5% C=2% D=91%
- advanced: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=10% D=70%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=2% D=91%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%
