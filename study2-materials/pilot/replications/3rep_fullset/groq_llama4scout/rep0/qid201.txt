To approach this question, let's analyze the definitions and implications of linear functions and vertical lines, and then consider how students at different ability levels might respond.

## Step 1: Understanding Linear Functions and Vertical Lines
A linear function is typically defined as a function that can be written in the form \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the slope of the line and \(b\) is the y-intercept. Both \(m\) and \(b\) are constants. A horizontal line, which is a special case of a linear function, has a slope of 0. Vertical lines, on the other hand, are defined as lines that have an equation of the form \(x = c\), where \(c\) is a constant. They do not fit the standard form of a linear function because they have undefined slope.

## 2: Analyzing the Given Functions
The functions given are \(y = 3\) and \(y = -2\). Both of these are horizontal lines because they have a constant \(y\) value for all \(x\). They can be considered linear functions with a slope of 0. On the other hand, they are not vertical lines because they do not have a constant \(x\) value.

## 3: Evaluating Tom's and Katie's Statements
- Tom says both functions are linear. Since both \(y = 3\) and \(y = -2\) can be expressed as \(y = 0x + 3\) and \(y = 0x - 2\) respectively, they are indeed linear with a slope of 0.
- Katie says both functions are vertical lines. This is incorrect because, as explained, both functions represent horizontal lines, not vertical lines.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic definitions. They might incorrectly identify linear functions or not understand the distinction between horizontal and vertical lines. Thus, they could mistakenly agree with Katie or disagree with both, but are less likely to accurately identify Tom as correct. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 30\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 40\%\)
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may not fully grasp the nuances. They might recognize \(y = 3\) and \(y = -2\) as lines but could confuse the types. They are more likely to agree with Tom but might be split on Katie. \(A = 60\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 10\%\)
- **Proficient:** These students understand linear equations and can identify horizontal and vertical lines. They should recognize both functions as linear and not vertical. \(A = 80\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 5\%\)
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts accurately. They will definitely recognize both as linear and not vertical. \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\)

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Given the understanding of the concepts and likely student responses:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
- basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
- advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
