## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question provides a table of values for the equation \(y = x^2 - x\) and asks to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = -7\).

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
The equation given is \(y = x^2 - x\). A common misconception could involve incorrect substitution or misunderstanding of the equation's form, such as confusing it with \(y = x^2 + x\) or \(y = x(x - 1)\) and then not applying it correctly.

## 3: Solving the Equation for \(x = -7\)
To find \(y\) when \(x = -7\), substitute \(x\) into the equation:
\[y = (-7)^2 - (-7)\]
\[y = 49 + 7\]
\[y = 56\]

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A straightforward substitution yields the correct answer, \(y = 56\), which corresponds to option D.
- A common error might be \(y = (-7)^2 - 7 = 49 - 7 = 42\), which corresponds to option A.
- Another potential error could be misunderstanding the negative sign, leading to \(y = (-7)^2 + 7 = 49 + 7 = 56\), which is actually correct, or \(y = -((-7)^2 - (-7)) = -(49 + 7) = -56\), corresponding to option B.
- The error \(y = -((-7)^2 + 7) = -(49 + 7) = -56\) seems plausible for some, but calculating \(y = x^2 - x\) directly is less prone to error than more complex expressions.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students here might struggle with substitution and calculation. They might incorrectly calculate or substitute, leading to a higher chance of errors like \(42\) (A) or misinterpreting the negative sign, resulting in \(y = -56\) (B) or \(y = -42\) (C). Given the simplicity of the calculation, \(A = 30\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 15\%\), \(D = 35\%\).
- **Basic**: At this level, students understand the equation but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. The calculation is straightforward, so errors might still occur. \(A = 15\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 70\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with the equation and substitution. The chance of error is low, mainly due to simple miscalculations. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 0\%\), \(D = 90\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students here are very confident and rarely make errors in such straightforward calculations. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 0\%\), \(D = 100\%\).
