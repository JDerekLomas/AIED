To approach this question, let's first understand what it's asking and then consider how students at different ability levels might respond.

The question provides a recursive formula for a sequence: \(x_{n+1}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{x_{n}+1}}\), and asks for the value of \(x_{2}\) given that \(x_{1}=0.5\).

## Step 1: Calculate \(x_{2}\)
To find \(x_{2}\), we substitute \(x_{1}=0.5\) into the formula:
\[x_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{0.5+1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.5}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \approx 0.8165\]

## 2: Evaluate the Answer Choices
- A: \(0.8164 \ldots\)
- B: \(0.6666 \ldots\)
- C: \(0.7419 \ldots\)
- D: Another answer

## 3: Consider Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting into the formula or calculating the square root. They might not even attempt to calculate \(x_{2}\) or could make significant errors. Given the calculation is not extremely complex, some might get it right by chance or using a calculator, but errors in calculation or conceptual understanding are likely. A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic mathematical operations but might not be fluent. They should be able to substitute into the formula and calculate \(x_{2}\) with some effort. Mistakes could occur in arithmetic. A=60%, B=15%, C=15%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand the formula and calculate \(x_{2}\) accurately with minimal effort. They might make minor arithmetic errors but should recognize the correct answer. A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to solve this efficiently and accurately. They should quickly identify the correct answer without miscalculation. A=95%, B=0%, C=0%, D=5%

## 4: Adjust for Realistic Expectations
Given the nature of the question and assuming students have access to calculators, even those at lower levels might manage to get close to the right answer or identify it among the choices.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
