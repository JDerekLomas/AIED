To approach this question, let's first analyze the transformation depicted and then consider how students at different levels of ability might perceive it.

## Step 1: Understanding the Transformation
The transformation maps shape A onto shape B. Shape A has coordinates (6,4), (4,4), and (4,5), while shape B has coordinates (-4,4), (-2,4), and (-2,5). This indicates a horizontal shift and possibly a reflection.

## 2: Identifying the Type of Transformation
To map A onto B, notice that the x-coordinates change from positive to negative and decrease in magnitude, while the y-coordinates remain the same. Specifically, the change from (6,4) to (-4,4) and from (4,4) to (-2,4) suggests a reflection across the y-axis because the x-coordinates change sign and are scaled appropriately.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: Reflection in the y-axis. This would change (x, y) to (-x, y), which matches the transformation from A to B.
- B: Reflection in the x-axis. This would change (x, y) to (x, -y), which does not match.
- C: Reflection in y = 1. This would be a horizontal reflection, not applicable here as the transformation seems to be across the y-axis.
- D: Reflection in x = 1. This option suggests a vertical reflection line at x = 1, which does not seem to apply directly here.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students might struggle to understand or visualize the transformation. They might incorrectly choose B (Reflection in x-axis) because they confuse the axes or choose D (Reflection in x=1) due to misunderstanding the concept of reflection lines. A=40%, B=30%, C=15%, D=15%.
- **Basic:** Basic students should have a grasp of coordinate geometry and reflections. They might still make mistakes but are more likely to choose A. A=60%, B=20%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are likely to understand reflections across axes and lines. They should predominantly choose A. A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to have a strong understanding of transformations. They should easily identify the transformation as a reflection in the y-axis. A=90%, B=2%, C=4%, D=4%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=4% D=4%
