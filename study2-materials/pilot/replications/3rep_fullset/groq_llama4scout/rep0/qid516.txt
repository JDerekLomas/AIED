## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question provides the gradient of a line as \(2\) and a point it passes through as \((1,1)\). It asks for the possible equation of this line from given options.

## 2: Identifying the Gradient and Point
The gradient (\(m\)) of the line is given as \(2\), and the point \((x_1, y_1)\) it passes through is \((1,1)\). The general equation of a line can be expressed as \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the gradient and \(b\) is the y-intercept.

## 3: Substituting Given Values
Substituting \(m = 2\) and the point \((1,1)\) into the equation \(y = mx + b\), we get \(1 = 2(1) + b\). Solving for \(b\), we find \(1 = 2 + b\), which simplifies to \(b = -1\).

## 4: Writing the Equation of the Line
With \(m = 2\) and \(b = -1\), the equation of the line is \(y = 2x - 1\).

## 5: Evaluating the Options
- Option A: \(y = 2x + 1\). If \(x = 1\), then \(y = 2(1) + 1 = 3\), which does not match the point \((1,1)\).
- Option B: \(y = x + 2\). If \(x = 1\), then \(y = 1 + 2 = 3\), which does not match the point \((1,1)\) and has a gradient of \(1\), not \(2\).
- Option C: \(y = 2x - 1\). If \(x = 1\), then \(y = 2(1) - 1 = 1\), which matches the point \((1,1)\) and has a gradient of \(2\).
- Option D: \(y = 2x\). If \(x = 1\), then \(y = 2(1) = 2\), which does not match the point \((1,1)\).

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand how to apply the gradient and point to find the equation of a line. They might randomly select an option or choose based on superficial recognition rather than calculation. Option A might seem plausible because it's a simple equation, but it doesn't fit. Option C is correct but requires calculation. Expect a spread but potentially more errors: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and can substitute values into an equation. They might still make mistakes in calculation or not fully understand the implications of gradient and point. They are more likely to identify C as correct but might be tempted by A: A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with the equation of a line and can accurately substitute given values. They should easily identify C as the correct answer with minimal error: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also manipulate equations with ease. They should have no trouble identifying the correct equation and would be less likely to consider incorrect options: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%
