To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \(0.03 \times 12\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to multiply \(0.03\) by \(12\). This is a straightforward multiplication problem involving decimals.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception when multiplying decimals is forgetting to consider the place value correctly. For example, some students might think of \(0.03\) as \(3\) and then multiply \(3 \times 12 = 36\), but then incorrectly place the decimal point, or they might not adjust their calculation to account for the decimal properly.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(0.036\)
- Option B: \(0.306\)
- Option C: \(0.36\)
- Option D: \(3.6\)

## 4: Calculating the Correct Answer
To calculate \(0.03 \times 12\), we can think of it as \(3 \times 10^{-2} \times 12 = 36 \times 10^{-2} = 0.36\). So, the correct answer is \(0.36\), which corresponds to option C.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication and decimal understanding. They might incorrectly calculate or place the decimal point. Option A (\(0.036\)) could be a result of \(0.03 \times 1.2\) or similar miscalculation. Option D (\(3.6\)) might result from adding or misplacing the decimal. Let's assume:
  - A: 30% (incorrect calculation)
  - B: 10% (miscalculation)
  - C: 30% (some might get it right by chance or simple calculation)
  - D: 30% (miscalculation)

- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp but might still struggle with decimal multiplication. 
  - A: 15%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 60% (most get it right or have a chance to)
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient**: These students understand decimal multiplication well.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 85%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very confident in their calculations.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 0%
  - C: 100%
  - D: 0%

## 6: Final Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=10% C=30% D=30%
- **basic**: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
