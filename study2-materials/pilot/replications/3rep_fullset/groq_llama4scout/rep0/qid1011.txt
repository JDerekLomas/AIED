To solve this, let's first understand the concept of reflecting a point in a line. The line of reflection is \(x = -1\). To reflect a point across the line \(x = -1\), we need to find the distance of the point's x-coordinate from the line \(x = -1\) and then move the same distance to the other side of \(x = -1\).

The point E is at \((3, 3)\). The distance from \(x = 3\) to \(x = -1\) is \(3 - (-1) = 4\). So, to reflect point E across \(x = -1\), we go 4 units to the left of \(x = -1\), which gives us \(x = -1 - 4 = -5\). The y-coordinate remains the same, so the reflected point of E is \((-5, 3)\).

Now, let's analyze the options with this correct answer in mind:

- A: \((-3, 3)\)
- B: \((-5, 3)\)
- C: \((3, -3)\)
- D: \((3, -5)\)

Given this is a reflection question and the numbers are relatively straightforward, we should consider how students at different levels might perform:

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to reflect a point across a vertical line \(x = -1\). This is a standard transformation in geometry.

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors
Common errors might include not changing the sign of the distance correctly when reflecting across a vertical line not on the y-axis or confusing the x and y coordinates.

## 3: Assessing Difficulty
The point E is at \((3,3)\), and the line of reflection is \(x = -1\). The correct reflection is \((-5, 3)\), which requires understanding that the distance from \(3\) to \(-1\) is \(4\), so \(4\) units to the left of \(-1\) is \(-5\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students might struggle with understanding reflections or calculating distances. They might not correctly apply the concept of reflection across a line not on the axis. Option B is the correct answer, but these students might choose A because they only move 2 units instead of 4, or they might not understand the concept at all and choose randomly.
- **Basic:** These students understand basic geometric transformations but might make simple calculation errors. They are likely to get the correct answer, B, but some might choose A due to miscalculation.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level are likely to understand reflections well and calculate correctly. They should mostly choose B.
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the concept but are also less likely to make careless errors. They should almost all choose B.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (due to simple miscalculation), B=40% (correct but through luck or partial understanding), C=10%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=70%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=10%, B=85%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced:** A=5%, B=90%, C=2%, D=3%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
