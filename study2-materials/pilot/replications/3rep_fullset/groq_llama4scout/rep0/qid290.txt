To address this question, let's first understand what Katie's theory is and what would disprove it. Katie's theory is that \(2n^{2} - 1\) is always positive. A counter-example to disprove this theory would be any value of \(n\) for which \(2n^{2} - 1 \leq 0\).

## Step 1: Understand the condition for a counter-example
A counter-example would be a value of \(n\) where \(2n^{2} - 1 \leq 0\). This means \(2n^{2} \leq 1\), which simplifies to \(n^{2} \leq \frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \(n\) must be between \(-\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\) and \(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\), not including \(-\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\) and \(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\) themselves if we are looking for strict inequality, but since we need \(2n^{2} - 1 \leq 0\), values of \(n\) in this range could serve as counter-examples.

## 2: Evaluate option A
Option A is \(2\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2} - 1 = 2\left(\frac{9}{16}\right) - 1 = \frac{9}{8} - 1 = \frac{9}{8} - \frac{8}{8} = \frac{1}{8}\). Since \(\frac{1}{8}\) is positive, option A does not serve as a counter-example.

## 3: Evaluate option B
Option B is \(2(0.5)^{2} - 1 = 2\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) - 1 = \frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{1}{2}\). Since \(-\frac{1}{2}\) is negative, option B serves as a counter-example.

## 4: Evaluate option C
Option C is \(2(-2)^{2} - 1 = 2(4) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\). Since 7 is positive, option C does not serve as a counter-example.

## 5: Evaluate option D
Option D is \(2(-1)^{2} - 1 = 2(1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\). Since 1 is positive, option D does not serve as a counter-example.

## 6: Consider student understanding and potential misconceptions
Students might struggle with substituting negative numbers or decimals into the equation and evaluating the result, especially if they are not confident with their algebraic skills or handling negative numbers.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with substituting into the formula and evaluating expressions, especially with fractions or decimals. They may not accurately calculate or may misinterpret the question. Option B, being a straightforward calculation, might still be within their reach to calculate correctly, but errors could be common across all options.

- **Basic:** Students here would likely understand the need to substitute and calculate but might make computational errors or not fully understand the implications of a negative result. They might correctly identify option B as a counter-example but struggle with explaining why or calculating other options accurately.

- **Proficient:** These students should be able to accurately substitute and evaluate expressions, understanding that a negative result or zero would disprove the theory. They should easily identify option B as a counter-example and rule out the others based on their calculations.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students would not only quickly identify option B as a counter-example but also potentially explain why the other options do not work, showing a deeper understanding of the algebraic expression and its behavior.

## 8: Assign percentages
Given the clarity of the question and the simplicity of calculations required, especially with option B providing a clear and straightforward counter-example:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20% (Many might pick an option by chance or based on a miscalculation)
- **Basic:** A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15% (Students start to show understanding but may still make errors)
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5% (Most understand and calculate correctly)
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2% (High accuracy with option B and quick elimination of other options)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3
