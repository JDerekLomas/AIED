To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the task and the common misconceptions or difficulties students might face when factorising quadratic expressions.

The expression given is \(p^{2} + 5p + 6\). This is a quadratic expression that can be factorised into the product of two binomials. The general form of factorising a quadratic expression \(ax^{2} + bx + c\) into \((x + m)(x + n)\) requires finding \(m\) and \(n\) such that \(m \times n = ac\) and \(m + n = b\). For the given expression, \(a = 1\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = 6\), so we need to find two numbers that multiply to \(6\) and add to \(5\). These numbers are \(2\) and \(3\) because \(2 \times 3 = 6\) and \(2 + 3 = 5\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to factorise \(p^{2} + 5p + 6\). Given the numbers \(2\) and \(3\) satisfy the conditions, the correct factorisation is \((p + 2)(p + 3)\), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors
- A common error might be finding two numbers that multiply to \(6\) but do not add to \(5\), leading to incorrect factorisations like \((p + 6)(p + 1)\) or \((p + 6)(p - 1)\), which correspond to options B and C, respectively.
- Another potential error could be assuming the expression does not factorise (option D), although this seems less likely for a straightforward quadratic like \(p^{2} + 5p + 6\).

## 3: Assessing Difficulty by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle to even attempt factorisation or might not understand the concept. They could randomly select an option or choose D, thinking it doesn't factorise. However, given the simplicity of the numbers involved, some might stumble upon A by trial and error.
- **Basic:** Students here should have a grasp of basic algebra and might be able to attempt factorisation. However, they might not systematically find the correct factors, leading to a higher chance of selecting B or C.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily identify that \(2\) and \(3\) are the numbers needed and thus select A. They are less likely to make simple arithmetic errors that lead to B, C, or D.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only easily factorise the expression but also quickly recognise that A is the correct answer, with minimal chance of selecting incorrect options.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (by chance or simple insight), B=20%, C=20%, D=30% (not understanding or giving up).
- **Basic:** A=60%, B=20%, C=15%, D=5% (starting to understand but prone to errors).
- **Proficient:** A=85%, B=10%, C=4%, D=1% (good understanding with minor errors).
- **Advanced:** A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1% (strong understanding with very few errors).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
