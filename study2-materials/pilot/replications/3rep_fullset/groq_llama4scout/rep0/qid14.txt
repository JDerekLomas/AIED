## Step 1: Understand the question and the recurrence relation
The question provides a recurrence relation \(x_{n+1} = 5 - \frac{1}{x_n}\) and asks for the solution to \(x = 5 - \frac{1}{x}\) to 2 decimal places, given a starting value of \(x_1 = 2\). This essentially asks students to find the fixed point of the recurrence relation.

## 2: Solve the equation \(x = 5 - \frac{1}{x}\) for \(x\)
To find the fixed point, we solve the equation:
\[x = 5 - \frac{1}{x}\]
Multiplying every term by \(x\) to clear the fraction:
\[x^2 = 5x - 1\]
Rearranging into a standard quadratic form:
\[x^2 - 5x + 1 = 0\]
Using the quadratic formula, where \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = 1\):
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]
\[x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}\]
\[x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 4}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{21}}{2}\]
Calculating the roots:
\[x = \frac{5 \pm 4.582575}{2}\]
So, the two solutions are:
\[x_1 = \frac{5 + 4.582575}{2} = \frac{9.582575}{2} = 4.7912875\]
\[x_2 = \frac{5 - 4.582575}{2} = \frac{0.417425}{2} = 0.2087125\]

## 3: Determine the relevant solution
Given that the recurrence relation and the starting value \(x_1 = 2\) are provided, and we are looking for a solution to 2 decimal places, we consider \(x = 4.7912875\) as the relevant solution because it is the positive and larger root which would be approached by the sequence given its starting point and nature.

## 4: Evaluate answer choices
- A: \(4.78\)
- B: \(4.79128 \ldots\)
- C: \(4.8\)
- D: \(4.79\)

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the quadratic formula or not fully understand the concept of a fixed point in a recurrence relation. They might approximate or make significant calculation errors. Option B seems too precise for them to calculate correctly, so they might opt for rounded versions like A, C, or D.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might not compute the quadratic formula accurately or consider significant figures. They might lean towards simpler, rounded answers like D.
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately solve the quadratic equation and consider the context. They would likely choose B for its precision or round it to D.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students would accurately calculate and consider rounding. They'd recognize B as the precise answer but might also see D as a correct rounding to 2 decimal places.

## 6: Assign percentages
Given the solutions and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (approximation), B=10% (too precise), C=20% (rounding), D=40% (simple rounding).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=15%, C=25%, D=40%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=40%, C=10%, D=45%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=60%, C=5%, D=35%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=40% C=10% D=45%
advanced: A=0% B=60% C=5% D=35%
