## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question requires rearranging the equation \( F = r \omega^{2} \) to make \( \omega \) the subject. This tests the student's ability to manipulate algebraic equations and may trap those with a common misconception of incorrectly handling the square on \( \omega \).

## 2: Identify the correct solution.
To make \( \omega \) the subject, we start with \( F = r \omega^{2} \). Dividing both sides by \( r \) gives \( \frac{F}{r} = \omega^{2} \). Taking the square root of both sides yields \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{F}{r}} \). This means the correct answer is B: \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{F}{r}} \).

## 3: Analyze potential misconceptions and errors.
A common error might be forgetting to take the square root of both sides after isolating \( \omega^{2} \), or misapplying operations. For example, some might mistakenly think \( \omega = \frac{\sqrt{F}}{r} \) (option D), which would be incorrect because it misinterprets how to handle the square root of a fraction.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with even basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly rearrange the equation or forget steps. Option A (\( \omega = r F^{2} \)) seems like a plausible mistake because it misinterprets the relationship between \( F \), \( r \), and \( \omega \). Option C (\( \omega = \sqrt{r F} \)) could also be a guess. However, given the simplicity of the options and the direct nature of the question, we expect a significant portion to guess or choose an obviously incorrect option.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each ability level.
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (simple, incorrect manipulation), B=20% (correct, but unlikely), C=30% (another incorrect form), D=20% (incorrect, but a plausible mistake).
- **Basic:** A=10% (less likely to make such a basic error), B=60% (more likely to get it right or understand the concept), C=20% (still a possible incorrect form), D=10% (less common incorrect form).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (unlikely), B=80% (most should get it right), C=10% (some might confuse), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (very unlikely), B=90% (almost certainly correct), C=5% (very unlikely), D=5% (very unlikely).

## 6: Finalize predictions.
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- **basic:** A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%

The best answer is B.
