To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 3+6 \div 2+1= \), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with the order of operations.

The correct calculation following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right) is:
\[ 3 + 6 \div 2 + 1 = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 \]

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception is to perform operations from left to right without adhering to the order of operations, or to forget the order of operations altogether. For this question, students might incorrectly calculate it as \( (3 + 6) \div 2 + 1 \) or \( 3 + 6 \div (2 + 1) \), or simply \( 3 + 6 + 1 \) ignoring the division.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 7 \) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \( 3 \) could be a result of \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \), then \( 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 \), but if one calculates \( 3 + 6 = 9 \), then \( 9 \div 2 + 1 = 4.5 + 1 = 5.5 \), which doesn't match. It seems unlikely but could result from a miscalculation like \( 6 \div 2 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 \) and then adding \( 3 \) to get \( 7 \), but actually, \( 3 \) doesn't directly follow from a simple miscalculation.
- Option C: \( 5.5 \) could result from \( 3 + 6 = 9 \), then \( 9 \div 2 + 1 = 4.5 + 1 = 5.5 \).
- Option D: \( 5 \) doesn't directly follow a simple order of operations mistake.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand the order of operations. They might calculate \( 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 \) and then \( 10 \div 2 = 5 \), or simply add and subtract from left to right: \( 3 + 6 = 9 \), \( 9 \div 2 = 4.5 \), \( 4.5 + 1 = 5.5 \). So, incorrect calculations are likely. 
  - A=20% (guessing), B=10%, C=30%, D=40%

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might struggle with the order of operations. They might calculate it as \( (3 + 6) \div (2 + 1) = 9 \div 3 = 3 \) or simply ignore division: \( 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 \). 
  - A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%

- **Proficient:** Students with a solid grasp of the order of operations should get it right or make minor calculation errors.
  - A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%

- **Advanced:** These students are highly unlikely to make mistakes.
  - A=95%, B=0%, C=3%, D=2%

## 4: Reformatting Predictions
Given the thought process and considering likely errors:
- below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
- basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
- advanced: A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%
