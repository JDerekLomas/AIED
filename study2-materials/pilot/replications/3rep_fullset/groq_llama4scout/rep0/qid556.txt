To approach this question, let's analyze the process Isaac used to transform the equation from \(9y = ?\) to \(y = ?\), and determine the operation that should replace the star.

## Step 1: Understand the Transformation
The transformation from \(9y = ?\) to \(y = ?\) involves changing the coefficient of \(y\) from 9 to 1. This implies that the operation performed on both sides of the equation must isolate \(y\).

## 2: Determine the Operation
To change \(9y\) into \(y\), we need to divide both sides by 9, because \(9y \div 9 = y\). This operation ensures that whatever is on the right-hand side of the equation remains balanced.

## 3: Analyze the Options
Given the operation needed is division by 9 to isolate \(y\), let's look at the options:
- A: \( +9 \) - Adding 9 to both sides would not achieve the transformation of \(9y\) to \(y\).
- B: \( \times 9 \) - Multiplying by 9 would increase the value, not decrease it to 1 times \(y\).
- C: \( \div 9 \) - Dividing by 9 is the correct operation to transform \(9y\) into \(y\).
- D: \( -9 \) - Subtracting 9 from both sides would not achieve the isolation of \(y\) in this context.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations. They might confuse operations or not understand the concept of balancing equations. Thus, they might choose any option randomly or based on a misconception. A=20%, B=20%, C=40%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra but might still make simple mistakes. They are more likely to recognize that division is involved to solve for \(y\), but could be distracted by other operations. A=15%, B=15%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts and should easily identify the correct operation as division by 9. A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the algebra but are also adept at applying it in various contexts. They would quickly identify the need to divide by 9. A=2%, B=2%, C=92%, D=4%.

The best answer is C. 

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
