## Step 1: Analyzing the Sequence
The sequence provided shows a pattern where the number of squares decreases by 2 from one term to the next: Pattern 1 has 7 squares, Pattern 2 has 5 squares, and Pattern 3 has 3 squares.

## 2: Identifying the Pattern's Rule
The rule appears to be a decrease of 2 squares for each successive pattern. So, to find the number of squares in the next term (Pattern 4), we subtract 2 from the number of squares in Pattern 3.

## 3: Calculating the Next Term
Applying the rule: Pattern 3 has 3 squares, so Pattern 4 would have \(3 - 2 = 1\) square.

## 4: Evaluating the Options
Given the calculation, the correct answer is that the next term in the sequence will have 1 square. Let's evaluate the options:
- A: \(2\)
- B: \(1\)
- C: \(0\)
- D: \(1.5\)

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with identifying patterns or performing simple arithmetic. They might not recognize the sequence or incorrectly calculate the next term. Given the simplicity of the arithmetic but the potential for not understanding sequences, they might be tempted by options that suggest a continuation of the pattern without a clear understanding of how it decreases. Option B (1) seems plausible for some as it's the closest to a logical next step if one understands the decrease but not for a straightforward calculation. However, without a strong grasp of patterns, \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 40\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a better grasp of basic arithmetic and some understanding of sequences. They are likely to recognize the pattern of decreasing by 2 squares but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 70\%\), \(C = 15\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Proficient:** These students should easily recognize the pattern and accurately calculate the next term. They are less likely to make mistakes on simple arithmetic. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 90\%\), \(C = 3\%\), \(D = 2\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong understanding of patterns and sequences. They are unlikely to make errors on this type of question. \(A = 2\%\), \(B = 95\%\), \(C = 2\%\), \(D = 1\%\).

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis, here are the predicted percentages for each ability level:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
