## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks us to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) when identifying the first mistake in a proof that \( (n+1)^{2}-(n-1)^{2} \) is divisible by 4.

## 2: Analyze the algebraic expression
The expression given is \( (n+1)^{2}-(n-1)^{2} \). Expanding this yields \( (n^{2}+2n+1)-(n^{2}-2n+1) \), which simplifies to \( n^{2}+2n+1-n^{2}+2n-1 = 4n \). This result is always divisible by 4 for any integer n, making the statement correct.

## 3: Examine the provided lines of work
- Line 1: \( n^{2}+2 n+1-\left(n^{2}-2 n+1\right) \)
- Line 2: \( n^{2}+2 n+1-n^{2}-2 n+1 \)
- Line 3: \( 2 \)

## 4: Identify the mistake
The expansion in Line 1 is correct, and the distribution in Line 2 is also correct, yielding \( 4n \) when simplified. However, the simplification to Line 3, which shows just "2", seems incorrect as it doesn't follow from the previous steps. The correct simplification from Line 2 is \( 4n \), not a constant.

## 5: Assess the difficulty and common misconceptions
The question tests the ability to identify errors in algebraic manipulation. A common misconception might involve incorrect distribution or combining like terms. However, given that the algebraic steps provided are straightforward and the mistake is quite obvious (the result should be \( 4n \), not a single number), even students at lower ability levels might spot the error.

## 6: Predict student responses
- **Below_basic**: Students might struggle with algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly identify the mistake or might choose randomly. Given the simplicity of the steps, they might incorrectly think everything is correct or not understand the mistake, leaning towards A or D.
- **Basic**: These students understand basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They should be able to see the mistake in Line 3 but might hesitate. They are likely to choose C (Line 3) as the mistake.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are comfortable with algebra and should easily identify that Line 3 is incorrect as it doesn't logically follow from the previous steps. They are likely to choose C.
- **Advanced**: These students have a strong grasp of algebra and should quickly identify the error. They are also likely to choose C.

## 7: Assign percentages
Given the nature of the question and the typical performance of students at each level:
- **Below_basic**: A=30% (not understanding the initial steps), B=20% (random choice), C=20% (correct identification but through luck), D=30% (thinking everything is correct).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=10%, C=70%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
