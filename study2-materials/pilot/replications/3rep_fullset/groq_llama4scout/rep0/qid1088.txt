## Step 1: Understand the question and the common misconception
The question is designed to test students' understanding of linear equations, specifically the equation $x + y = 8$. A common misconception might involve not understanding that for any linear equation of the form $x + y = c$, where $c$ is a constant, changing the value of one variable requires changing the other variable in a coordinated way to keep the equation balanced.

## 2: Analyze option A
Option A provides $x = 10$ and $y = 2$. When substituting these values into the equation $x + y = 8$, we get $10 + 2 = 12$, which does not equal 8. This option does not satisfy the equation.

## 3: Analyze option B
Option B provides $x = 10$ and $y = -2$. Substituting these values into the equation gives $10 + (-2) = 10 - 2 = 8$, which satisfies the equation.

## 4: Analyze option C
Option C provides $x = 8$ and $y = 1$. Substituting these values into the equation gives $8 + 1 = 9$, which does not equal 8. This option does not satisfy the equation.

## 5: Analyze option D
Option D provides $x = -8$ and $y = 1$. Substituting these values into the equation gives $-8 + 1 = -7$, which does not equal 8. This option does not satisfy the equation.

## 6: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand how to substitute values into an equation or may not recognize that they need to make $x + y = 8$ true. They are likely to choose options randomly or based on incorrect calculations. Given the straightforward nature of the correct option (B), but potentially confusing for those not understanding substitution: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying it correctly, especially if they haven't practiced substitution thoroughly. They might be tempted by options that look "easy" or might make simple arithmetic mistakes: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand the concept and can apply it. They should quickly identify that only option B fits: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concept but are also likely to solve the equation quickly or check each option efficiently. They should have a very high success rate choosing B: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%.

## 7: Adjust percentages based on question specifics
Given the question's clarity and the simplicity of checking each option against $x + y = 8$, even students who are below basic might have a chance to get it right if they can perform basic addition/subtraction, and proficient or advanced students will almost certainly get it right.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
