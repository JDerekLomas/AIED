## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a displacement-time graph for Mo's journey over the first 10 seconds. It states that during this time, Mo travelled at a speed of \(6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\). The task is to find the distance that should replace the star on the graph.

## 2: Identifying the Relevant Formula
The formula to relate speed, distance, and time is \( \text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} \). Rearranging for distance gives \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \).

## 3: Calculating the Distance
Given that the speed is \(6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\) and the time is \(10\) seconds, we can calculate the distance travelled as \( 6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \times 10 \mathrm{~s} = 60 \mathrm{~m} \).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing speed with distance or not using the given speed correctly. However, this question directly relates to the definition of speed, and the graph provided supports a straightforward calculation.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of speed and distance. They might not correctly apply the formula or misunderstand the graph. Option C (\(60 \mathrm{~m}\)) is the correct answer based on calculation, but these students might choose an option that seems to match a simple mistake, such as B (\(6 \mathrm{~m}\)), which could result from misinterpreting the speed as distance or not multiplying correctly.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to apply basic formulas. They might make simple calculation errors. Given the straightforward nature of the calculation, most should arrive at C (\(60 \mathrm{~m}\)), but some might incorrectly choose A (\(30 \mathrm{~m}\)) if they halve the speed or make another simple error.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily calculate the correct distance using the speed formula. They are less likely to make errors, so most should choose C (\(60 \mathrm{~m}\)).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will not only calculate the distance correctly but also understand the context and implications of the graph. They should almost universally choose C (\(60 \mathrm{~m}\)).

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Given the calculation \(6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \times 10 \mathrm{~s} = 60 \mathrm{~m}\), and assuming most students, especially those proficient or advanced, will get it right:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might get it by chance), B=30% (simple mistake), C=40% (correct), D=10% (other mistake).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=2%, C=92%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=2%, B=1%, C=96%, D=1%.

The best answer is C. 

Below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=92% D=1%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%
