## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question tests the student's understanding of the laws of indices, specifically the rule for multiplying terms with the same base, which states that \(a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}\). A common misconception could be adding the exponents or misinterpreting the operation.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(2a^2\) suggests an incorrect addition of the coefficients or misunderstanding of the exponent rule.
- Option B: \(3a\) implies adding the exponents and then somehow reducing it to a linear term, which is incorrect.
- Option C: \(a^3\) is the correct application of the index rule (\(a^2 \times a = a^{2+1} = a^3\)).
- Option D: "Does not simplify" might be chosen by students who are unsure or incorrectly think the expression cannot be simplified further.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
### Below Basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and the laws of indices.
- A: \(2a^2\) could be a guess or misunderstanding, 20%
- B: \(3a\) seems like an incorrect manipulation, 15%
- C: \(a^3\) requires understanding of index laws, 30%
- D: "Does not simplify" might be chosen due to confusion, 35%

### Basic
Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors.
- A: \(2a^2\) might still appear as a result of confusion, 10%
- B: \(3a\) is less likely but still possible, 5%
- C: \(a^3\) should be more recognized as correct, 60%
- D: "Does not simplify" could still be a option for those unsure, 25%

### Proficient
Proficient students are expected to have a solid grasp of algebraic rules.
- A: \(2a^2\) is less likely, 5%
- B: \(3a\) should be rarely seen, 2%
- C: \(a^3\) is the expected correct answer, 85%
- D: "Does not simplify" might still be considered by a few, 8%

### Advanced
Advanced students should have a deep understanding and apply it accurately.
- A: \(2a^2\) is unlikely, 1%
- B: \(3a\) should not be seen, 0%
- C: \(a^3\) is confidently correct, 95%
- D: "Does not simplify" would be minimal, 4%

## 4: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the predictions are as follows:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=60% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=85% D=8%
advanced: A=1% B=0% C=95% D=4%
