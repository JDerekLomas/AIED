## Step 1: Understand the quadratic formula and its components
The quadratic formula to solve equations of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\). For the equation \(3h^2 - 10h + 4 = 0\), we have \(a = 3\), \(b = -10\), and \(c = 4\).

## 2: Identify the components of the quadratic formula in the given equation
Substituting \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the quadratic formula, we get \(h = \frac{-(-10) \pm \sqrt{(-10)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 4}}{2 \cdot 3}\). Simplifying inside the square root: \(h = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 - 48}}{6}\), which further simplifies to \(h = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{52}}{6}\).

## 3: Simplify the expression under the square root
\(\sqrt{52}\) can be simplified to \(\sqrt{4 \cdot 13} = 2\sqrt{13}\), but for the purpose of filling in the blanks in the formula \( \frac{?\pm \sqrt{?-\square}}{?} \), we focus on the numbers directly. The expression under the square root in the quadratic formula is \(b^2 - 4ac\), which we found to be \(100 - 48 = 52\).

## 4: Match the components to the given formula
Comparing \(h = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{52}}{6}\) to \( \frac{?\pm \sqrt{?-\square}}{?} \), we see that \(? = 10\), \(\sqrt{?} = \sqrt{100}\), and \(\square = 48\) because \(100 - 48 = 52\). The denominator \(? = 6\).

## 5: Determine the correct answer
The question asks for what should replace the square, which is \(48\). So, we are looking for the option that corresponds to \(48\).

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the quadratic formula itself or substituting values into it. They might not correctly identify \(b^2\) or \(4ac\), leading to a higher chance of incorrect answers. However, the question directly asks for the value to replace the square, which is a straightforward calculation once \(b^2 - 4ac\) is understood. Expect a significant portion to struggle, but not necessarily choosing the wrong option in a predictable pattern without calculation.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of the formula but might make calculation errors. They should be able to calculate \(b^2 = 100\) and \(4ac = 48\), thus identifying \(48\) as the correct answer. Mistakes might occur in calculations or identifying the correct part of the formula.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to accurately apply the quadratic formula and calculate \(b^2 - 4ac = 100 - 48 = 52\), and thus know \(48\) is the correct value to fill in. They are less likely to make errors in identifying \(48\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the formula but are also adept at applying it quickly and accurately. They would easily identify \(48\) as the correct answer.

## 7: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the straightforward nature of calculating \(48\) once the formula is understood, and assuming most students are familiar with the quadratic formula:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55% (struggling with the concept or miscalculating)
- **Basic**: A=10% B=20% C=5% D=65% (mostly getting it right but some confusion)
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80% (accurately applying the formula)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95% (very confident and accurate)

The best answer is A.
