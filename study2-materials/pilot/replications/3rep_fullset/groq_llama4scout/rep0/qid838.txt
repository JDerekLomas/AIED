## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the area of the shaded section of a composite shape made from rectangles. The dimensions of the shape are provided, and the shaded section is specifically defined.

## 2: Identifying Key Dimensions
The full width across the bottom is 16m, with the partial width on the left being 2m, which implies the partial width on the right is 16m - 2m = 14m. The top block's partial width on the left is 7m. The full height on the right is 9m, with a partial height on the left of 3m, implying the top rectangle's height is 3m and the bottom rectangle's height is 9m - 3m = 6m.

## 3: Determining the Shaded Area
The shaded section's width is 14m (since it spans from the right edge to where the top rectangle begins) and its height is 6m (the height of the bottom rectangle, as the top rectangle starts at the 3m mark). Therefore, the area of the shaded section is 14m * 6m = 84m^2, but considering the actual layout, we need to calculate it based on the correct identification of the shaded area. The shaded area is actually a rectangle with dimensions 9m x (16m-7m) = 9m x 7m = 63m^2 for the lower part on the right or simply put, a rectangle of 7m by 3m on the right side which equals to 21m^2.

## 4: Analyzing Possible Errors
Given the layout, a common error might be misidentifying the dimensions of the shaded area. However, the question seems straightforward with clear dimensions provided.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students might struggle with calculating areas or identifying the correct dimensions. They might confuse the units (though cm is only in option D, which seems like a distractor). A=10%, B=20%, C=60%, D=10%
- **Basic:** Students should be able to calculate the area with some guidance. They might still make errors in identifying the correct rectangle. A=20%, B=60%, C=15%, D=5%
- **Proficient:** Students should easily identify the shaded area and calculate it correctly. A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%
- **Advanced:** These students should not only calculate the area correctly but also quickly identify the shaded section. A=0%, B=95%, C=5%, D=0%

## 6: Adjusting Predictions
Given the correct calculation for the shaded area is 21m^2 (as the top part of the shaded area is 3m high and 7m wide), the predictions should reflect the likelihood of choosing the correct answer.

The best answer is B. 

Below_basic: A=5% B=30% C=50% D=15%
Basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
Proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
Advanced: A=0% B=95% C=5% D=0%
