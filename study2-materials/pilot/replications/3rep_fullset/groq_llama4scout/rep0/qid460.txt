To approach this question, let's analyze each option given and consider what would make them correct or incorrect based on common mathematical misconceptions and understanding of equations.

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( t^{2} - 27 = 0 \). Solving for \( t \), we get \( t^{2} = 27 \), which means \( t = \pm \sqrt{27} \). Since \( \sqrt{27} \) is a real number (\( 3\sqrt{3} \)), this equation has real solutions.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( t^{2} = -27 \). There are no real solutions for \( t \) because the square of any real number cannot be negative. Thus, \( t = \pm \sqrt{-27} \), which involves imaginary numbers.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( t^{3} = -27 \). Solving for \( t \), we get \( t = -3 \) because \( (-3)^{3} = -27 \). This equation has a real solution.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \( t - 27 = -27 \). Solving for \( t \), we get \( t = 0 \). This equation has a real solution.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of real and imaginary numbers or might not be able to solve these equations confidently. They might incorrectly choose options that look solvable or seem familiar. Given the simplicity of solving A, C, and D, but not understanding the implications of negative under a square root, they might struggle. Expect mistakes across the board but particularly with B and possibly confusing A or C with having no solutions.

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a better grasp of basic algebra but might still struggle with the concept of imaginary numbers. They are likely to correctly solve A, C, and D but might not immediately recognize B as having no real solutions without calculating.

- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand quadratic and linear equations well and are familiar with the concept that \( t^2 \) cannot yield a negative result in real numbers. They should quickly identify B as having no real solutions.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the above but are also likely to solve these equations quickly and recognize the nature of their solutions. They should have a strong understanding of why B has no real solutions.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some can solve simple quadratics), B=30% (mistaking it for having solutions or not understanding), C=15% (less familiar with cubic equations), D=15% (simple linear equation).
- **Basic**: A=80%, B=15%, C=5%, D=0% (most can solve these but might hesitate on B).
- **Proficient**: A=95%, B=5%, C=0%, D=0% (strong understanding of real solutions).
- **Advanced**: A=100%, B=0%, C=0%, D=0% (high confidence in their mathematical abilities).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=80% B=15% C=5% D=0%
proficient: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
