To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions associated with it. The question asks for the exact value of \( \tan (30) \). This involves recalling trigonometric values for common angles.

## Step 1: Recall of Trigonometric Values
Students should recall that \( \tan (30) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \). To rationalize the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by \( \sqrt{3} \), which gives \( \tan (30) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \). This is a standard trigonometric identity.

## 2: Common Misconceptions and Errors
A common misconception might involve confusing \( \tan (30) \) with \( \sin (30) \) or \( \cos (30) \). For \( \sin (30) = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \cos (30) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), but \( \tan (30) \) specifically requires the recall of \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \) or its rationalized form \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \).

## 3: Analysis by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle to recall basic trigonometric ratios or might not understand the concept of \( \tan (\theta) \) at all. They are likely to choose incorrect options randomly or based on partial recall. Given the options, A (\( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \)) seems like a plausible recall for some, but errors will be high across the board.

- **Basic:** At this level, students have some familiarity with trigonometric ratios but might make careless mistakes or confuse ratios. They are more likely to recognize \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \) as a correct form but might also be tempted by \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) or \( \frac{1}{2} \) due to confusion with sine or cosine values.

- **Proficient:** Students here are expected to confidently recall and apply trigonometric identities. They should accurately identify \( \tan (30) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \) and avoid confusion with other trigonometric ratios.

- **Advanced:** These students not only recall the values accurately but also understand the relationships and can derive \( \tan (30) \) from first principles or known trigonometric identities. They are less likely to make errors.

## 4: Predicted Percentages
Given the above analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (some recall of the formula), B=20% (might confuse with another angle), C=30% (confusion with cosine), D=10% (incorrect guess).
- **Basic:** A=60% (good recall), B=20% (might think of another angle or operation), C=15% (confusion with cosine), D=5% (random guess).
- **Proficient:** A=85% (strong recall), B=10% (occasional lapses), C=4% (rare confusion), D=1% (very rare mistake).
- **Advanced:** A=95% (excellent recall and understanding), B=4% (extremely rare mistake), C=1% (very rare confusion), D=0% (no mistakes expected).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
