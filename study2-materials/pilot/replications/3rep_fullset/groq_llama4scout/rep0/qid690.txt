To approach this question, let's analyze what makes a sequence linear and how students at different ability levels might respond.

A linear sequence, or arithmetic sequence, is one in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term. This fixed constant is called the common difference.

1. **Tom's sequence:** \(1, 2, 4, 7, 11, \ldots\)
   - The differences between successive terms are \(2 - 1 = 1\), \(4 - 2 = 2\), \(7 - 4 = 3\), \(11 - 7 = 4\).
   - Since the differences between successive terms are not constant, Tom's sequence is not linear.

2. **Katie's sequence:** \(1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2, \ldots\)
   - The differences between successive terms are \(1.4 - 1.2 = 0.2\), \(1.6 - 1.4 = 0.2\), \(1.8 - 1.6 = 0.2\), \(2 - 1.8 = 0.2\).
   - Since the differences between successive terms are constant (\(0.2\)), Katie's sequence is linear.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is **D) Neither is correct** because Tom's sequence is not linear but Katie's sequence is.

Now, let's predict the performance of students at different ability levels:

### below_basic
- Students at this level might struggle with understanding what makes a sequence linear. They might not identify the common difference correctly or might not understand the concept at all.
- **A) Only Tom:** \(20\%\) (some might mistakenly think Tom's sequence looks linear due to increasing differences)
- **B) Only Katie:** \(10\%\) (a few might see Katie's sequence as linear but not understand Tom's)
- **C) Both Tom and Katie:** \(10\%\) (some might mistakenly think both are linear)
- **D) Neither is correct:** \(60\%\) (most might realize neither sequence provided fits the common understanding of linear sequences or simply pick this due to confusion)

### basic
- Students at this level have a basic understanding of linear sequences but might make simple errors in calculations or identifying sequences.
- **A) Only Tom:** \(15\%\)
- **B) Only Katie:** \(20\%\)
- **C) Both Tom and Katie:** \(5\%\)
- **D) Neither is correct:** \(60\%\)

### proficient
- Students at this level understand linear sequences well and can usually identify them correctly based on the definition.
- **A) Only Tom:** \(5\%\)
- **B) Only Katie:** \(25\%\)
- **C) Both Tom and Katie:** \(5\%\)
- **D) Neither is correct:** \(65\%\)

### advanced
- Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also quickly analyze sequences and their properties.
- **A) Only Tom:** \(0\%\)
- **B) Only Katie:** \(5\%\)
- **C) Both Tom and Katie:** \(0\%\)
- **D) Neither is correct:** \(95\%\)

So, the predictions are:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=5% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=25% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
