To approach this question, let's analyze what makes a graph quadratic and how students at different ability levels might perceive the options provided.

A quadratic graph is characterized by a parabolic shape, which can open upwards or downwards. This shape is symmetrical about its vertex. 

- Option A describes a straight line, which is not quadratic but linear.
- Option B describes a curve that increases but does not suggest symmetry about a vertex; it seems more like an exponential or a part of a cubic graph.
- Option C describes two separate curves that do not resemble a simple parabola; one seems to decrease rapidly and then level off, and the other drops quickly towards the y-axis and then becomes almost vertical.
- Option D describes a symmetrical U shape, which starts high, drops, levels off briefly (at its vertex), and then increases back to the starting level, characteristic of a quadratic equation graph.

Given these descriptions:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with recognizing graph types. They might confuse a quadratic with any curve.
  - A=40% (straight line might be recognized as not quadratic)
  - B=30% (could be mistaken for quadratic due to the curve)
  - C=20% (complex; might confuse with quadratic due to the presence of curves)
  - D=10% (symmetrical U; might be too complex for them to identify)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and are more likely to recognize a straight line but might still struggle with quadratic specifics.
  - A=60% (likely to recognize straight line isn't quadratic)
  - B=25% (might still confuse with quadratic)
  - C=10% (less likely to choose due to complexity)
  - D=5% (might not confidently identify the quadratic shape)

- **Proficient:** These students should have a good grasp of what a quadratic graph looks like.
  - A=80% (recognize the straight line)
  - B=10% (less likely to confuse with quadratic)
  - C=5% (unlikely to choose due to not matching a simple quadratic)
  - D=5% (confidently identify the quadratic)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have a deep understanding and quickly identify quadratic graphs.
  - A=90% (easily recognize the straight line)
  - B=5% (unlikely to confuse with quadratic)
  - C=2% (clearly not a simple quadratic)
  - D=3% (very confident in identifying the quadratic shape)

Correcting the prediction to fit the required format with specific percentages adjusted based on realistic expectations of student understanding:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
