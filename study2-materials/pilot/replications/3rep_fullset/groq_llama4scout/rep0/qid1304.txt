## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to reflect a point $P$ at coordinates $(2, 4)$ in the line $y = 4$. This means we are looking at a reflection across a horizontal line.

## 2: Reflection Across a Horizontal Line
When reflecting a point across a horizontal line, the $x$-coordinate remains the same, but the $y$-coordinate changes. Specifically, if the line of reflection is $y = k$, and the point to be reflected is $(x, y)$, then the reflected point is $(x, 2k - y)$. In this case, $k = 4$, so the reflected point of $(2, 4)$ is $(2, 2*4 - 4) = (2, 4)$.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: $(2, 3)$
- Option B: $(2, 4)$
- Option C: $(2, 2)$
- Option D: $(2, -4)$

Given the calculation in Step 2, the correct answer is $(2, 4)$, which corresponds to Option B.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand reflections or might misapply the concept. They could incorrectly think the reflection changes both coordinates or doesn't change them at all. There's a high chance they might pick an option that suggests a misunderstanding of reflection, such as A, C, or D. Given the simplicity of the question, option B might still be chosen by some due to chance or a superficial understanding that nothing changes. So, below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of geometry and might be familiar with the concept of reflection. However, they might not apply it perfectly, especially if they've had limited practice with reflections across lines other than the axes. They are likely to choose B, but there's a chance some might opt for C if they mistakenly apply a " mirrored" effect without calculating. So, basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of geometric transformations, including reflections. They should easily identify that reflecting $(2, 4)$ across $y = 4$ results in $(2, 4)$. Thus, proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also apply it with ease and understand the underlying mathematics. They will certainly choose B. So, advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
