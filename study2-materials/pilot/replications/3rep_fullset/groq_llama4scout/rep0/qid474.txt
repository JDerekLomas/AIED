## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to factorize the quadratic expression \( x^{2}+6 x+5 \). To factorize this expression, students need to find two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to 6. These numbers are 1 and 5 because \( 1 \times 5 = 5 \) and \( 1 + 5 = 6 \). Therefore, the correct factorization is \( (x+1)(x+5) \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions and Errors
- Option A: \( (x+2)(x+3) \) suggests a misunderstanding where students might be looking for factors of 6 that add up to 5, which does not apply here.
- Option B: "Cannot be factorised" might be chosen by students who do not know how to factorize quadratic expressions or think that not all quadratics can be factorized easily.
- Option D: \( x(x+6)+5 \) represents a failure to recognize the factorable form of the quadratic expression, instead treating it as a simple algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level
### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and factorization techniques. They might not recognize the expression as factorable or might not know how to proceed.
- A: \( (x+2)(x+3) \) could be a guess, 20%
- B: "Cannot be factorised" might seem correct if they don't understand factorization, 30%
- C: \( (x+1)(x+5) \) is the correct answer but might be hard for them to derive, 20%
- D: \( x(x+6)+5 \) could be an incorrect attempt at factorization, 30%

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and might be able to attempt factorization but could still make errors.
- A: \( (x+2)(x+3) \) might still be a tempting incorrect answer, 15%
- B: "Cannot be factorised" less likely as they have basic skills, 10%
- C: \( (x+1)(x+5) \) should start to become recognizable, 60%
- D: \( x(x+6)+5 \) is less likely as they understand basic algebraic structures, 15%

### proficient
Proficient students are expected to have a good grasp of factorization techniques.
- A: \( (x+2)(x+3) \) is a clear misconception, 5%
- B: "Cannot be factorised" is unlikely, 5%
- C: \( (x+1)(x+5) \) is straightforward for them, 85%
- D: \( x(x+6)+5 \) would be seen as incorrect, 5%

### advanced
Advanced students should easily recognize the factorable form and quickly identify the correct factors.
- A: \( (x+2)(x+3) \) is an obvious error, 2%
- B: "Cannot be factorised" is incorrect, 2%
- C: \( (x+1)(x+5) \) is immediately recognizable, 94%
- D: \( x(x+6)+5 \) is not a viable factorization, 2%

## 4: Conclusion
Based on the steps above, here are the predicted percentages for each ability level:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
