To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The question presents a parallelogram with one angle given as \(65^{\circ}\) in the bottom left corner. The task is to find the size of angle \(p\) in the top left corner.

## Step 1: Understanding Properties of a Parallelogram
A key property of a parallelogram is that opposite angles are equal. This means the angle opposite to the \(65^{\circ}\) angle (in the top right corner) is also \(65^{\circ}\).

## 2: Sum of Angles in a Quadrilateral
The sum of interior angles in any quadrilateral is \(360^{\circ}\). Knowing this, and that adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary (add up to \(180^{\circ}\)), can help solve for \(p\).

## 3: Calculating Angle \(p\)
Given one angle is \(65^{\circ}\), its opposite angle is also \(65^{\circ}\). Let's denote angle \(p\) as \(x\). Since adjacent angles are supplementary:
\[65^{\circ} + x = 180^{\circ}\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} = 115^{\circ}\]

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to think that since one angle is \(65^{\circ}\), angle \(p\) could be the same (A) due to a misunderstanding of parallelogram properties, or thinking there's not enough information (D), which is not the case here.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with properties of shapes and angle sums. They might choose A (\(65^{\circ}\)) because they don't understand that adjacent angles are supplementary, or D (Not enough information) because they can't see how to use the given information effectively. B and C seem less likely without calculation but could be chosen if there's confusion about which angles are equal or how to use the \(360^{\circ}\) rule effectively.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a basic understanding of shape properties. They might still choose A due to confusion or D if they don't recall that adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. 
- **Proficient**: These students should easily calculate \(p = 115^{\circ}\), choosing C. A and D should be less common, with B being an unlikely choice if calculations are done correctly.
- **Advanced**: These students will almost certainly choose C (\(115^{\circ}\)) as they are familiar with the properties of a parallelogram and can apply them accurately.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (misunderstanding properties), B=10% (random or calculation error), C=20% (some calculation skill), D=30% (lack of understanding or confidence).
- **Basic**: A=30%, B=10%, C=50% (understanding but might make simple mistakes), D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
