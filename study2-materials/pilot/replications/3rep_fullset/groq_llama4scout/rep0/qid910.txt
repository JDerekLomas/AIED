## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to expand the expression \(3(p-1)\). This is a basic algebra question that tests the student's understanding of distributing a number across a subtraction within parentheses.

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception in algebra is not applying the distributive property correctly, especially when there is a subtraction within the parentheses. Students might forget to distribute the negative sign or incorrectly apply it.

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \(3p - 3\), which is the correct expansion of \(3(p-1)\). To achieve this, one must distribute the 3: \(3 \times p - 3 \times 1 = 3p - 3\).

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \(3p - 1\). This option suggests that the student may have incorrectly distributed the 3, only multiplying \(p\) by 3 but not subtracting 1, or they simply didn't apply the distributive property to the constant term.

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \(p - 3\). This option indicates a significant misunderstanding, as it suggests the student only considered the \(-1\) inside the parentheses and ignored the \(3\) outside, or completely misapplied the algebraic rules.

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \(3p - 2\). This option might result from a calculation error where the student thought \(3 \times 1 = 2\) instead of \(3 \times 1 = 3\).

## 7: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level are likely to struggle significantly with algebraic expressions. They might not understand the concept of distributing or might make simple arithmetic errors. Therefore, they are more likely to choose incorrect options. Given the simplicity of the question but the potential for confusion, we might expect: below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%.

- **Basic:** Students at a basic level have some understanding of algebra but may still make errors, especially if the question requires careful application of rules. They are more likely to get it right than those below basic but might still select B or D due to oversight or simple mistakes. So, we might expect: basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand algebraic manipulations well and are less likely to make errors in simple expansions. They should mostly choose A, with few opting for incorrect answers. Hence: proficient: A=90% B=8% C=1% D=1%.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are comfortable with algebra and should have no trouble with this question. They are likely to choose A with almost no errors. Thus: advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=8% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
