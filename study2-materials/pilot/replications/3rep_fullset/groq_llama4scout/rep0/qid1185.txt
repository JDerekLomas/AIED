To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question requires completing the square for the quadratic equation \(y = x^{2} + 8x + 2\) and expressing it in the form \((x + a)^{2} + b\).

## Step 1: Understand the Process of Completing the Square
To complete the square for \(y = x^{2} + 8x + 2\), we focus on the quadratic and linear terms: \(x^{2} + 8x\). We add and subtract \((\frac{8}{2})^{2} = 16\) inside the expression to make it a perfect square: \(y = (x^{2} + 8x + 16) - 16 + 2\), which simplifies to \(y = (x + 4)^{2} - 14\).

## 2: Identify the Correct Answer
From Step 1, the correct answer is \(y = (x + 4)^{2} - 14\), which corresponds to option A.

## 3: Analyze Potential Misconceptions and Difficulty Levels
- A common misconception could be incorrectly identifying \(a\) or \(b\) in \((x + a)^{2} + b\). For example, mistakenly using \(8\) instead of \(4\) for \(a\), or miscalculating \(b\).
- The question seems straightforward, but students might struggle with the completion of squares, especially if they are not familiar with the formula or make calculation errors.

## 4: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand how to complete the square or could make significant calculation errors. They might choose C because they incorrectly think \(a = 8\) (matching the coefficient of \(x\)) or choose B or D due to miscalculations.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a basic understanding but might still make errors in calculations or not fully understand the process. They might lean towards A but could also be tempted by B or D if they misunderstand the constant term.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to complete the square accurately. They should mostly choose A but might have a small chance of selecting D if they mistakenly think the constant term adjustment is incorrect.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should easily complete the square and are less likely to make errors. They should predominantly choose A.

## 5: Estimate Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (some understand the process but struggle with calculations), B=20% (misunderstand the completion), C=30% (incorrectly use \(a=8\)), D=20% (another miscalculation).
- **Basic**: A=60% (understand but may calculate wrong), B=15% (simple mistake), C=10% (use \(a=8\)), D=15% (miscalculate \(b\)).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (accurately complete), B=5% (minor calculation error), C=5% (less common mistake), D=10% (occasional slip).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (expert level, very accurate), B=2% (rare mistake), C=1% (very rare), D=2% (extremely rare).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
