To solve this, let's consider what each term means and how students at different ability levels might respond:

- **Variable**: A symbol that represents a value that can change.
- **Expression**: A group of numbers, symbols, and/or operators that represents a value.
- **Equation**: A statement that two mathematical expressions have the same value, often with an equals sign.
- **Term**: A single part of an expression, separated by operators.

The question asks to describe \(3g\) in \(6 - 3g\). Here, \(3g\) is clearly a part of an expression, specifically a term because it's a single part separated by an operator. The expression \(6 - 3g\) itself isn't an equation because it doesn't have an equals sign; it's an expression. \(3g\) can be considered a term and also contains a variable.

## Prediction by Ability Level

### below_basic
At this level, students may struggle with basic algebraic vocabulary and concepts. They might confuse terms with variables or not fully understand the distinction between expressions and equations.
- A=30% (some understand \(3g\) changes, hence a variable)
- B=20% (might see it as part of a bigger expression but not specifically a term)
- C=20% (could mistakenly think it's part of an equation due to lack of understanding)
- D=30% (recognize \(3g\) as a term)

### basic
Students here have a foundational understanding but might still mix up concepts, especially under time pressure or with tricky wording.
- A=20% (understand variable concept)
- B=30% (see it as an expression, which is \(6-3g\), but not specifically focus on \(3g\) as a term)
- C=15% (less likely to think it's an equation)
- D=35% (identify \(3g\) correctly as a term)

### proficient
These students have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts and are less likely to confuse terms.
- A=10% (mostly understand \(3g\) is a variable but also more)
- B=25% (might consider the whole \(6-3g\) as an expression)
- C=5% (unlikely to think \(3g\) makes the whole thing an equation)
- D=60% (clearly see \(3g\) as a term)

### advanced
At this level, students have a nuanced understanding and can apply concepts accurately.
- A=5% (know \(3g\) involves a variable)
- B=15% (understand expressions but focus on \(3g\) as a term)
- C=0% (recognize it's not an equation)
- D=80% (easily identify \(3g\) as a term)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=25% C=5% D=60%
advanced: A=5% B=15% C=0% D=80%
