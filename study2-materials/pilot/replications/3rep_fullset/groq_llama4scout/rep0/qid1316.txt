To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might encounter.

The question is: \(\frac{\left(5^{6}\right)^{4}}{5^{2}} \equiv 5^{n}\). To solve this, students need to apply the rules of indices, specifically \((\left(a^{m}\right)^{n} = a^{m \cdot n}\) and \(\frac{a^{m}}{a^{n}} = a^{m - n}\).

## Step 1: Apply the power of a power rule
Using the rule \((\left(a^{m}\right)^{n} = a^{m \cdot n}\), we find \(\left(5^{6}\right)^{4} = 5^{6 \cdot 4} = 5^{24}\).

## 2: Rewrite the expression with the result from Step 1
The expression becomes \(\frac{5^{24}}{5^{2}}\).

## 3: Apply the quotient of powers rule
Using the rule \(\frac{a^{m}}{a^{n}} = a^{m - n}\), we get \(5^{24 - 2} = 5^{22}\).

## 4: Identify \(n\)
From \(5^{22}\), it's clear that \(n = 22\).

## 5: Analyze potential misconceptions and difficulties
- A common misconception could be misapplying the rules of indices, such as adding or subtracting exponents incorrectly when dividing like bases, or not applying the exponent rules properly.
- The question seems straightforward but requires careful application of exponent rules.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with applying the rules of indices correctly or might not fully understand the concept of exponents. They might choose A, B, or C due to incorrect calculations or misunderstandings. Given the simplicity of the correct calculation, a significant portion might guess or incorrectly apply rules, leading to: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple mistakes. They are more likely to get it right but could be tempted by obviously incorrect options: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and are likely to apply them correctly. However, they might still be distracted by simpler or more obvious calculations: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less likely to make mistakes. They would quickly and accurately solve the problem: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
