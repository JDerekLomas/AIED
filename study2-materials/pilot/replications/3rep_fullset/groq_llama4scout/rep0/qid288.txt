## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests
The question tests the understanding of negative exponents in the context of powers of a number. Given \( F = 3^a \), when \( a = -5 \), students need to apply the rule \( a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n} \) to find \( F \). The correct calculation is \( F = 3^{-5} = \frac{1}{3^5} = \frac{1}{243} \). A common misconception might involve incorrectly applying the exponent rule or misunderstanding the effect of a negative exponent.

## 2: Analyze the options for common misconceptions
Option A: \( -243 \) suggests a misunderstanding of both the negative exponent and the application of the base value.
Option B: \( -\frac{1}{243} \) implies a mistake in handling the negative exponent, possibly confusing it with a negative result directly.
Option C: \( -15 \) seems to result from a completely different operation or misunderstanding.
Option D: \( \frac{1}{243} \) is the correct application of \( 3^{-5} \).

## 3: Consider student performance at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic exponent rules and are more likely to make errors. They might choose A, B, or C due to a lack of understanding of negative exponents.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still fall into traps. They are likely to understand the concept of negative exponents but might apply it incorrectly or choose an obviously incorrect answer.
- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make simple errors. They should predominantly choose D.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately in various contexts. They are expected to choose D without hesitation.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at different ability levels
Given the nature of the question and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (mistaking for a large negative number), B=20% (incorrectly applying negative exponent), C=30% (completely incorrect operation), D=10% (correct application).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=15%, C=10%, D=55% (showing an understanding but with some still making errors).
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85% (accurately applying the concept).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (no errors expected).

## 5: Convert predictions into the required format
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
