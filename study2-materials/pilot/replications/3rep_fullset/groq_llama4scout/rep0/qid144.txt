To approach this, let's consider the nature of the question and the common misconceptions or understanding related to triangle numbers, square numbers, cube numbers, and Fibonacci numbers.

The sequence of triangle numbers starts as 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... (where each number can be represented as dots arranged in a triangle). 

## Step 1: Understanding Triangle Numbers
The nth triangle number is given by the formula $T_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$. 

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- **Option A (a square number):** To determine if the sum of consecutive triangle numbers yields a square number, let's consider an example. The first few triangle numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10. If we add 1 + 3 = 4, which is a square number ($2^2$). However, not all sums of consecutive triangle numbers yield square numbers.
  
- **Option B (another triangle number):** Let's examine if the sum of two consecutive triangle numbers results in another triangle number. For $T_n + T_{n+1}$, using the formula, we get $\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} = \frac{n^2 + n + n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} = \frac{2n^2 + 4n + 2}{2} = n^2 + 2n + 1 = (n+1)^2$. This result shows that the sum of two consecutive triangle numbers is indeed a square number.

- **Option C (a cube number):** A cube number is the cube of an integer, e.g., $1^3 = 1$, $2^3 = 8$. The sum of consecutive triangle numbers does not obviously result in a cube number based on general properties.

- **Option D (a Fibonacci number):** Fibonacci numbers are a series where a number is the addition of the last two numbers, starting with 0 and 1. The sequence appears as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... The sum of triangle numbers does not directly relate to Fibonacci numbers.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may struggle with basic concepts. They might not understand what triangle numbers are or how they relate to other types of numbers. Thus, they might be more prone to guessing or selecting an option based on a superficial understanding. $A=30\%$, $B=20\%$, $C=20\%$, $D=30\%$.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but may not have explored the relationships deeply. They might recall that triangle numbers have a specific formula but not necessarily their sums. $A=40\%$, $B=30\%$, $C=15\%$, $D=15\%$.

- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of mathematical concepts, including sequences. They might recall or figure out that the sum of two consecutive triangle numbers results in a square number. $A=60\%$, $B=25\%$, $C=5\%$, $D=10\%$.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are likely to not only know the properties of triangle numbers but also be able to derive or recall that their sum yields a square number. They might be less likely to consider the other options as viable. $A=80\%$, $B=15\%$, $C=2\%$, $D=3\%$.

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=60% B=25% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
