To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing: the ability to identify the correct formula for the area of a face of a cuboid, specifically the base labeled \( Q \). The dimensions given are height = 7cm, width = 4cm, and depth = 2cm. The face labeled \( Q \) is the bottom face, which would have dimensions corresponding to the width and depth of the cuboid.

## Step 1: Understanding the Cuboid's Dimensions
The cuboid has dimensions: height = 7cm, width = 4cm, and depth = 2cm. The face \( Q \), described as the base, would logically have an area calculated by multiplying its two dimensions.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Dimensions for Face \( Q \)
Given that \( Q \) is the base, and assuming the standard orientation where the base is defined by the width and depth (as the height is usually considered the vertical dimension), the area of \( Q \) would be \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \times 2 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 3: Evaluating the Options
- Option A: \( 2 \mathrm{~cm} \times 4 \mathrm{~cm} \times 7 \mathrm{~cm} \) calculates the volume, not the area of a face.
- Option B: \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \times 7 \mathrm{~cm} \) would be the area of a different face.
- Option C: \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \times 2 \mathrm{~cm} \) matches our identification for the area of face \( Q \).
- Option D: \( 2 \mathrm{~cm} \times 7 \mathrm{~cm} \) calculates the area of another face.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand the question or the concept of area and dimensions. They might randomly select an option or choose one that seems to involve all dimensions (A) because they think it looks complicated and thus correct. A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding of area but might get confused with the dimensions. They are likely to choose C, but some might mistakenly choose B or D. A=20%, B=25%, C=40%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand area and can apply it to a cuboid. They should easily identify C as the correct answer. A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also quickly eliminate incorrect options. They would certainly choose C. A=0%, B=5%, C=95%, D=0%.

The best answer is C. 

Below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
Basic: A=20% B=25% C=40% D=15%
Proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
Advanced: A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
