## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks for the equation of the \( x \) axis. This is a fundamental concept in coordinate geometry.

## 2: Recall the definition of the \( x \) axis
The \( x \) axis is defined as the set of all points where \( y = 0 \). This is a basic and straightforward concept that students typically learn early in their study of coordinate geometry.

## 3: Evaluate the options
- Option A: \( x = 1 \) represents a vertical line 1 unit to the right of the \( y \) axis, not the \( x \) axis.
- Option B: \( x = 0 \) represents the \( y \) axis, not the \( x \) axis.
- Option C: \( x = y \) represents a line where \( x \) and \( y \) are equal, which is not the \( x \) axis.
- Option D: \( y = 0 \) represents the \( x \) axis, as it includes all points where \( y \) is 0, regardless of \( x \).

## 4: Consider student misconceptions and understanding
Students often confuse the equations of the \( x \) and \( y \) axes. The \( x \) axis is defined by \( y = 0 \), and the \( y \) axis by \( x = 0 \). A common misconception might be to think the equation of the \( x \) axis involves \( x \) directly (like \( x = 0 \) for the \( y \) axis), but generally, students are taught the equation of the \( x \) axis as \( y = 0 \) from early on.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic coordinate geometry concepts. They might confuse the \( x \) and \( y \) axes or not recall the specific equations. Therefore, they might choose A, B, or C due to confusion, but there's a good chance they could pick B (\( x = 0 \)) as it's a common error to associate \( x = 0 \) with the \( x \) axis due to confusion with \( y = 0 \) for the \( x \) axis.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp but might still be prone to simple errors. They should know \( y = 0 \) for the \( x \) axis but might get confused with \( x = 0 \) for the \( y \) axis.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a solid understanding and should easily identify \( y = 0 \) as the equation of the \( x \) axis.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and should not make errors on such a basic concept.

## 6: Estimate percentages
Given the simplicity of the question and the fundamental nature of the concept:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might think a specific \( x \) value defines the axis), B=40% (common confusion with \( y \) axis equation), C=10% (less likely but possible if confused about axis equations), D=30% (some recall or guess correctly).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=20%, C=5%, D=65% (most know \( y = 0 \) but some still confuse).
- **Proficient**: A=2%, B=5%, C=1%, D=92% (strong recall of \( y = 0 \)).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (no errors expected).

The answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=5% D=65%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=1% D=92%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
