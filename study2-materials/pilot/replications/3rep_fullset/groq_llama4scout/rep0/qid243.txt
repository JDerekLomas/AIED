## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires solving the inequality $3n + 2 \geq 4n - 5$. This involves rearranging the inequality to isolate $n$.

## 2: Solving the Inequality
To solve the inequality, we first subtract $3n$ from both sides to get $2 \geq n - 5$. Then, we add $5$ to both sides, resulting in $7 \geq n$.

## 3: Expressing the Solution in a Different Form
The solution $7 \geq n$ can also be expressed as $n \leq 7$. This matches option C when considering the direction of the inequality.

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception when solving inequalities is reversing the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number. However, in this case, the operations involved do not include multiplication or division by a negative number, reducing the likelihood of this specific error.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly rearrange the inequality or might confuse the direction of the inequality sign. Option A ($-3 \geq n$) could be a result of incorrect manipulation. Option D ($n \geq 7$) could result from mistakenly reversing the inequality. 
- **Basic**: Students at this level are expected to handle simple algebraic manipulations but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to understand the concept of solving inequalities but might not always execute it correctly.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to accurately solve the inequality. They should recognize that the correct solution is $n \leq 7$ or $7 \geq n$, which corresponds to option C.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are not only proficient but also able to apply their knowledge to more complex problems. They should easily solve the given inequality.

## 6: Estimating Response Percentages
Given the simplicity of the inequality and the common pitfalls, we can estimate the response percentages:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (incorrect but plausible mistake), B=20% (another incorrect manipulation), C=40% (getting it right by chance or basic understanding), D=10% ( incorrect reversal).
- **Basic**: A=15%, B=10%, C=60%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
