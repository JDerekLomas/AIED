## Step 1: Understand the question and the options provided
The question asks for a correct second step to express a given expression as a single fraction, involving division of two fractions. The expression given is \( \frac{x-1}{6} \div \frac{x^{2}-1}{9} \), and the first step provided is \( \frac{x-1}{6} \times \frac{9}{x^{2}-1} \). We need to evaluate the second step from the given options.

## 2: Factor the denominator of the second fraction in the division
The denominator of the second fraction can be factored as \( x^{2} - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1) \). So, the expression becomes \( \frac{x-1}{6} \times \frac{9}{(x+1)(x-1)} \).

## 3: Simplify the expression
We can simplify this by cancelling out the \( (x - 1) \) from the numerator and the denominator, yielding \( \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{9}{x+1} = \frac{9}{6(x+1)} = \frac{3}{2(x+1)} \). However, the focus is on the step provided and which of the options matches a correct manipulation.

## 4: Evaluate the options
- Option A: \( \frac{9 x-1}{6 x^{2}-1} \) does not directly follow from the given steps and seems to be a result of incorrect manipulation.
- Option B: \( \frac{-1}{6} \times \frac{9}{x-1} \) suggests a mistake in factoring or cancelling.
- Option C: \( \frac{x-1}{6} \times \frac{9}{(x-1)(x-1)} \) incorrectly suggests \( (x-1)(x-1) \) as the factorization of \( x^{2} - 1 \).
- Option D: \( \frac{x-1}{6} \times \frac{9}{(x+1)(x-1)} \) correctly represents the next step before simplification, as it properly factors \( x^{2} - 1 \) and keeps \( (x-1) \) for potential cancellation.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students might struggle with factoring and basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly simplify or not recognize the factorization of \( x^{2} - 1 \), potentially leading to A or B being chosen due to confusion or lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should understand basic algebraic manipulations and factoring. They are likely to recognize the correct factorization but might make errors in cancellation or not see the obvious correct step, potentially choosing C due to oversight of the correct factorization or D if they understand it correctly.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily recognize the correct factorization of \( x^{2} - 1 \) and understand how to proceed with the division of fractions. They are likely to choose D as it directly follows from the initial step provided.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only understand the algebraic manipulations but also be able to simplify expressions efficiently. They would likely choose D without hesitation, as it represents a straightforward and correct step.

## 6: Assign percentages based on predicted student responses
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (misinterpretation of operations), B=20% (error in factorization or concept), C=30% (confusion with factorization), D=20% (recognizes correct form but might not execute properly).
- **Basic:** A=10% (understanding of operations but error), B=5% (basic understanding issues), C=20% (overlooks correct factorization), D=65% (correct understanding and application).
- **Proficient:** A=0% (clear understanding), B=0% (understands basic concepts), C=5% (rare mistake), D=95% (efficient and correct application).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no errors), B=0% (no conceptual issues), C=0% (correct approach), D=100% (efficient and accurate).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=20% D=65%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
