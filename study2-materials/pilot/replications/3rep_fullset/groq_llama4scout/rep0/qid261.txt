To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 90 \) minutes is the same as _________ hours, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or ease of calculation.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires converting 90 minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equal to \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions or Errors
A common misconception might involve incorrect conversion or misunderstanding of the relationship between minutes and hours. However, this question seems straightforward as it directly tests the conversion factor between minutes and hours.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 9 \) hours. This would be a significant error, likely resulting from a misunderstanding or miscalculation.
- Option B: \( 1.9 \) hours. This could result from a calculation error, such as \( 90 \times \frac{1}{60} = 1.5 \) but mistakenly calculated or rounded incorrectly.
- Option C: \( 1.5 \) hours. This is the correct answer, resulting from \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \).
- Option D: \( 1.3 \) hours. This would also be an error, possibly from incorrect calculation or estimation.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions. They might choose A (thinking 90 minutes is 9 hours because they don't understand the 60-minute hour concept), B (incorrect calculation), or D (another incorrect calculation). The correct answer, C, might be less likely.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple calculation errors. They are more likely to choose C but could be tempted by B or D due to calculation mistakes.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily convert 90 minutes to 1.5 hours, making C the most likely choice. Errors to B or D might occur but are less common.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will almost certainly choose C, as the conversion is straightforward and they are less likely to make basic calculation errors.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (misunderstanding of time conversion), B=20% (possible miscalculation), C=30% (correct but through luck or simple understanding), D=20% (another error).
- **Basic:** A=10% (significant error), B=15% (calculation mistake), C=70% (correct understanding), D=5% (minor error).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (rare error), B=5% (occasional miscalculation), C=85% (strong understanding), D=5% (minor error).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no significant errors), B=0% (no calculation mistakes), C=95% (excellent understanding), D=5% (unlikely but possible minor error).

## 6: Formatting the Answer
Below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
Basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
