## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The question provides a table of values for the equation \( y = x^2 - x + 1 \) and asks to find the value of \( y \) when \( x = -1 \), denoted by \( \bigstar \).

## 2: Identify the equation and the value of x for the missing y
The equation given is \( y = x^2 - x + 1 \), and we need to find \( y \) when \( x = -1 \).

## 3: Substitute \( x = -1 \) into the equation
To find \( y \) when \( x = -1 \), substitute \( x \) into the equation: \( y = (-1)^2 - (-1) + 1 \).

## 4: Solve the equation for \( y \)
Solving the equation: \( y = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \).

## 5: Consider the difficulty level and potential misconceptions
This question tests the ability to substitute values into a quadratic equation. A common misconception could be incorrect substitution or calculation. However, the equation is straightforward, and the numbers are simple.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substitution and calculation. They might incorrectly substitute or calculate, potentially leading to errors like \( y = (-1)^2 - 1 + 1 = 1 \) (B) or other incorrect calculations.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to substitute and calculate correctly but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to get it right or make simple arithmetic errors.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily substitute \( x = -1 \) into the equation and get \( y = 3 \) correctly, with minimal chance of error.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will also easily solve it correctly and are unlikely to make mistakes.

## 7: Estimate percentages for each option at each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (might get it right by chance), B=30% (simple error), C=20% (another error), D=30% (incorrect calculation).
- **Basic**: A=70% (correct), B=15% (careless mistake), C=10% (another mistake), D=5% (unlikely error).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (correct), B=5% (rare mistake), C=3% (unlikely), D=2% (very unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (correct), B=3% (rare), C=1% (very unlikely), D=1% (extremely unlikely).

## 8: Convert estimates into the required format
Given the estimates:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
