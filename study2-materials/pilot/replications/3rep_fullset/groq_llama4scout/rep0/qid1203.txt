To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the task and the potential pitfalls for students at different levels.

The task involves reflecting a rectangle across a horizontal line. The marked corner of the rectangle is at the top left. When reflected across a horizontal line, the y-coordinate changes sign (or, in more intuitive terms, it flips over the line), while the x-coordinate remains the same.

## Step 1: Understanding the Reflection
The reflection of a point across a horizontal line involves changing its vertical position to the opposite side of the line but keeping the horizontal position the same. 

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors
A common misconception might involve confusing the type of reflection (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical) or misunderstanding how coordinates change under reflection. However, this question is relatively straightforward because it deals with a visual representation rather than coordinates.

## 3: Analyzing the Question
Given the rectangle's position and the marked corner at the top left, reflecting this corner across a horizontal line would place it below the line, not above it, and at the same horizontal level. 

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding reflections or might not engage with the question properly. They could choose any option randomly or based on a misunderstanding of the transformation. Given the simplicity of the visual, a significant portion might still guess correctly or choose an answer based on visual intuition, but errors are likely due to lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding of geometry. They might still make errors if they confuse the line of reflection or misunderstand the concept, but a significant portion should grasp the reflection concept.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid understanding of geometric transformations. They should easily identify that the reflection across a horizontal line moves the marked corner from the top to the bottom but keeps it in the same vertical column, leading them to choose C.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but can apply it with ease. They are less likely to make errors.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the visual nature of the question and the straightforward reflection:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20% (guessing or incorrect understanding)
- **Basic:** A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5% (most understand reflection but a few misconceptions)
- **Proficient:** A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5% (strong understanding with minimal errors)
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5% (very strong understanding with almost no errors)

The best answer is C. 

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
