To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question is: \( T = k^4 \) and we need to find \( T \) when \( k = -3 \).

## Step 1: Understand the Question
The equation given is \( T = k^4 \), which means \( T \) is equal to \( k \) raised to the power of 4. When \( k = -3 \), we substitute \( k \) to find \( T \): \( T = (-3)^4 \).

## 2: Solve the Equation
To solve \( T = (-3)^4 \), we calculate \( (-3)^4 = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \). Since multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result, and we have an even number of multiplications, the result will be positive. So, \( (-3) \times (-3) = 9 \), then \( 9 \times (-3) = -27 \), and finally \( -27 \times (-3) = 81 \). Therefore, \( T = 81 \) when \( k = -3 \).

## 3: Analyze Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be to calculate \( T \) as \( -3^4 \) (which would be \( -81 \)) or to mistakenly apply the power of 4 directly without considering the negative sign properly, leading to incorrect calculations like \( (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = -81 \) or simply not understanding that an even power of a negative number is positive.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic substitutions and exponent rules. They might not correctly apply the exponent to the negative number or might confuse the operation. So, they could be inclined to choose C (\( -81 \)) because they might incorrectly think \( (-3)^4 = -81 \) due to not understanding that raising to an even power results in a positive number. A (\( 81 \)) might also be chosen by those who somehow manage to get it right or guess. B (\( 12 \)) and D (\( -12 \)) seem less likely as they don't directly result from common errors with this specific calculation.

- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a better grasp of algebra and exponents. However, they might still make careless mistakes or not fully understand the implications of raising a negative number to a power. They are more likely to choose A (\( 81 \)) but could make errors leading to C (\( -81 \)).

- **Proficient:** These students should understand the rules of exponents and negative numbers well. They are likely to choose A (\( 81 \)) as they correctly calculate \( (-3)^4 = 81 \). Misconceptions leading to other choices should be minimal.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong foundation and are less likely to make errors in basic calculations like this. They should easily choose A (\( 81 \)).

## 5: Estimate Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (correct guess or understanding), B=10% (unlikely), C=40% (common error), D=10% (unlikely).
- **Basic:** A=70%, B=5%, C=20%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=90%, B=2%, C=6%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** A=95%, B=1%, C=3%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=2% C=6% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%
