## Step 1: Understand the question and the relationship between Karen's and Marty's marbles.
The question states that for every 5 marbles Karen has, Marty has three times as many. This means if Karen has 5 marbles, Marty has \(5 \times 3 = 15\) marbles.

## 2: Determine the ratio of Karen's marbles to Marty's marbles.
Given Karen has 5 marbles and Marty has 15 marbles, the ratio of Karen's marbles to Marty's marbles, with Karen's part first, is \(5:15\). This ratio can be simplified by dividing both parts by 5, resulting in \(1:3\).

## 3: Analyze the answer choices.
- A: \(1:3\)
- B: \(5:3\)
- C: \(5:15\) is not listed directly but \(5:8\) is, which does not match our calculation.
- D: None of these

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and the difficulty level.
A common misconception might be to directly use the multiplier (three times as many) without considering the base (5 marbles for Karen). However, the question explicitly provides a basis for comparison ("for every 5 marbles Karen has"), which should help students avoid confusion.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below_basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding ratios or applying the "three times as many" correctly. They might choose B (\(5:3\)) because they mistakenly think the ratio is directly given by the numbers in the question without applying the multiplier correctly, or they might not understand how to simplify ratios. A (\(1:3\)) seems unlikely because they might not simplify correctly. C (\(5:8\)) could be a guess without clear calculation. D (None of these) might be chosen if they realize their calculation doesn't match any option but aren't sure what the correct answer is. Predicted percentages: A=10%, B=40%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a better grasp of ratios and should be able to calculate that for every 5 marbles Karen has, Marty has 15, leading to a \(5:15\) or \(1:3\) ratio. They are less likely to choose B or C. Predicted percentages: A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily understand the relationship and calculate the ratio as \(1:3\), making A the correct choice. Predicted percentages: A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only understand the concept but also be able to apply it quickly and accurately, reinforcing A as the correct choice. Predicted percentages: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 6: Format the predictions according to the required format.
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
