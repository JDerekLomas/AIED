To approach this question, let's first analyze what it's testing. The question provides a sequence of numbers: 1, 2, 4, 8, and asks which number these are the only factors of. This sequence is recognizable as the powers of 2: \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^3 = 8\). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Sequence
The numbers given (1, 2, 4, 8) are all powers of 2, suggesting that the number we are looking for is likely a power of 2, as these are its factors.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: 1. The factors of 1 are just 1, so this could potentially fit but let's check the others.
- Option B: 8. The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8, which matches the given sequence.
- Option C: 16. The factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. This also matches the sequence given but includes an additional factor (16).
- Option D: 64. The factors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, which includes more factors beyond the sequence provided.

## 3: Identifying the Correct Answer
The sequence 1, 2, 4, 8 are the only factors of 8 because 8 is \(2^3\), and its factors are \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3\) or 1, 2, 4, 8. For 16 (\(2^4\)), the factors are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, meaning 1, 2, 4, 8 are not the only factors of 16. Similarly, for 64 (\(2^6\)), there are more factors.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding factors or might not recognize the pattern. They might incorrectly choose A (1) because it's a simple number, or they might not understand the concept well enough to eliminate other options. 
    - A: 40% (misunderstanding of factors)
    - B: 30% (recognize the correct answer)
    - C: 20% (considering but not fully understanding)
    - D: 10% (advanced guess)

- **Basic**: At this level, students understand basic concepts of factors but might make careless mistakes.
    - A: 10% (simple but incorrect)
    - B: 60% (correct identification)
    - C: 20% (confusion with larger powers of 2)
    - D: 10% (ruling out larger numbers)

- **Proficient**: Students here have a good grasp of factors and powers of numbers.
    - A: 5% (unlikely to choose the simplest incorrect option)
    - B: 80% (correct answer based on understanding)
    - C: 10% (might consider 16 but recognize it has more factors)
    - D: 5% (likely to rule out 64)

- **Advanced**: These students are highly confident in their understanding.
    - A: 0% (highly unlikely)
    - B: 90% (confident in their choice)
    - C: 5% (for thoroughness, but quickly dismissed)
    - D: 5% (quickly ruled out)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
