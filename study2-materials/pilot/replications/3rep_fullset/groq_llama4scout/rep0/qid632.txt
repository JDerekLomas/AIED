## Step 1: Understand the question and the tariff structure
The question describes a two-tiered pricing system for electricity usage. For the first 100 units, Lethna pays at a rate of £0.25 per unit. For any units beyond 100, she pays at a rate of £0.10 per unit.

## 2: Calculate the cost for 800 units of electricity
To find the total cost for 800 units of electricity, we calculate the cost for the first 100 units and then add the cost for the remaining 700 units.
- Cost for the first 100 units = 100 * £0.25 = £25
- Cost for the remaining 700 units = 700 * £0.10 = £70
- Total cost = £25 + £70 = £95

## 3: Analyze the options given
The options provided are:
A: £110
B: £95
C: £200
D: £140

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic calculations or understanding the tariff structure. They might incorrectly apply the rates or make calculation errors. Option B (£95) is the correct answer, but students might choose A, C, or D due to miscalculation.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic math but might not fully understand the implications of the tariff change. They are likely to calculate the cost correctly but could be tempted by incorrect options if they misinterpret the rates or make arithmetic mistakes.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the tariff structure and can apply it correctly. They should easily identify the correct answer, B (£95), with minimal errors.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the tariff structure but are also less likely to make calculation errors. They should almost universally choose the correct answer, B (£95).

## 5: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the correct calculation is £95:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (overestimation), B=40% (correct but might not calculate it), C=20% (large overestimation), D=20% (another incorrect option).
- **Basic:** A=10% (error), B=80% (correct calculation), C=5% (significant error), D=5% (error).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (minor error), B=90% (correct), C=2% (significant error), D=3% (error).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no error), B=98% (correct), C=1% (rare significant error), D=1% (rare error).

## 6: Convert estimates to the required format
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
