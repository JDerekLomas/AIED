To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and the potential misconceptions involved.

The question revolves around the concept of factors in algebra, specifically with \(12y\). A factor of an algebraic expression is a part of it that can be multiplied to give the original expression. 

- Tom says \(y\) is a factor of \(12y\), which is correct because \(12y = 12 \times y\), so \(y\) is indeed a factor.
- Katie says \(3\) is a factor of \(12y\), which is also correct because \(12y = 3 \times 4y\), meaning \(3\) is a factor.

The question seems straightforward, testing the understanding of factors in algebraic expressions. However, the potential misconception here could involve misunderstanding what constitutes a factor, especially when variables are involved.

## Step 1: Analyzing the Question for Potential Misconceptions
The question does not inherently seem to trigger common misconceptions about factors and algebraic expressions in a way that would confuse proficient or advanced students. However, students at lower levels might struggle with abstract concepts.

## 2: Considering Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully grasp algebraic concepts or might confuse factors with multiples. They might not see \(y\) and \(3\) as factors in the same way or might not understand the question fully.
- **Basic:** Basic level students should have a foundational understanding of factors but might still struggle with applying this to algebraic expressions. They might recognize \(y\) as a factor but could be uncertain about \(3\) being a factor without seeing the numerical coefficient \(12\) broken down.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students should easily recognize both \(y\) and \(3\) as factors of \(12y\) because they understand that a factor can be a number or a variable that divides into an expression without a remainder.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will not only correctly identify \(y\) and \(3\) as factors but also understand the implications of this in algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
Given the clarity of the question and the straightforward nature of the algebraic concepts involved:
- Most students, even at the basic level, should be able to see that both \(y\) and \(3\) are factors of \(12y\).
- The question does not have a subtle trap that would commonly lead to a specific incorrect answer across many students.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (might think only Tom is right due to confusion), B=10% (might think only Katie is right), C=40% (some might understand both), D=30% (might not understand either).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=2%, B=2%, C=95%, D=1%.
- **Advanced:** A=1%, B=1%, C=98%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=98% D=0%
