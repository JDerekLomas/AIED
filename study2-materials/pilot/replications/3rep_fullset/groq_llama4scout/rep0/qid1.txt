To approach this question, let's first analyze the algebraic expression given and the common misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The expression to simplify is \( \frac{m^{2}+2 m-3}{m-3} \). 

## Step 1: Factor the numerator
The numerator \(m^{2}+2m-3\) can be factored into \((m+3)(m-1)\) because we find two numbers that multiply to -3 and add up to 2, which are 3 and -1.

## Step 2: Rewrite the expression with the factored numerator
The expression becomes \( \frac{(m+3)(m-1)}{m-3} \).

## 3: Identify potential simplifications
There's no direct factor of \(m-3\) in the numerator, so the fraction does not simplify in a straightforward manner that would cancel out terms.

## 4: Consider common student errors or misconceptions
A common error would be to try to factor the numerator in a way that doesn't work or to incorrectly cancel terms. For instance, if a student mistakenly thinks the numerator factors into \((m+1)(m+2)\) or similar, they might incorrectly simplify. However, the correct factorization \((m+3)(m-1)\) does not share a factor with \(m-3\), suggesting that most students who can factor the numerator correctly will see that it doesn't simplify.

## 5: Analyze the answer choices
- A: \(m+1\)
- B: \(m+2\)
- C: \(m-1\)
- D: Does not simplify

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with factoring and simplifying. They might incorrectly simplify or not attempt to factor, leading to random or incorrect answers. Given the options, they might mistakenly choose A, B, or C if they've made a simple factoring error or are trying to force a simplification that isn't there.

- **Basic**: Students here might correctly factor the numerator into \((m+3)(m-1)\) but then still mistakenly try to cancel with \(m-3\), potentially choosing A, B, or C if they incorrectly factor or assume a factor of \(m-3\) exists.

- **Proficient**: These students are likely to correctly factor the numerator and see there's no \(m-3\) term to cancel, thus choosing D: Does not simplify.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level will not only correctly factor but also quickly recognize the expression cannot be simplified further due to the lack of a common factor, leading them to choose D.

## 7: Estimate percentages based on typical student performance
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (incorrect simplification), B=20% (another incorrect path), C=20% (yet another), D=30% (recognizing it doesn't simplify or random choice).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=15%, C=20%, D=45% (as they have a better grasp but might still make errors).
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85% (most will correctly identify it doesn't simplify).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (all will recognize it doesn't simplify).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=20% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
