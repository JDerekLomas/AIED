To approach this question, let's analyze what it's testing and the potential misconceptions.

The question presents a parallelogram PQRS with arrows on sides QR and PS. The arrows are a common notation to indicate that two sides are parallel. 

- **Understanding the notation**: The use of arrows to denote parallel sides is a standard convention in geometry. 
- **Misconceptions and common errors**: A common misconception might be confusing the meaning of the arrows (e.g., thinking they indicate equal length rather than parallel). However, the context here makes it clear that the arrows are indicating a relationship between the sides.

Given this, let's predict the performance based on ability levels:

### below_basic
At this level, students may struggle with basic geometric notation and vocabulary. They might confuse the terms or not fully understand the implications of the arrows.
- **A=40%** (might think the arrows imply equal length, a common but incorrect assumption)
- **B=20%** (could think they are opposite but not understand the significance of the arrows)
- **C=30%** (some might recall that arrows indicate parallel sides)
- **D=10%** (equilateral is clearly incorrect as it refers to a specific type of triangle, not applicable here)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of geometric shapes and notation but might still be prone to mistakes due to lack of practice or deeper understanding.
- **A=20%** (less likely to think it implies equal length now)
- **B=15%** (recognize sides are opposite but might not fully leverage the parallel information)
- **C=60%** (most should understand the arrows denote parallel sides)
- **D=5%** (less likely to consider equilateral as an option)

### proficient
At this level, students have a solid grasp of geometric concepts and notation.
- **A=5%** (understand the distinction between parallel and equal length)
- **B=5%** (know the sides are opposite but focus on the parallel aspect)
- **C=90%** (arrows clearly indicate the sides are parallel)
- **D=0%** (no chance of selecting equilateral)

### advanced
Students here have an in-depth understanding and can apply concepts accurately.
- **A=0%** (no confusion with equal length)
- **B=0%** (understand "opposite" is true but not the focus of the arrows)
- **C=100%** (accurately understand the implication of the arrows)
- **D=0%** (equilateral is not relevant)

So, here are the predictions in the required format:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
