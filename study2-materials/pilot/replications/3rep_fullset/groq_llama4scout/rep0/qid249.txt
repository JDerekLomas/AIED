## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question tests the understanding of solving simultaneous equations, specifically the method of elimination. It presents two equations: \(3x - 2y = 8\) and \(3x + y = 14\). The task is to determine who is correct between Tom and Katie, where Tom suggests adding the two equations to eliminate a variable, and Katie suggests subtracting them.

## 2: Analyze Tom's suggestion.
If Tom adds the two equations: \((3x - 2y) + (3x + y) = 8 + 14\), this simplifies to \(6x - y = 22\). Here, Tom is incorrect because adding the equations does not eliminate a variable; it results in \(6x - y = 22\), which still has both \(x\) and \(y\).

## 3: Analyze Katie's suggestion.
If Katie subtracts the two equations: \((3x - 2y) - (3x + y) = 8 - 14\), this simplifies to \(-3y = -6\), which further simplifies to \(y = 2\). Katie is correct because subtracting the equations eliminates \(x\), allowing for the solution of \(y\).

## 4: Determine the correct answer.
Given the analysis, Katie is correct because subtracting the equations eliminates a variable (\(x\)), while Tom is incorrect because adding the equations does not eliminate a variable. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Only Katie.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may not fully understand the concept of elimination in simultaneous equations. They might not realize that adding the equations doesn't eliminate a variable but could mistakenly think Tom is right or not understand Katie's method. \(A = 30\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 40\%\).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might struggle with the application. They might see that adding doesn't work but could be unsure or think both are wrong due to misunderstanding the elimination method. \(A = 15\%\), \(B = 40\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 35\%\).
- **Proficient:** These students understand the elimination method and can apply it. They should recognize Katie's approach as correct and Tom's as incorrect. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 60\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 30\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the method but can also analyze it critically. They will easily see that Katie is correct and Tom is not. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 80\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 15\%\).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=0% B=80% C=5% D=15%
