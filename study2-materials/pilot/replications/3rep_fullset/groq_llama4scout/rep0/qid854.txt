To approach this question, let's first understand what a cube number is. A cube number is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times. For example, the first few cube numbers are \(1^3 = 1\), \(2^3 = 8\), \(3^3 = 27\), \(4^3 = 64\), \(5^3 = 125\).

The question asks for the first cube number greater than 100. 

## Step 1: Identify the relevant cube numbers around 100.
We know \(4^3 = 64\) and \(5^3 = 125\). So, the first cube number greater than 100 is \(5^3 = 125\).

## 2: Evaluate the answer choices based on the calculation.
- A: \(103\) is not a perfect cube.
- B: \(125\) is \(5^3\), a perfect cube and greater than 100.
- C: \(121\) is not a perfect cube (\(11^2 = 121\), but it's not a cube).
- D: \(102\) is not a perfect cube.

## 3: Consider common misconceptions or errors.
A common error might be confusing cube numbers with square numbers or simply not knowing the sequence of cube numbers well. For instance, some might mistakenly think \(4^3 = 64\) is the closest and then incorrectly calculate or recall the next cube.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand what cube numbers are or how to calculate them. They might guess or choose an option that seems "close" to 100 or looks like it could be a cube. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 30\%\).
- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might struggle with recalling specific cube numbers. They might recognize \(125\) as a cube but could be unsure. \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 60\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to know their cube numbers and can calculate or recall that \(5^3 = 125\). \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 80\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are confident in their knowledge of cube numbers and mathematical operations. They would easily identify \(125\) as the correct answer. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 95\%\), \(C = 0\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

The best answer is B. 

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
