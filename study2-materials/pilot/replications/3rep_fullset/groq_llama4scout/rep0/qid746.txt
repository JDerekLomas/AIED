To approach this question, let's break down the mathematical operations and the common misconceptions associated with them, particularly focusing on the order of operations.

The question given is: \( 4+12 \div(2+2)= \)

First, we solve the operation within the parentheses: \( 2+2 = 4 \).

Then, the equation becomes: \( 4+12 \div 4 = \)

Next, we perform the division: \( 12 \div 4 = 3 \).

So, the equation simplifies to: \( 4 + 3 = 7 \).

The correct answer is B) \( 7 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
The order of operations is a fundamental concept in mathematics, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). This question requires the application of BIDMAS to solve it correctly.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception among students is to perform operations from left to right without adhering to the order of operations. For this question, a likely error would be to calculate \( 4 + 12 = 16 \) and then \( 16 \div 4 = 4 \), which corresponds to option D) \( 4 \). Another error could be ignoring the brackets and calculating \( 12 \div 2 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \) and then \( 4 + 8 = 12 \), which is not an option but indicates a misunderstanding. However, the closest and most relevant misconception leading to an provided option would indeed relate to misinterpreting the order of operations.

## 3: Assessing Student Performance by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand or consistently apply the order of operations. They are more likely to make calculation errors or ignore the brackets, leading to incorrect answers. Option D) \( 4 \) seems plausible as it could result from a straightforward left-to-right calculation error (\( 4 + 12 = 16 \), \( 16 \div 4 = 4 \)). A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic operations but might still struggle with the order of operations or making calculation mistakes. They are more likely to get the correct answer but could be tempted by straightforward addition and division. A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the order of operations and can apply it. They are less likely to make errors in this type of question. A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the order of operations but are also adept at more complex mathematical concepts. They would easily solve this question correctly. A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
