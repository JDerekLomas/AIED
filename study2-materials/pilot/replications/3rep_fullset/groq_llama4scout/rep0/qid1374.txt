## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests
The question tests the ability to complete the square for a quadratic expression and compare it with a given form. The equation given is \(x^{2} - 5x + 8 \equiv (x - b)^{2} + 1.75\). To find \(b\), we need to complete the square on the left side and compare.

## 2: Complete the square for the given quadratic expression
The quadratic expression is \(x^{2} - 5x + 8\). To complete the square, we take the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(-5\), divide it by 2 (getting \(-\frac{5}{2}\)), and then square it (getting \(\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\)). So, \(x^{2} - 5x + 8\) can be rewritten as \((x - \frac{5}{2})^{2} - 6.25 + 8\), which simplifies to \((x - \frac{5}{2})^{2} + 1.75\).

## 3: Compare with the given form to find \(b\)
Comparing \((x - \frac{5}{2})^{2} + 1.75\) with \((x - b)^{2} + 1.75\), it's clear that \(b = \frac{5}{2}\).

## 4: Analyze the difficulty and potential misconceptions
This question requires algebraic manipulation and understanding of completing the square. A common misconception might involve incorrectly completing the square or misinterpreting the equation. However, the numbers given are straightforward, and the structure of the question is clear, which might reduce the likelihood of errors related to completing the square.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with completing the square and algebraic manipulations. They might not even attempt to solve it or could choose an answer based on incorrect simplifications. Given the clarity of the question, \(D = \frac{5}{2}\) seems like a correct answer that requires some understanding. A=20% B=15% C=20% D=45%
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to attempt completing the square but could get confused. The correct answer \(D = \frac{5}{2}\) is derived directly from completing the square, so A=10% B=10% C=15% D=65%
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations, including completing the square. They are likely to get the correct answer without much trouble. A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and can quickly complete the square. They are very likely to choose the correct answer. A=2% B=2% C=5% D=91%

The best answer is D.
