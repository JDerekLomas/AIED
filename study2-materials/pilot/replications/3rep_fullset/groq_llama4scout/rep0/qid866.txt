To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing: the understanding of negative numbers and the concept of distance or difference between two points on a number line. The question requires students to calculate how many floors Asha needs to go down from her office on level 7 to her car parked on level -2.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question involves moving from a positive level (7) to a negative level (-2) on a number line, which can sometimes cause confusion for students who are not comfortable with negative numbers.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve simply subtracting the levels without considering the direction or incorrectly handling the negative numbers. For example, some students might think to subtract -2 from 7 (which gives 9) but then not understand that going from 7 to -2 means going down.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: 10
- Option B: 5
- Option C: 9
- Option D: 7

The correct calculation to get from level 7 to level -2 is to find the difference: \(7 - (-2) = 7 + 2 = 9\). So, the correct answer is C: 9.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with negative numbers and understanding the concept of moving down from a positive to a negative level. They might choose D: 7 (as a straightforward subtraction without considering the negative), A: 10 (possibly adding 2 to 7 and then 1 more for a mistaken reason), B: 5 (a random or incorrect calculation), or C: 9 (if they somehow manage to get it right). Given the simplicity of the numbers, let's assume a high chance of error: A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a better grasp of basic number operations but might still struggle with the concept of negative levels. They are likely to understand that moving from 7 to -2 requires going down more floors than just 7. Let's predict: A=20%, B=15%, C=60%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** Students here should easily understand the concept and calculate the difference correctly. Expect a high percentage to choose C: 9. Prediction: A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** For advanced students, this question should be straightforward. They will likely all choose C: 9. Prediction: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- **basic:** A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The best answer is C.
