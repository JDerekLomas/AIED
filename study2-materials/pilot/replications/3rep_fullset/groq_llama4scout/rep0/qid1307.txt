To solve this, let's consider how students at different levels might approach the problem and the common misconceptions or difficulties they might encounter.

## Step 1: Understand the Task
The task involves expanding the given expression \((x+2)(x-4)(x-7)\) by first splitting it into \(x(x-4)(x-7) + 2(x-4)(x-7)\) and then finding the terms that contain \(x^2\) before simplification.

## 2: Identify Key Concepts
The key concept here is the expansion of brackets and the identification of terms with \(x^2\). Students need to apply the distributive property (FOIL method for two brackets, extended for three brackets) and then identify terms.

## 3: Analyze Possible Misconceptions
A common misconception could be in the application of the distributive property or in identifying and combining like terms. However, the question specifically asks for terms containing \(x^2\) before simplification, which might reduce errors related to combining like terms.

## 4: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the basic algebraic manipulations and could easily make mistakes in expanding the brackets or identifying \(x^2\) terms.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might still make errors in quickly identifying \(x^2\) terms, especially if they rush through the calculations.
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to accurately expand the expressions and identify \(x^2\) terms without much difficulty.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to not only accurately perform the task but also to do so efficiently and possibly to simplify or analyze the expressions further.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
Given the expression \(x(x-4)(x-7) + 2(x-4)(x-7)\), let's focus on the \(x^2\) terms:
- Expanding \(x(x-4)(x-7)\) gives \(x(x^2 - 11x + 28) = x^3 - 11x^2 + 28x\), which contains an \(-11x^2\) term.
- Expanding \(2(x-4)(x-7)\) gives \(2(x^2 - 11x + 28) = 2x^2 - 22x + 56\), which contains a \(+2x^2\) term.

## 6: Identifying \(x^2\) Terms
The \(x^2\) terms from the expansions are \(-11x^2\) and \(+2x^2\). 

## 7: Matching to Options
- The correct \(x^2\) terms are \(-11x^2\) and \(+2x^2\). 
- To match the format of the given options, we notice:
  - There's no direct \(-11x^2\) but we see \(-7x^2\), \(-4x^2\), and \(+2x^2\) in the options.

## 8: Estimating Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Might not accurately expand or identify terms. Could see A, B, C, or D with significant error rates.
- **Basic:** Likely to make some errors but understands basic expansions. Might lean towards simpler, more straightforward options.
- **Proficient:** Should accurately identify \(x^2\) terms. Option D seems plausible as it includes \(-4x^2\), \(-7x^2\), and \(+2x^2\), but let's analyze:
  - The term \(-11x^2\) can come from \(-7x^2 - 4x^2\), suggesting D could be correct if considering combinations.

## 9: Conclusion
Given the likely expansions and common errors:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The best answer is D. 

Therefore, based on analysis:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
