To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question involves reflecting a point \( Q(4, -4) \) in the line \( y = -x \). The reflection of a point \( (x, y) \) in the line \( y = -x \) is given by \( (-y, -x) \). Therefore, for point \( Q(4, -4) \), the new coordinates after reflection would be \( (-(-4), -4) = (4, -4) \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Reflection Process
The line \( y = -x \) acts as a mirror. When reflecting over this line, the x and y coordinates swap places and change signs. So, for \( Q(4, -4) \), applying the rule: new x coordinate is \( -(-4) = 4 \) and new y coordinate is \( -4 \), resulting in \( (4, -4) \).

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not correctly swapping and changing the signs of the coordinates. Another might be confusing the line of reflection or misapplying the transformation.

## 3: Evaluating Each Option
- A: \( (4, 4) \) suggests a mistake where both coordinates change sign but do not swap.
- B: \( (-4, -4) \) suggests a mistake where coordinates change sign but do not swap correctly.
- C: \( (-4, 4) \) suggests the correct application of the transformation: \( (-y, -x) \) for \( (4, -4) \) results in \( (4, -4) \), not \( (-4, 4) \), indicating a potential misunderstanding.
- D: \( (4, -4) \) is the correct answer, as explained.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with coordinate geometry basics. They might not understand the concept of reflection in a line or might confuse the transformation. Expect a high chance of errors.
  - A: 20% (incorrect transformation)
  - B: 25% (change in sign but no swap)
  - C: 30% (swapping but incorrect signs or misunderstanding)
  - D: 25% (correct, but potentially by chance)

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make simple errors.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 15%
  - C: 20%
  - D: 55%

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make careless mistakes.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 10%
  - D: 80%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident and accurate.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 0%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 95%

The best answer is D. 

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=20% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
