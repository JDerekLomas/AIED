To approach this question, let's first understand what the Function Machine does and then evaluate the expressions given by Tom and Katie.

The Function Machine takes an input \(n\), subtracts 4, and then multiplies the result by 3. So, the correct output can be represented as \(3(n - 4)\).

## Step 1: Evaluate Tom's expression
Tom says the output is \(3n - 12\). Let's see if this is equivalent to the correct operation: 
\[3(n - 4) = 3n - 12\]
So, Tom's expression \(3n - 12\) is actually equivalent to the correct operation.

## 2: Evaluate Katie's expression
Katie says the output is \(3(n - 4)\). This directly matches the description of the Function Machine's operation.

## 3: Compare Tom and Katie's expressions
Both Tom (\(3n - 12\)) and Katie (\(3(n - 4)\)) are mathematically equivalent. The question is who is correct given the function machine's operations.

## 4: Analyze the potential for student errors
- Students at the below_basic level might struggle to understand the equivalence of the expressions and could mistakenly think one or both are incorrect due to not fully understanding the algebra or the function machine's operation.
- Basic level students might start to see the equivalence but could still make errors in algebraic manipulation or in interpreting the function machine's steps.
- Proficient students should easily see that both expressions are equivalent and correctly represent the function machine's output.
- Advanced students will not only confirm the equivalence but also understand why the expressions are interchangeable.

## 5: Predict student responses
Given the algebraic equivalence of \(3n - 12\) and \(3(n - 4)\), and that both accurately describe the function machine's operation:
- **Below Basic**: Might not fully understand the algebra, so could think either or both are incorrect. A=20%, B=20%, C=30%, D=30%
- **Basic**: Starting to understand algebra, might make some errors. A=15%, B=15%, C=60%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: Should understand the algebra and see the equivalence. A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%
- **Advanced**: Will definitely understand the equivalence. A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%

The best answer is below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=98% D=2%.
