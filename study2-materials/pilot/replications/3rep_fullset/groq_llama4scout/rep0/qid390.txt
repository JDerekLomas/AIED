To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "What is \( 5.5 \% \) of \( 400 \) ?", let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might encounter.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to calculate \( 5.5 \% \) of \( 400 \). This involves converting the percentage to a decimal and then multiplying by \( 400 \).

## 2: Calculation
To find \( 5.5 \% \) of \( 400 \), first convert \( 5.5 \% \) to a decimal: \( 5.5 \% = 0.055 \). Then, multiply by \( 400 \): \( 0.055 \times 400 = 22 \).

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect conversion of percentages to decimals or misunderstanding the operation (e.g., adding or subtracting instead of multiplying). For \( 5.5 \% \) of \( 400 \), another potential error could be treating \( 5.5 \% \) as \( 5.5 \) (ignoring the percentage sign) or miscalculating the decimal equivalent.

## 4: Analyzing Options
- Option A: \( 22 \) (correct answer)
- Option B: \( 11 \) (might be chosen by those who incorrectly calculate \( 5.5 \% \) as \( 0.0275 \) or similar, but more likely by students who see \( 5.5 \) and think of \( 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \))
- Option C: \( 5.5 \) (could be chosen by students who forget to multiply by \( 400 \) or misinterpret the question)
- Option D: \( 220 \) (might be chosen by students who incorrectly calculate, possibly thinking \( 5.5 \times 40 = 220 \) or similar)

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with percentage calculations and decimal conversions. They might choose C (\( 5.5 \)) because they don't understand the operation or B (\( 11 \)) due to a miscalculation. D (\( 220 \)) could also be an option if they mistakenly multiply \( 5.5 \) by \( 40 \). A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%
- **Basic:** Basic level students should have a grasp of percentages and decimals but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to get it right or make simple calculation errors. A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand percentages and decimals well and are less likely to make errors in calculation. A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are highly unlikely to make mistakes in such a straightforward calculation. A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%

The best answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
