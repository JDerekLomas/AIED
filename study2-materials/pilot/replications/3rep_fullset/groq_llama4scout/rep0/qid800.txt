## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents two angles around a point labeled as \(2y\) and \(y\). The task is to find the size of angle \(y\). A key mathematical concept here is that the sum of angles around a point is \(360^\circ\).

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception might be to think that angles on a straight line add up to \(180^\circ\) (which they do) but forgetting that around a point, they add up to \(360^\circ\). However, the specific labels \(2y\) and \(y\) suggest a simple algebraic relationship rather than a straightforward application of angle sums.

## 3: Solving the Question
To solve for \(y\), we use the fact that angles around a point add up to \(360^\circ\). So, \(2y + y = 360^\circ\), which simplifies to \(3y = 360^\circ\). Solving for \(y\) gives \(y = 120^\circ\).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand that angles around a point add up to \(360^\circ\) or might struggle with simple algebra. They might choose \(A = 180^\circ\) thinking of a straight line, \(C = 90^\circ\) as a common angle, or \(D\) if they're unsure.
- **Basic:** These students should be familiar with angles around a point and basic algebra. However, they might still make errors if they misapply formulas or make algebraic mistakes.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level are likely to solve the problem correctly but might spend a moment ensuring they're applying the right concept.
- **Advanced:** These students will quickly and accurately solve the problem.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (thinking of a straight line), B=20% (correct but let's see if they actually get it), C=20% (common angle, potentially thinking of a right angle), D=20% (lack of understanding or information).
- **Basic:** A=10% (less likely to confuse with a straight line), B=70% (should get it right with basic algebra), C=5% (some residual confusion), D=15% (still some uncertainty).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (unlikely to confuse), B=85% (should easily solve it), C=0% (unlikely to choose \(90^\circ\)), D=10% (just in case they second-guess).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no chance of confusing with \(180^\circ\)), B=95% (quick and accurate), C=0% (no chance), D=5% (perhaps just for the sake of argument or ensuring no other mistake).
