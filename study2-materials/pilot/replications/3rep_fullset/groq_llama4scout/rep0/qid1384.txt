To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the expression \( x^{2} - 9 \) and common misconceptions related to factorization, particularly the difference of squares.

The expression \( x^{2} - 9 \) is a difference of squares, which can be factorized into \( (x - 3)(x + 3) \). This is a well-known algebraic identity: \( a^{2} - b^{2} = (a - b)(a + b) \). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not recognizing the difference of squares or incorrectly applying factorization rules. For instance, students might mistakenly try to factor it as a perfect square trinomial or simply subtract 9 from \( x^{2} \) without applying the correct formula.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( (x - 3)(x + 3) \) is the correct factorization.
- Option B: \( x(x - 9) \) is incorrect because it does not apply the difference of squares formula.
- Option C: \( (x - 3)^{2} \) is incorrect because it suggests \( x^{2} - 9 \) is a perfect square trinomial, which it is not.
- Option D: \( \text{Cannot be factorised} \) is incorrect because \( x^{2} - 9 \) can indeed be factorized.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not recognize the difference of squares or could choose an option that seems to simplify the expression without applying correct rules. Expect a higher percentage to choose incorrect options, especially B, C, or D, due to lack of understanding. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 40\% \), \( C = 30\% \), \( D = 10\% \).
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of algebra but might still struggle with recognizing the difference of squares. They might choose B or C due to misunderstanding or not seeing the correct factorization. \( A = 60\% \), \( B = 25\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to recognize the difference of squares and correctly factorize \( x^{2} - 9 \). They might still make mistakes if they misapply rules, but the correct answer should be more commonly chosen. \( A = 85\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 3\% \), \( D = 2\% \).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to have a strong grasp of algebraic identities, including the difference of squares. They should easily recognize the correct factorization. \( A = 95\% \), \( B = 3\% \), \( C = 1\% \), \( D = 1\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
