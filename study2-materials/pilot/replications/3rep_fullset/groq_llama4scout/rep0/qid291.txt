## Step 1: Understand the question and the topic
The question asks for the value of \( l \) in a system of simultaneous linear equations. The equations given are:
\( 2l + 3m = 13 \)
\( 3l + 4m = 17 \)
This topic is typically covered in UK maths curricula at GCSE level.

## 2: Solve the simultaneous equations for \( l \)
To solve for \( l \), we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, elimination seems straightforward:
Multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 gives:
\( 6l + 9m = 39 \)
\( 6l + 8m = 34 \)
Subtracting the second equation from the first:
\( (6l + 9m) - (6l + 8m) = 39 - 34 \)
\( m = 5 \)
Substituting \( m = 5 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( l \):
Using \( 2l + 3m = 13 \):
\( 2l + 3(5) = 13 \)
\( 2l + 15 = 13 \)
\( 2l = -2 \)
\( l = -1 \)

## 3: Analyze potential misconceptions and difficulties
A common misconception could involve incorrect handling of the equations, such as mistakenly subtracting or adding equations without properly adjusting coefficients, or errors in solving for one variable and then the other. However, the structure of this question and the solution method suggest that students who understand how to solve simultaneous equations should be able to arrive at the correct answer without significant difficulty.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with solving simultaneous equations. They might not know how to eliminate one of the variables or make algebraic mistakes. Given the straightforward nature of the solution once the method is applied correctly, but potentially confusing steps for those not confident, they might lean towards guessing or making significant errors. Option A (\( l = -1 \)) is actually correct, so if they do manage to stumble upon it or guess it, it might seem like a plausible choice, but overall, their understanding is likely too limited to make an accurate prediction without guessing.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding and can follow procedures. They might make occasional algebraic mistakes but generally can solve straightforward simultaneous equations. They are likely to get this right if they carefully follow the steps.

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of solving simultaneous equations and are less likely to make careless mistakes. They should easily solve for \( l \) and \( m \).

- **Advanced**: These students not only solve the equations correctly but might also do so with greater efficiency or by using more sophisticated methods.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each option
Given the correct answer is \( l = -1 \):
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (due to either correct solution by chance or actual calculation), B=20%, C=20%, D=20% (others might guess randomly).
- **Basic**: A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5% (most get it right).
- **Proficient**: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1% (almost all get it right).
- **Advanced**: A=99%, B=0.5%, C=0.25%, D=0.25% (virtually all get it right).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
