To solve this, let's first understand the question. The question presents a number line with -7 and -5 marked on it. There's an arrow from -7 to the right labeled +5, and then another arrow to the left labeled \( b \) ending at -5. The task is to find the value of \( b \).

## Step 1: Determine the position after the first move
Starting at -7 and moving +5 to the right places you at -2.

## 2: Understand the second move
From -2, moving to the left to -5 means you are moving -3.

## 3: Relate the second move to \( b \)
Since \( b \) represents the move to the left from -2 to -5, \( b = -3 \).

## 4: Analyze potential student errors
A common misconception could involve incorrect handling of negative numbers or misunderstanding the direction of movement on the number line. However, this question is relatively straightforward because it involves concrete movements on a number line.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding negative numbers and movements on a number line. They might incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the direction of \( b \), potentially leading to a higher chance of choosing incorrect options. Given the simplicity of the calculation once understood, they might guess or choose an option that seems "reasonable" in the context of negative numbers.

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to miscalculation or not fully understanding the implications of moving left or right on a number line with negative numbers.

- **Proficient:** These students are likely to understand the concept of moving on a number line and calculating with negative numbers. They should accurately determine \( b \) as -3.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately and efficiently. They would quickly and correctly identify \( b \) as -3.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each option
Given the straightforward nature of the problem once the concept is understood:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (misunderstanding the initial move), B=20% (random guess), C=30% (another guess), D=30% (correct, but through luck or partial understanding).
- **Basic:** A=10% (significant misunderstanding), B=15% (some calculation error), C=20% (another error), D=55% (correct understanding).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (minor error), B=5% (another minor error), C=10% (small mistake), D=80% (accurate calculation).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (very unlikely error), B=0% (unlikely), C=5% (extremely rare mistake), D=95% (highly accurate).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=20% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
