To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding related to units of volume.

The question revolves around the understanding that both litres and cubic meters (\(m^{3}\)) are units of volume. 

- Litres are commonly known as a unit of volume, especially in everyday contexts like the volume of liquids.
- \(m^{3}\) (cubic meters) is a unit of volume in the metric system, used for measuring larger volumes, such as the volume of a room.

The misconception here could be if a student does not recognize one or both of these as units of volume. However, given that both are standard units taught in school for measuring volume, the question seems straightforward.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks who is correct between Tom, who says litres is a unit of volume, and Katie, who says \(m^{3}\) is a unit of volume. The correct answer is that both Tom and Katie are correct because both litres and \(m^{3}\) are indeed units of volume.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A potential misconception could arise if students confuse units of volume with units of capacity or other measurements. However, litres and \(m^{3}\) are distinctly recognized as volume measurements, making this a relatively clear-cut question.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic unit recognition. They might not clearly understand what constitutes a unit of volume or might confuse litres with other units. Therefore, they might be more likely to choose incorrect options.
  - A (Only Tom): 20%
  - B (Only Katie): 20%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 40%
  - D (Neither is correct): 20%

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of measurement units. They are likely to recognize both litres and \(m^{3}\) as units of volume but might still make some errors due to lack of practice or misunderstanding.
  - A (Only Tom): 10%
  - B (Only Katie): 10%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 70%
  - D (Neither is correct): 10%

- **Proficient:** Students at this level have a solid grasp of measurement concepts, including units of volume. They are likely to accurately identify both litres and \(m^{3}\) as units of volume.
  - A (Only Tom): 5%
  - B (Only Katie): 5%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 85%
  - D (Neither is correct): 5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have an in-depth understanding and can apply concepts accurately. They would certainly recognize both litres and \(m^{3}\) as units of volume.
  - A (Only Tom): 2%
  - B (Only Katie): 2%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 95%
  - D (Neither is correct): 1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
