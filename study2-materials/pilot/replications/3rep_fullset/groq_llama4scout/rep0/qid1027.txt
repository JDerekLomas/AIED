## Step 1: Understand the sequence generation rule
The rule to generate a term-to-term sequence is given as: add 7, then divide by 2. This means to get from one term to the next, you add 7 and then divide the result by 2.

## 2: Apply the rule to find the relationship between terms
Let's denote the first term as \(x\). Applying the rule to get the second term: \(\frac{x + 7}{2}\).

## 3: Apply the rule again to get the third term
Applying the rule to the second term to get the third term: \(\frac{\frac{x + 7}{2} + 7}{2}\). Simplifying this gives: \(\frac{x + 7 + 14}{4} = \frac{x + 21}{4}\).

## 4: Use the given third term to solve for the first term
Given the third term is \(9\), we have: \(\frac{x + 21}{4} = 9\). Solving for \(x\), we multiply both sides by 4 to get: \(x + 21 = 36\). Then subtract 21 from both sides: \(x = 15\).

## 5: Analyze the question for potential misconceptions
The question requires working backward from the third term to find the first term, applying the given operations in reverse. A common misconception might involve misapplying the operations or not reversing them correctly.

## 6: Evaluate the difficulty and predict student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with applying the operations in reverse or understanding the sequence generation rule. They might incorrectly apply the operations or not fully understand how to solve for \(x\). Given the straightforward nature of the calculation once the correct steps are understood, but the potential for confusion in reversing the operations, we might expect a higher error rate. Option A seems correct based on calculation, so let's assume a significant portion gets it right but with a notable error rate: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of basic algebraic manipulations but might still make errors in reversing the sequence or in calculation. They are more likely to correctly identify the operations and apply them but could struggle with the algebraic manipulation: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic relationships and can apply operations correctly. They are likely to solve the problem accurately with minimal errors: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are not only proficient but can also handle more complex relationships and abstract thinking. They would easily solve this problem and are less likely to fall into common misconceptions: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
