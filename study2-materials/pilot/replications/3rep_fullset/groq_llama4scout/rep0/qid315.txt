## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at different ability levels (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) as the correct first step to express the given expression as a single fraction.

## 2: Analyze the question
The question requires finding a common denominator to combine the fractions \(\frac{3}{x-2}-\frac{5}{x}\). The correct approach involves finding a common denominator, which would be \(x(x-2)\), and then rewriting each fraction with this common denominator.

## 3: Evaluate option A
Option A suggests \(\frac{3-5}{x-2-x}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{-2}{-2} = 1\). This option incorrectly combines the fractions without finding a common denominator and is clearly incorrect.

## 4: Evaluate option B
Option B, \(\frac{3(x-2)}{x(x-2)}-\frac{5x}{x(x-2)}\), correctly identifies the common denominator as \(x(x-2)\) and properly rewrites each fraction with this denominator, making it a correct first step.

## 5: Evaluate option C
Option C, \(\frac{3x}{x(x-2)}-\frac{5(x-2)}{x(x-2)}\), also correctly identifies the common denominator \(x(x-2)\) but incorrectly multiplies the numerators. This would actually be a correct step if the numerators were correctly adjusted, but as presented, it seems to misunderstand the distribution.

## 6: Evaluate option D
Option D, \(9x - 5(x-2)\), does not even attempt to find a common denominator and seems to misinterpret the operation entirely, suggesting a completely incorrect approach.

## 7: Assess student understanding by ability level
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level are likely to struggle with algebraic manipulations and understanding of fractions. They might be tempted by simple or incorrect shortcuts. Option A might appeal due to its simplicity, but B and C represent more sophisticated understanding. Option D seems too confusing for this level.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and might recognize the need for a common denominator. They might struggle with the correct distribution and identification of the common denominator.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily identify the correct common denominator and apply it properly, likely choosing option B.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only choose the correct option but also quickly recognize the incorrect ones.

## 8: Predict student choices
Given the explanations:
- **Below_basic**: A=40% (simple but incorrect), B=20% (recognize correct process), C=10% (misunderstand), D=30% (confused).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=50%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=90%, C=5%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
