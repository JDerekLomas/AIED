To approach this question, let's analyze the concepts involved and the potential misconceptions.

Rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a shape can be rotated by a certain angle and still look the same. The order of rotational symmetry is the number of positions a shape can be rotated to look the same.

- A shape with rotational symmetry of order 1 can only be rotated by 360 degrees (or 0 degrees) to look the same, which essentially means it doesn't change under rotation, implying it's the same as having no rotational symmetry. All shapes have this property.
- A shape with rotational symmetry of order 3 can be rotated by 120 degrees (360/3) and still look the same.

## Step 1: Understanding the Claim of Tom
Tom claims some quadrilaterals have an order of rotational symmetry of 1. This is true because any quadrilateral that does not have rotational symmetry (such as most irregular quadrilaterals) essentially has an order of 1, as the only rotation that makes it look the same is a full 360-degree rotation.

## 2: Understanding the Claim of Katie
Katie claims some quadrilaterals have an order of rotational symmetry of 3. For a quadrilateral to have rotational symmetry of order 3, it must look the same after a rotation of 120 degrees. However, quadrilaterals cannot have rotational symmetry of order 3 because their internal angles and side lengths do not allow for it. Shapes with rotational symmetry of order 3 are typically equilateral triangles or regular polygons with 3-fold symmetry.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve misunderstanding what rotational symmetry means or not recognizing that quadrilaterals cannot have an order of rotational symmetry of 3 due to their geometric properties.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding rotational symmetry. They might incorrectly believe Katie could be right because they don't fully grasp the geometric constraints on quadrilaterals. Tom's statement might seem obvious, but Katie's seems less likely to be correct due to a lack of understanding. Hence, they might overestimate Katie's claim. 
  - A=60% (Tom is obviously right), B=20% (some might think Katie could be right due to misunderstanding), C=10% (unlikely to see both as correct), D=10% (neither correct seems too hard).

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding. They know Tom is correct because all shapes have order 1 symmetry. They also know that not all quadrilaterals can have higher-order symmetry like 3. So, they might be more inclined to correctly identify Tom but could still be misled by Katie's claim due to less deep understanding.
  - A=80% (clear Tom is right), B=10% (a few might still think Katie could be), C=5% (both correct seems unlikely), D=5% (neither seems unlikely).

- **Proficient:** These students understand rotational symmetry well. They know Tom is correct because all quadrilaterals have at least order 1. They also understand that quadrilaterals cannot have order 3 symmetry, making Katie incorrect.
  - A=90% (clearly Tom), B=5% (recognize Katie's error), C=3% (acknowledge both are not), D=2% (hardly anyone thinks neither).

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply it to abstract cases. They can easily see Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness.
  - A=95% (Tom's correctness), B=2% (highly unlikely Katie), C=2% (highly unlikely both), D=1% (almost none think neither).

The best answer is below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
