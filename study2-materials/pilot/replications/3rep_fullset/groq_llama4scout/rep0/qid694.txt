To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or areas of difficulty.

The question asks students to express the product of two fractions, \(\frac{1}{s} \times \frac{2}{t}\), as a single fraction, simplified as much as possible. The correct answer involves multiplying the numerators and denominators: \(\frac{1 \times 2}{s \times t} = \frac{2}{st}\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Answer
The correct procedure to solve the problem is to multiply the numerators together and the denominators together: \( \frac{1}{s} \times \frac{2}{t} = \frac{1 \times 2}{s \times t} = \frac{2}{st} \). This corresponds to option A.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve adding the fractions instead of multiplying them, or incorrectly adding the numerators and denominators. However, the structure of the question (\( \frac{1}{s} \times \frac{2}{t} \)) is straightforward for multiplication.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( \frac{t+2s}{st} \), suggests an addition of fractions or an incorrect manipulation, which is not directly relevant here since the operation given is multiplication, not addition.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{3}{s+t} \), implies adding the fractions \( \frac{1}{s} \) and \( \frac{2}{t} \) and then possibly incorrectly combining them, which is not applicable since the question specifies multiplication.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( \frac{3}{st} \), suggests an incorrect addition of the numerators (1+2=3) but keeping the correct denominator product, which might tempt some students if they mistakenly think the operation is addition.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic operations. They might incorrectly add numerators and denominators or not understand the operation, leading to a spread across incorrect options. However, the simplicity of the multiplication might still guide some to the correct answer. 
  - A: 40% (some understand basic multiplication)
  - B: 20% (addition misconception)
  - C: 20% (incorrect addition and combination)
  - D: 20% (incorrect numerator addition)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to get the correct answer but might be tempted by simple errors.
  - A: 70% (understand multiplication)
  - B: 15% (occasional mistake)
  - C: 10% (misconception about operations)
  - D: 5% (simple error)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make basic errors.
  - A: 90% (strong understanding of multiplication)
  - B: 5% (rare mistake)
  - C: 3% (uncommon misconception)
  - D: 2% (unlikely error)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and are unlikely to make mistakes on simple operations.
  - A: 98% (excellent understanding)
  - B: 1% (very rare mistake)
  - C: 0.5% (extremely unlikely)
  - D: 0.5% (extremely unlikely)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
