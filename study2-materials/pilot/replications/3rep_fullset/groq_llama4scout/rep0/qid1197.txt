To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question requires calculating the mean of the numbers 0, 0, 2, 6, 9. The correct calculation for the mean is to sum all the numbers and then divide by the count of numbers. So, the correct formula should be \(\frac{0+0+2+6+9}{5}\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Calculation
The correct calculation involves summing all the numbers (0+0+2+6+9) and then dividing by the total count of numbers, which is 5. This means the correct answer is not explicitly listed as A, B, or C but can be represented by an understanding that all numbers must be included in the sum and then divided by 5.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \(0+0+2+6+9 \div 5\). This option incorrectly suggests dividing only the 9 by 5 before adding the other numbers, which is not the correct order of operations for calculating the mean. However, it might attract students who misunderstand the order of operations or who are simply not paying close attention.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \(\frac{2+6+9}{5}\). This option ignores the two 0s, which is a common misconception when calculating means - forgetting to include all the data points.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \(\frac{2+6+9}{3}\). This option not only ignores the two 0s but also incorrectly uses 3 as the divisor instead of 5, compounding two errors.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D states "None of them," which would be correct if none of the provided calculations (A, B, C) accurately represents the correct method for calculating the mean of the given set of numbers.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of mean or might struggle with basic arithmetic. They could be attracted to A because it seems to involve adding and dividing, but they might not notice the incorrect order of operations. B and C might also seem plausible to some as they involve simple arithmetic operations. However, given the straightforward nature of the question, more might realize the mistake in B and C. 
  - A: 30%
  - B: 20%
  - C: 20%
  - D: 30%

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes. They are less likely to choose B or C because they should recognize the importance of including all numbers. A might still seem viable due to its appearance of involving all steps, but they should be more inclined to recognize D as correct.
  - A: 20%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 65%

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of calculating the mean. They should easily identify that A, B, and C are incorrect and choose D.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 2%
  - C: 1%
  - D: 92%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand how to calculate the mean but also can quickly assess the validity of given options. They will almost unanimously choose D.
  - A: 1%
  - B: 1%
  - C: 0%
  - D: 98%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=1% D=92%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=0% D=98%
