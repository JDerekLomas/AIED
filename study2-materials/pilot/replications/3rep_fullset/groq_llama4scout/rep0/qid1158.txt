To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the equations provided.

The question asks to identify which of the given equations has exactly one solution. This requires understanding the nature of solutions to quadratic equations, specifically the conditions under which a quadratic equation has one, two, or no real solutions.

## Step 1: Understanding Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation in the form of \(at^2 + bt + c = 0\) has a discriminant \(D = b^2 - 4ac\). The nature of its roots (solutions) depends on \(D\): if \(D > 0\), there are two distinct real roots; if \(D = 0\), there is exactly one real root; and if \(D < 0\), there are no real roots.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \(t^2 - 9t = 0\). This can be factored as \(t(t - 9) = 0\), which gives two solutions: \(t = 0\) and \(t = 9\). So, it does not have exactly one solution.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \(t^2 + 6t + 9 = 0\). This can be factored as \((t + 3)^2 = 0\), which means it has exactly one solution: \(t = -3\).

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \(t^2 - 6t - 9 = 0\). Using the discriminant \(D = b^2 - 4ac = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(-9) = 36 + 36 = 72 > 0\), it has two distinct real roots. So, it does not have exactly one solution.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \(t^2 - 9 = 0\). This gives \(t^2 = 9\), which has two solutions: \(t = 3\) and \(t = -3\). So, it does not have exactly one solution.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with factoring and understanding the discriminant. They might mistakenly choose equations that seem simpler or more familiar. Option B is straightforward to solve by inspection or simple factoring, making it likely for students to identify it as having one solution once they factor it. However, the concept of exactly one solution might confuse them, leading to random or incorrect choices. 
  - A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of solving quadratic equations. They should easily identify Option B as having one solution. They might make careless mistakes or not fully understand the implications of the discriminant.
  - A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%

- **Proficient**: These students understand quadratic equations well and can apply the discriminant or factoring to solve them. They should confidently choose Option B.
  - A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only solve the equations correctly but also understand the theoretical background. They will quickly identify Option B and may even solve the others to confirm.
  - A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
