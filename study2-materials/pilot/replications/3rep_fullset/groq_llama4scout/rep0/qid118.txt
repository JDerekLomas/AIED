## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to identify the correct value to replace the star (*) in the formula for calculating the area of a trapezium. The formula for the area of a trapezium is \( \text{Area} = \frac{a + b}{2} \times h \), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \(h\) is the perpendicular height.

## 2: Identifying Given Values
Given that the parallel sides of the trapezium are 90mm and 40mm, and the perpendicular height is 5cm, we first need to ensure all measurements are in the same unit. The height given is 5cm, which is 50mm.

## 3: Applying the Formula
Substituting the given values into the formula: \( \text{Area} = \frac{90 + 40}{2} \times 50 \).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
A common misconception could be using the length of one of the non-parallel sides (slanted sides) as the height, but in this case, the height is clearly given as 5cm (or 50mm), and it's perpendicular, which should help students identify it correctly.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with unit conversions and identifying the correct components of the formula. They might confuse the slanted side (6cm) with the height or get the calculation wrong. Thus, they might choose C (6) because it's a measurement they see and seems relevant, or they might not know how to apply the formula correctly. A=10%, B=20%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a good grasp of the formula but might still make errors in unit conversion or identifying the height. They are more likely to recognize the height as 50mm and choose B. A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily identify the height as 50mm and have no issues with the formula. They are likely to choose B (50) as it's directly derived from understanding the formula and the given measurements. A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will not only understand the formula but also be able to apply it with complex measurements. They should all choose B (50) without any confusion. A=0%, B=100%, C=0%, D=0%.

## 6: Formatting the Response
Given the analysis, the predicted percentages for each ability level are as follows:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
