To approach this question, let's consider what makes a polygon and the common misconceptions associated with the definition of a polygon. A polygon is defined as a 2D shape with at least three sides, where all the sides are straight.

## Step 1: Understanding Polygons
Tom's example is a triangle, which is indeed a polygon because it has three straight sides. Katie's example is a semi-circle, which is not a polygon because it has a curved side.

## 2: Identifying Misconceptions
A common misconception might be that a shape with curved sides can be considered a polygon if it has a certain number of sides or if it "looks" polygonal. However, the definition is strict: all sides must be straight.

## 3: Analyzing the Question
The question directly tests the understanding of the polygon definition, particularly with the contrast between a clear polygon (triangle) and a shape that is not a polygon (semi-circle). This contrast is stark, making it less likely for students to confuse the semi-circle with a polygon due to its obvious curvature.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the definition of a polygon or might confuse it with other geometric properties. They might think both are polygons because they don't fully grasp the "straight sides" criterion. So, they could lean towards $C=40\%$ (Both Tom and Katie) or $D=30\%$ (Neither is correct), with $A=15\%$ and $B=15\%$. A possible distribution could be: $A=20\%$, $B=10\%$, $C=40\%$, $D=30\%$.
- **Basic:** Basic level students are more likely to understand that a triangle is a polygon but might still be uncertain about the semi-circle. They might choose $A=60\%$ (Only Tom) as the safest option, with some thinking Katie could be right due to lack of clarity on what constitutes a polygon. So, $A=60\%$, $B=10\%$, $C=20\%$, $D=10\%$.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students clearly understand that a polygon must have straight sides. They will easily identify Tom's example as a polygon and Katie's as not. They are likely to choose $A=80\%$ (Only Tom), with $C=10\%$, $B=5\%$, and $D=5\%$.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students have a deep understanding and will not confuse a semi-circle with a polygon. They'll quickly identify Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect. Thus, $A=90\%$, $B=5\%$, $C=3\%$, $D=2\%$.

Given these analyses and adjusting for a more realistic distribution based on common student misunderstandings and the clarity of the question:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
