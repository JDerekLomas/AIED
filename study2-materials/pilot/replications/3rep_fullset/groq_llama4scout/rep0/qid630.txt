To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question.

The formula for the area of a triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\). Given that the base of the triangle is \(\sqrt{144} \, \text{cm}\) and the height is \(6 \, \text{cm}\), we can substitute these values into the formula.

First, simplify \(\sqrt{144}\) to \(12\) because \(\sqrt{144} = 12\).

So, the area \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 6 = 36 \, \text{cm}^2\).

## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential for misconception
The question provides a triangle with a base of \(\sqrt{144} \, \text{cm}\) (which simplifies to \(12 \, \text{cm}\)) and a height of \(6 \, \text{cm}\). The correct calculation yields an area of \(36 \, \text{cm}^2\).

## 2: Analyze the options given
- A: \(144 \, \text{cm}^2\)
- B: \(72 \, \text{cm}^2\)
- C: \(36 \, \text{cm}^2\)
- D: \(5184 \, \text{cm}^2\)

## 3: Consider common misconceptions
A common misconception might involve forgetting the \(\frac{1}{2}\) in the area formula or misinterpreting the base and height. However, given that the base simplifies to a whole number and the numbers are relatively simple, the main error would likely come from miscalculation or not simplifying \(\sqrt{144}\) correctly.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with simplifying \(\sqrt{144}\) or applying the formula correctly. They might choose A if they forget \(\frac{1}{2}\) or miscalculate. D seems unlikely as it involves a large number not easily derived from simple multiplication. B could be a guess. This group might have a higher chance of picking A or D due to miscalculation.
- **Basic**: Students here should understand the formula but might make calculation errors. They are likely to get it right or choose B if they forget \(\frac{1}{2}\).
- **Proficient**: These students should easily calculate the area correctly, choosing C. They are less likely to make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- **Advanced**: This group should also easily calculate the correct answer, likely choosing C, with minimal chance of error.

## 5: Estimate percentages
Given the simplicity of the numbers once \(\sqrt{144}\) is simplified, and assuming most students can simplify \(\sqrt{144}\) to 12:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (forgetting 1/2), B=20% (miscalculation), C=40% (getting it right by chance or correct calculation), D=10% (unlikely but possible mistake).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=20%, C=65%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=90%, D=0%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=100%, D=0%.

The best answer is C.
