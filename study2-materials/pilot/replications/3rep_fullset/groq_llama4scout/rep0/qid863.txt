To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \frac{1}{2} \times 3= \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question involves multiplying a fraction by a whole number, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics. The correct calculation is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 3 = \frac{1 \times 3}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrectly applying the multiplication, such as multiplying the denominator by the whole number instead of the numerator, or adding instead of multiplying. However, given the simplicity of this specific question, the most straightforward error would be to forget to convert the result into a mixed number or to miscalculate the product.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \( \frac{3}{2} \), is the correct answer. Students who understand how to multiply a fraction by a whole number should select this option.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( 3 \frac{1}{2} \), might seem plausible to students who are not paying close attention or who are used to seeing answers in mixed number form but haven't fully grasped the operation. However, this would actually represent \( \frac{7}{2} \), not \( \frac{3}{2} \), and doesn't directly relate to a simple multiplication error.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{3}{6} \), could be a result of a student thinking they need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3, which would be an incorrect application of the rules.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( \frac{1}{6} \), suggests a misunderstanding where the student might be dividing instead of multiplying or applying an incorrect operation.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic operations. They might incorrectly choose B, C, or D due to a lack of understanding of fraction multiplication. A: 20% (guessing or very basic understanding), B: 30% (misunderstanding of operations), C: 30% (incorrectly applying rules), D: 20% (completely off).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes. A: 60%, B: 20%, C: 10%, D: 10%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make simple errors. A: 90%, B: 5%, C: 3%, D: 2%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts accurately without errors. A: 98%, B: 1%, C: 0.5%, D: 0.5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
