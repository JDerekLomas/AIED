To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions involved.

The question focuses on alternate angles, which are a concept in geometry related to lines and angles. When two lines are intersected by a transversal, alternate angles are those that are on opposite sides of the transversal and on the outside of the two lines. A common misconception among students is confusing alternate angles with corresponding angles or not fully understanding the conditions under which angles are considered alternate (i.e., the lines must be parallel for alternate angles to be equal).

Given the scenario:
- Tom says angles \( p \) and \( q \) are alternate.
- Katie says angles \( p \) and \( q \) are equal.

The diagram provided shows two non-parallel lines intersected by another line, with angles \( p \) and \( q \) both on the outside of the lines and on opposite sides of the transversal.

## Step 1: Understanding Alternate Angles
Alternate angles are equal if the two lines intersected by the transversal are parallel. However, if the lines are not parallel, the angles are still alternate but not equal.

## 2: Analyzing the Diagram and Statements
The diagram clearly shows that lines are not parallel, and angles \( p \) and \( q \) are indeed on opposite sides of the transversal and outside the two lines, making them alternate angles. However, because the lines are not parallel, \( p \) and \( q \) are not equal.

## 3: Evaluating Tom's Statement
Tom correctly identifies that \( p \) and \( q \) are alternate angles based on their position relative to the transversal.

## 4: Evaluating Katie's Statement
Katie claims \( p \) and \( q \) are equal, which would only be true if the two lines were parallel. Since the lines are not parallel, Katie is incorrect.

## 5: Conclusion
Tom is correct that \( p \) and \( q \) are alternate angles. Katie is incorrect that \( p \) and \( q \) are equal because the lines are not parallel. Therefore, only Tom is correct.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric concepts. They might incorrectly assume Katie is right because they don't understand the condition for equality (parallel lines), or they might not understand what alternate angles are. 
  - A (Only Tom) = 20%, B (Only Katie) = 40%, C (Both Tom and Katie) = 20%, D (Neither is correct) = 20%
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still confuse concepts. They are more likely to recognize Tom's correctness but might still be tricked into thinking Katie could be right under certain conditions.
  - A = 50%, B = 30%, C = 10%, D = 10%
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to confuse them. They know Tom is correct about \( p \) and \( q \) being alternate and understand Katie's mistake.
  - A = 80%, B = 15%, C = 3%, D = 2%
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts accurately. They will easily identify Tom's correctness and Katie's mistake.
  - A = 95%, B = 4%, C = 1%, D = 0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
