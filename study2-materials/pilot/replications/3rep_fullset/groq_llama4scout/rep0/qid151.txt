To tackle this, let's analyze the question and the sequence provided: \(4, 10, 14, 24, \ldots\).

## Step 1: Identify the Pattern
First, let's examine the sequence for a recognizable pattern. The differences between successive terms are \(10 - 4 = 6\), \(14 - 10 = 4\), and \(24 - 14 = 10\). There isn't a simple arithmetic progression (where a constant is added each time) because the differences between terms are not constant.

## 2: Analyze Option A
Option A suggests that to get the next term, you add \(6\) to the previous term. Let's test this with the given sequence: starting from \(4\), adding \(6\) gives \(10\); from \(10\), adding \(6\) gives \(16\), not \(14\); so, option A is incorrect.

## 3: Analyze Option B
Option B suggests that to get the next term, you add the previous two terms together. Testing this: \(4 + 10 = 14\) (matches the third term), \(10 + 14 = 24\) (matches the fourth term), and \(14 + 24 = 38\). The sequence provided does not continue with \(38\), but let's see if this holds as a potential rule: The sequence given is \(4, 10, 14, 24\), and if we apply the rule, the next term would indeed be \(14 + 24 = 38\), which wasn't provided but let's check if it fits any common sequence type.

## 4: Analyze Option C
Option C suggests doubling the previous term and adding \(2\): For \(4\), \(4 \times 2 + 2 = 10\); for \(10\), \(10 \times 2 + 2 = 22\), not \(14\); so, option C is incorrect.

## 5: Analyze Option D
Option D suggests multiplying the previous term by \(3\) and subtracting \(2\): For \(4\), \(4 \times 3 - 2 = 10\); for \(10\), \(10 \times 3 - 2 = 28\), not \(14\); so, option D is incorrect.

## 6: Evaluate Student Responses
Given the analysis, the correct answer seems to be option B, as it fits the sequence provided: \(4, 10, 14, 24, \ldots\) could be formed by adding the previous two terms (\(4+10=14\), \(10+14=24\), etc.).

## 7: Predict Student Performance
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to identify patterns or might not engage deeply with the question. They might be attracted to simple or obvious rules like adding a constant (Option A), so \(A = 40\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 15\%\), \(D = 25\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here might have a bit more understanding but could still be misled by straightforward calculations or common misconceptions. They might consider Option A more seriously but could also consider B with some guidance, so \(A = 30\%\), \(B = 35\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 15\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to analyze the sequence effectively and notice that Option B fits perfectly. They might still consider other options but should quickly dismiss them, so \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 70\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only identify B as correct but also quickly eliminate other options through logical deduction. They might spend less time on A, C, and D, so \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 85\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=35% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
