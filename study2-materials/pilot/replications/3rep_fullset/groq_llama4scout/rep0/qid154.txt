## Step 1: Understand the question and the graph
The question provides a displacement-time graph representing the start of Mo's journey home. The graph shows a straight line from (0,60) to (3,0) on the time and distance axes, respectively, but scaled differently. The task is to find the coordinates of a marked point on the graph, given that Mo traveled at a speed of \(4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\).

## 2: Determine the scale of the graph
First, we need to establish the scale. The line goes from 60 meters to 0 meters over 3 seconds (since it touches the time axis three squares from the origin). This implies a constant speed, which can be calculated to confirm consistency with the given speed of \(4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\). The distance covered in 3 seconds is 60 meters, so the speed is \(60 \mathrm{~m} / 3 \mathrm{~s} = 20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\), but we're given the speed is \(4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\), suggesting a need to reassess the graph's scaling based on the question's specifics.

## 3: Reassess the graph with given speed
Given Mo travels at \(4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\), and assuming the graph's y-axis (distance) and x-axis (time) are correctly interpreted: if in 3 seconds Mo would cover 60 meters at \(20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\), at \(4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\), he covers 12 meters in 3 seconds. This implies the marked point, being 1 second in, would see a distance traveled of \(4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} * 1 \mathrm{~s} = 4\) meters from 60 meters, placing it at 56 meters, not directly helping without time axis scaling.

## 4: Analyze the marked point
The marked point is described as being at 40 meters on the distance axis and one square in on the time axis. The distance axis clearly marks 40 meters. To use the speed: in \(t\) seconds, Mo travels \(4t\) meters. So, if he's at 40 meters, he's traveled \(60 - 40 = 20\) meters. Using \(4t = 20\), we find \(t = 5\) seconds.
