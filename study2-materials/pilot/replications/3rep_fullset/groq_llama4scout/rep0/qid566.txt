To approach this question, let's analyze the two statements given by Tom and Katie and evaluate their correctness based on mathematical principles.

Tom says a correct first line of working could be: \( p^{2}=5-q \).

This is a correct manipulation. Starting with \( p=\sqrt{5-q} \), squaring both sides gives \( p^{2}=(\sqrt{5-q})^{2}=5-q \), which is a valid algebraic step.

Katie says a correct first line of working could be: \( p+\sqrt{q}=\sqrt{5} \).

This is not a correct manipulation. There's no standard algebraic operation that would lead directly from \( p=\sqrt{5-q} \) to \( p+\sqrt{q}=\sqrt{5} \) without additional, incorrect steps. The original equation does not support adding \( \sqrt{q} \) to both sides in a manner that results in \( p+\sqrt{q}=\sqrt{5} \).

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Statement(s)
Tom's statement is correct because squaring both sides of \( p=\sqrt{5-q} \) indeed yields \( p^{2}=5-q \). Katie's statement is incorrect because it does not logically follow from the original equation \( p=\sqrt{5-q} \).

## 2: Analyze Potential Student Errors
Students might struggle with identifying the correct algebraic manipulation, especially if they are not confident in their ability to rearrange equations or if they have a misconception about how equations can be transformed.

## 3: Assess Difficulty by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations and could potentially choose any option based on guesswork or a flawed understanding. They might incorrectly validate Katie's statement due to a lack of understanding of proper algebraic manipulations.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with more complex manipulations. They are likely to recognize Tom's correctness but might be misled by Katie's statement, especially if they don't see the flaw immediately.
- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of algebra and should easily identify Tom's statement as correct and Katie's as incorrect.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the algebraic manipulations but also can quickly assess the validity of each statement. They should have no trouble identifying Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
Given the nature of the question:
- **Below Basic:** A=60% (assuming many would incorrectly think Tom is correct without fully understanding), B=20% (some might think Katie is correct due to confusion), C=10% (few would see both are correct), D=10% (few would correctly identify neither as correct based on the misunderstanding).
- **Basic:** A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%
- **Proficient:** A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%
- **Advanced:** A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%

Converting these insights into specific percentages as requested:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
