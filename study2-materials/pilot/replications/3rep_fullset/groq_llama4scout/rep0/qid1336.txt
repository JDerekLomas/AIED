To approach this question, let's first understand what is being asked. The task is to determine who, between Tom and Katie, is correct in their method to eliminate \(y\) from the given pair of simultaneous equations:

\((1)\) \(-2x + 6y = 4\)

\((2)\) \(x + 2y = 8\)

To eliminate \(y\), the coefficients of \(y\) in both equations must be the same but with opposite signs.

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's suggestion
Tom suggests multiplying equation \((2)\) by \(3\). This would result in:
\((2')\) \(3x + 6y = 24\)

Now, comparing the coefficients of \(y\) in \((1)\) and \((2')\), we see they are the same (\(6y\)), but to eliminate \(y\), we would need one to be \(-6y\) and the other \(6y\). Since equation \((1)\) is \(-2x + 6y = 4\), multiplying it by \(-1\) would give \(2x - 6y = -4\), and then it could be directly compared to \((2')\), but Tom only suggested modifying \((2)\). So, let's see if it aligns with eliminating \(y\) directly:
- The \(y\) coefficients are \(6\) in both, so no direct elimination by just changing one equation.

## 2: Analyze Katie's suggestion
Katie suggests multiplying equation \((1)\) by \(2\) and equation \((2)\) by \(6\). 
- Multiplying \((1)\) by \(2\): \(-4x + 12y = 8\)
- Multiplying \((2)\) by \(6\): \(6x + 12y = 48\)

Now, the coefficients of \(y\) are the same (\(12y\)), which means \(y\) can be eliminated by subtracting one equation from the other.

## 3: Evaluate Tom's Method Correctness
For Tom to be correct, his method must allow for the elimination of \(y\). Multiplying \((2)\) by \(3\) gives \(3x + 6y = 24\). To eliminate \(y\), we compare \(-2x + 6y = 4\) and \(3x + 6y = 24\); subtracting one from the other would eliminate \(y\):
\((-2x + 6y) - (3x + 6y) = 4 - 24\)
\(-5x = -20\)
\(x = 4\)

So, Tom's method does work for eliminating \(y\).

## 4: Evaluate Katie's Method Correctness
Katie's method, as shown, also works for eliminating \(y\) by making the coefficients of \(y\) equal.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of eliminating \(y\) and could easily be confused by the suggestions. They might not fully understand the requirement for the \(y\) coefficients to be opposites or equal. 
  - A=20% (some might think Tom is right because it's a simple multiplication), B=20% (similar reasoning for Katie), C=30% (if they see both can work), D=30% (if they don't understand either method).

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebraic manipulations but might not always see the most efficient path.
  - A=30%, B=30%, C=30%, D=10% (as they would start to understand the logic behind eliminating \(y\)).

- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic methods well and can analyze suggestions.
  - A=40%, B=20%, C=30%, D=10% (recognizing both have viable methods, but might see one as more straightforward).

- **Advanced**: Students here are adept at quickly analyzing and solving problems.
  - A=10%, B=10%, C=70%, D=10% (quickly seeing both methods can work, with a preference for efficiency).

## 6: Conclusion
Based on understanding and the likely confusion or clarity at each level:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- basic: A=30% B=30% C=30% D=10%
- proficient: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
- advanced: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=30% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
advanced: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
