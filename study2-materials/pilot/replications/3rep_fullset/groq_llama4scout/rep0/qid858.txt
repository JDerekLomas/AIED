To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the problems and the common misconceptions or areas of difficulty students might have.

## Step 1: Understanding the Problems
Problem P is \( (4+5)^{2} \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5^{2} \). The task is to determine the order of operations for each problem.

## 2: Order of Operations
The standard order of operations is Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.

## 3: Analyzing Problem P
For Problem P, \( (4+5)^{2} \), according to the order of operations, the calculation inside the parentheses should be done first: \( 4+5 \). Then, the result should be squared. So, the correct order is to calculate \( 4+5 \) first.

## 4: Analyzing Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5^{2} \), following the order of operations, exponents should be evaluated before addition. So, \( 5^{2} \) should be calculated first.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might think that in both cases, they should just add or perform operations from left to right without considering the parentheses or exponents properly.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of the order of operations but might make mistakes if the expressions are complex or if they misunderstand the application of the rules.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand and can apply the order of operations correctly. They should identify that for Problem P, \( 4+5 \) should be done first, and for Problem Q, \( 5^{2} \) should be done first.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the order of operations but can also apply it in more complex scenarios and have a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: 
  - A (Both \( 4+5 \)): 60% (assuming they ignore the exponent and just add)
  - B (P: \( 4+5 \), Q: \( 5^{2} \)): 20% (some might get one right but not the other)
  - C (P: \( 5^{2} \), Q: \( 4+5 \)): 10%
  - D (Both \( 5^{2} \)): 10%
- **Basic**:
  - A: 30% (might not understand the difference)
  - B: 60% (understand the basic operations but might make small mistakes)
  - C: 5%
  - D: 5%
- **Proficient**:
  - A: 5%
  - B: 90% (correctly apply the order of operations)
  - C: 3%
  - D: 2%
- **Advanced**:
  - A: 0%
  - B: 98% (clear understanding and application)
  - C: 1%
  - D: 1%

The best answer is B.
