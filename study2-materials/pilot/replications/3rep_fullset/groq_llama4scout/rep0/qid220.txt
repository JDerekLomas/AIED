## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question involves enlarging a triangle by a scale factor of 3, with the centre of enlargement at (1,0), and finding the new coordinates of the point marked T, which is initially at (3,1).

## 2: Recall the Formula for Enlargement
To enlarge a point by a scale factor of \(k\) with the centre of enlargement at \((h, j)\), the new coordinates \((x', y')\) of a point \((x, y)\) are given by:
\[x' = h + k(x - h)\]
\[y' = j + k(y - j)\]
Substituting \(k = 3\), \((h, j) = (1, 0)\), and \((x, y) = (3, 1)\) into the formula gives:
\[x' = 1 + 3(3 - 1) = 1 + 3 \cdot 2 = 1 + 6 = 7\]
\[y' = 0 + 3(1 - 0) = 0 + 3 \cdot 1 = 3\]
So, the new coordinates of T are \((7, 3)\).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A common misconception could be not using the centre of enlargement correctly or misunderstanding the scale factor's application.
- Another error might be in calculating the distances or applying the scale factor incorrectly.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of enlargement and calculating new coordinates. They might not apply the formula correctly or misunderstand the scale factor and centre of enlargement. Option A (7,3) is the correct answer, but these students might choose B (1,3) if they don't understand the effect of the scale factor on the point's distance from the centre of enlargement, or they might choose D (9,3) if they incorrectly calculate the new x-coordinate.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: Given the challenge, let's assume most would struggle, so A=40% (correct), B=20%, C=10%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a better grasp of the concepts but might still make careless errors. So, A=70%, B=15%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make errors. So, A=90%, B=5%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: Students here are very confident and accurate. So, A=95%, B=2%, C=1%, D=2%.

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Given the specific question and the mathematical operations required, the predictions are:
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
- **basic**: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
