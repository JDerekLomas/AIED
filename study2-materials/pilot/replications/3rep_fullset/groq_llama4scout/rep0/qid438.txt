## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question presents a velocity-time graph representing the first 5 seconds of Mo's journey, which starts at home. The task is to determine at what time Mo first started traveling at \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \).

## 2: Analyzing the graph
The graph has three sections: 
1. A straight line from (0,0) to (1,4), indicating an increase in velocity from 0 to \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) over the first second.
2. A horizontal line from (1,4) to (3,4), showing a constant velocity of \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) from 1 to 3 seconds.
3. A slanted line from (3,4) to (5,0), indicating a decrease in velocity from \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) to 0 over the next 2 seconds.

## 3: Identifying the time Mo first travels at \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \)
From the graph, Mo starts traveling at \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) at \( t = 1 \) second because that's when the velocity first reaches \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) and stays constant at that value until \( t = 3 \) seconds.

## 4: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to read the graph or understand the concept of velocity. They might incorrectly identify the time or not understand what the question is asking. Given the simplicity of the graph and the question, most might still be able to see the velocity reaches 4 m/s at 1 second, but there could be confusion. A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to read the graph and understand basic concepts of velocity. They should see that the velocity first reaches \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) at 1 second. A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a good understanding of graphs and velocity. They should easily identify that Mo first starts traveling at \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) at \( t = 1 \) second. A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will have a deep understanding of the concepts and should have no trouble identifying the correct time. A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

## 5: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the predicted percentages for each ability level are as follows:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
