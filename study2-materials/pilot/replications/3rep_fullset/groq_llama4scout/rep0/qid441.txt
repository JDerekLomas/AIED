## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for calculating the total surface area of a given cuboid.

## 2: Analyze the question
The cuboid has dimensions: top measures 4cm by 2cm, and the height is 7cm. The formula for the total surface area (TSA) of a cuboid is \( TSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh \), where \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \) are length, width, and height, respectively.

## 3: Apply the formula to the given cuboid
Substituting the given values: \( l = 4 \) cm, \( w = 2 \) cm, and \( h = 7 \) cm into the formula gives:
\[ TSA = 2(4 \times 2) + 2(4 \times 7) + 2(2 \times 7) \]
\[ TSA = 2(8) + 2(28) + 2(14) \]
\[ TSA = 16 + 56 + 28 \]
\[ TSA = 100 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \]

## 4: Evaluate each option
- A: \( (2 \times 7) + (4 \times 2) + (4 \times 7) \) calculates the area of three faces, not the total surface area. This seems to be a common error where students forget to multiply by 2.
- B: \( [(2 \times 7) + (4 \times 2) + (4 \times 7)] \times 2 \) correctly calculates the total surface area by summing the areas of three faces and then multiplying by 2.
- C: \( (2 \times 7) \times (4 \times 2) \times (4 \times 7) \) is clearly incorrect as it multiplies the areas of the faces together, not summing them.
- D: \( 2 \times 4 \times 7 \) calculates the volume, not the surface area.

## 5: Predict student responses
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of surface area and the formula. They might choose D (volume) or C (incorrect multiplication), but are less likely to identify B as correct due to a lack of understanding. A might seem correct but lacks the multiplication by 2. Prediction: A=30% (thinking it's a face area), B=20% (some understanding but not clear), C=30% (random or multiplication error), D=20% (confusing with volume).
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding and might realize A is not enough but could be confused about multiplying by 2. They might lean towards B but could also choose A. Prediction: A=40% (common mistake), B=40% (correct understanding), C=10% (less likely now), D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept and formula. They are likely to choose B. Prediction: A=10% (error), B=80% (correct), C=5% ( unlikely), D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp and are unlikely to make basic errors. Prediction: A=0% (error recognized), B=90% (correct), C=5% (very unlikely), D=5%.

## 6: Finalize predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- **basic**: A=40% B=40% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=40% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
