To approach this question, let's consider what reflecting a point across a line means. When a point is reflected across a line, the line acts as a mirror. The distance of the point from the line remains the same on the other side, but in the opposite direction.

## Step 1: Understanding the Reflection Concept
The point \( Q \) has coordinates \( (2,5) \), and it needs to be reflected across the line \( x = 2 \). This line is a vertical line passing through the point (2,0).

## 2: Analyzing the Reflection Across \( x = 2 \)
Since the line of reflection \( x = 2 \) is vertical and the point \( Q \) is on this line (\( x = 2 \)), reflecting \( Q \) across \( x = 2 \) does not change its position. The new coordinates remain \( (2,5) \).

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the type of line (vertical or horizontal) or not understanding that reflection across a line that passes through the point does not change the point's coordinates.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of reflection or might not even attempt to apply it correctly. They might choose an option that seems like a simple transformation or no transformation at all. Given the simplicity of the question and the fact that \( Q \) lies on \( x = 2 \), A=80% (correct, as no change), B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of coordinates and might have been introduced to simple transformations. They are likely to understand that reflecting across \( x = 2 \) doesn't change the x-coordinate but might struggle with applying this correctly if the concept isn't solid. A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of coordinate geometry and transformations. They should easily recognize that reflecting a point on the line of reflection results in no change. A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concept but can apply it with ease and might even be able to generalize it to more complex scenarios. For them, this question is straightforward. A=98%, B=1%, C=1%, D=0%.

## 5: Formatting the Response
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- basic: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- proficient: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
- advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
