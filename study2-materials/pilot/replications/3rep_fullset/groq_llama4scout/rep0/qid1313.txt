To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question step by step.

The question requires students to understand function machines, which are a common topic in UK maths curricula. The task is to identify which pair of function machines are correct based on their operations.

## Step 1: Understanding Function Machines
Function machines take an input, apply a series of operations, and produce an output. The operations are applied in a specific order. For example, for the input \(a\), the operations \(a \rightarrow \times 3 \rightarrow +4\) result in \(3a + 4\).

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A presents:
1. \(a \rightarrow \times 3 \rightarrow +4 \rightarrow 4 + 3a\)
2. \(a \rightarrow +4 \rightarrow \times 3 \rightarrow 3(4 + a)\)

Let's verify:
1. \(a \times 3 = 3a\), then \(3a + 4\), which matches \(4 + 3a\) if we rearrange, suggesting a potential mistake in the representation. Correctly, it should reflect the operations' outcomes directly.
2. \(a + 4\), then \((a + 4) \times 3 = 3a + 12\), not \(3(4 + a) = 12 + 3a\), which actually matches.

## 3: Detailed Verification of Each Option
- **Option A**: 
  1. The first machine: \(a \rightarrow \times 3 \rightarrow +4\) yields \(3a + 4\), not \(4 + 3a\), which seems incorrect based on order of operations.
  2. The second machine: \(a \rightarrow +4 \rightarrow \times 3\) yields \(3(a + 4) = 3a + 12\), which is equivalent to \(3(4 + a)\).

- **Option B**: 
  1. \(a \rightarrow \times 3 \rightarrow +4\) yields \(3a + 4\).
  2. \(a \rightarrow \times 3 \rightarrow +4\) yields \(3a + 4\), not \(3(4 + a)\).

- **Option C**: 
  1. \(a \rightarrow +4 \rightarrow \times 3\) yields \(3(a + 4) = 3a + 12\).
  2. \(a \rightarrow \times 3 \rightarrow +4\) yields \(3a + 4\), not \(-3(4 + a) = -12 - 3a\).

- **Option D**: 
  1. \(a \rightarrow +4 \rightarrow \times 3\) yields \(3(a + 4) = 3a + 12\), which does not match \(4 + 3a\).
  2. \(a \rightarrow +4 \rightarrow \times 3\) yields \(3(a + 4) = 3a + 12\), which matches \(3(4 + a)\).

## 4: Identifying the Correct Option
The correct option must accurately reflect the composition of functions. Let's correct and simplify the analysis based on standard function machine operations:
- The only option that accurately represents correct function machine operations without error in calculation or representation is **Option D**, as it correctly states:
  1. \(a \rightarrow +4 = a + 4\), then \(\times 3 = 3(a + 4) = 3a + 12\), which matches the form \(4 + 3a\) if considering a potential typo or misinterpretation in initial analysis. Actually, \(a + 4\) then \(\times 3\) gives \(3a + 12\), and \(3(4 + a) = 12 + 3a\), showing **D** could be correct based on accurate calculation.

## 5: Prediction of Student Responses
Given the complexity and the common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic**: Students might not understand function machines well. They might randomly select or choose based on superficial similarities. **A=30%, B=20%, C=20%, D=30%**
- **Basic**: Students understand the basics but might struggle with applying operations in sequence correctly. **A=20%, B=30%, C=15%, D=35%**
- **Proficient**: Students are likely to understand and apply the operations correctly. **A=10%, B=15%, C=5%, D=70%**
- **Advanced**: Students will quickly and accurately assess each option. **A=0%, B=5%, C=0%, D=95%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=
