## Step 1: Understand the question and the algebraic expansion required
The question requires students to expand and simplify the expression \((p-5)(p+2)\) and then compare it to \(p^{2} \triangle p \bigcirc\) to find the value that should replace the circle (\(\bigcirc\)). The expansion of \((p-5)(p+2)\) is \(p^{2} + 2p - 5p - 10 = p^{2} - 3p - 10\).

## 2: Identify the target algebraic form
The target form given is \(p^{2} \triangle p \bigcirc\). By comparing \(p^{2} - 3p - 10\) to \(p^{2} \triangle p \bigcirc\), it's clear that \(\triangle = -3\) (coefficient of \(p\)) and \(\bigcirc = -10\) (constant term).

## 3: Analyze potential misconceptions and difficulties
A common misconception in algebra is handling the signs correctly during expansion, especially with negative numbers. However, in this case, the question does not directly test the distribution of negative signs in multiplication (which can be tricky) but rather focuses on the outcome of the expansion. Students are expected to expand \((p-5)(p+2)\) correctly to \(p^{2} - 3p - 10\).

## 4: Consider the abilities and likely responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the algebraic expansion, potentially missing the \(-10\) or incorrectly calculating the coefficient of \(p\). They might not accurately compare coefficients and constant terms. Expect a high chance of error, with \(C = 40\%\) (correct answer), \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 20\%\), and \(D = 20\%\).
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They should be able to expand and simplify but might confuse \(\triangle\) and \(\bigcirc\). Expect \(C = 60\%\), with some students confusing \(-3\) and \(-10\), so \(B = 20\%\), \(A = 10\%\), and \(D = 10\%\).
- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations. They should easily identify \(\bigcirc = -10\), so \(C = 80\%\), with \(B = 15\%\), \(A = 3\%\), and \(D = 2\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are very confident in their algebraic skills. They would quickly and accurately determine \(\bigcirc = -10\), leading to \(C = 95\%\), with small chances of errors, so \(B = 4\%\), \(A = 1\%\), and \(D = 0\%\).

## 5: Translate analysis into predicted percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
- **Basic:** A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
- **Proficient:** A=3% B=15% C=80% D=2%
- **Advanced:** A=1% B=4% C=95% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=3% B=15% C=80% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=95% D=0%
