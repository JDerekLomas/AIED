## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks about the relationship between two angles that form a complete rotation around a point, implying they are supplementary to a full circle.

## 2: Identifying Key Concepts
The key concept here is that angles around a point add up to \(360^\circ\). This is a fundamental property of geometry that students learn early on.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be that the angles add up to \(180^\circ\), which is true for angles on a straight line but not around a point. Another misconception might involve thinking the angles are equal or parallel, which doesn't apply to the relationship between angles around a point.

## 4: Assessing Difficulty by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric concepts. They might confuse this with angles on a straight line (\(180^\circ\)) or think angles are equal because they look equal in the diagram.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic geometry. They should know angles on a line add to \(180^\circ\) and around a point to \(360^\circ\), but might still make simple errors.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid understanding of geometry and should easily recognize that angles around a point add to \(360^\circ\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can apply and extend geometric concepts. They will certainly know the correct relationship.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
Given the question's straightforward nature and the fact that it directly tests a fundamental concept:
- **Below Basic**: Might choose \(A=20\%\) (thinking they are equal), \(B=10\%\) (misunderstanding "parallel" in this context), \(C=40\%\) (thinking they add to \(180^\circ\)), \(D=30\%\) (correct but by chance or partial understanding).
- **Basic**: Would likely choose \(A=10\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=25\%\), \(D=60\%\), as they have a better grasp but might still confuse with \(180^\circ\).
- **Proficient**: Should mostly choose \(D\), with \(A=5\%\), \(B=2\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=83\%\).
- **Advanced**: Would almost certainly choose \(D\), with minimal errors: \(A=1\%\), \(B=1\%\), \(C=2\%\), \(D=96\%\).

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Based on typical student performance and understanding:
- **Below Basic**: \(A=25\%\), \(B=15\%\), \(C=45\%\), \(D=15\%\)
- **Basic**: \(A=10\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=30\%\), \(D=55\%\)
- **Proficient**: \(A=5\%\), \(B=2\%\), \(C=15\%\), \(D=78\%\)
- **Advanced**: \(A=1\%\), \(B=1\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=93\%\)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=30% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=15% D=78%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=5% D=93%
