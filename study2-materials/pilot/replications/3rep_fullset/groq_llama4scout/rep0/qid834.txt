## Step 1: Understand the question
The question requires students to factorize the quadratic expression \(x^{2}+12x+32\) and determine what will appear in the box to complete the factorization in the form \((x+4) \square\).

## 2: Factorize the quadratic expression
To factorize \(x^{2}+12x+32\), we need to find two numbers that multiply to 32 and add to 12. These numbers are 8 and 4 because \(8 \times 4 = 32\) and \(8 + 4 = 12\). So, \(x^{2}+12x+32 = (x+8)(x+4)\).

## 3: Identify the correct completion of the factorization
Given that the expression factorizes to \((x+8)(x+4)\), the correct completion of \((x+4) \square\) is \((x+8)\).

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception might involve incorrectly identifying the factors or misinterpreting the form of the factorization. However, this question is relatively straightforward because it directly tests the ability to factor a quadratic expression and then apply that factorization to complete a given form.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and factorizations. They might not correctly factor \(x^{2}+12x+32\) or might mistakenly try to force factors that don't fit. Given the simplicity of the factors (8 and 4), some might guess or incorrectly calculate, leading to a higher chance of selecting incorrect options like A, B, or D.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (guessing or mistaken factors), B=20% (possibly thinking of larger factors incorrectly), C=40% (correct, but struggling), D=10% (mistaken sign or factor).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%. Students here should mostly get it right but might have a small chance of error.
- **Proficient**: A=2%, B=1%, C=96%, D=1%. These students are expected to consistently factorize correctly.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=99%, D=1%. Advanced students should have no trouble with this.

## 7: Adjust estimates based on realistic student performance
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
- **Basic**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
proficient: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%
