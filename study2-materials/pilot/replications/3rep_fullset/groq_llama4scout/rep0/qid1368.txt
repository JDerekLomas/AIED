## Step 1: Understand the question
The question presents a graph and asks for the value of \( x \) when \( y=1 \). The graph appears to be a curved U-shaped graph, passing through the points \( (-2, 1) \), \( (0,0) \), \( (2,1) \), and \( (4,4) \). We need to find \( x \) when \( y=1 \).

## 2: Identify the relevant points on the graph
From the given points, when \( y=1 \), \( x \) can be either \( -2 \) or \( 2 \). These are the points \( (-2, 1) \) and \( (2,1) \) on the graph.

## 3: Analyze the answer choices
- A: \( x=1.3 \)
- B: \( x=2 \)
- C: \( \begin{array}{c}x=-1.3 \\ \text { and } x=1.3\end{array} \)
- D: \( \begin{array}{c}x=-2 \\ \text { and } x=2\end{array} \)

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and student understanding
Students might misinterpret the graph or not accurately read the points. However, given that two clear points are provided where \( y=1 \), students should be able to identify \( x=-2 \) and \( x=2 \) as solutions.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to read the graph or understand the question. They might not identify the correct points or might choose an option that seems plausible but is incorrect. Option D seems directly supported by the graph, but some might choose B if they only see one solution or A/C if they misread the graph. **A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%**
- **Basic**: Students here have a better understanding but might still make simple errors. They should recognize the points \( (-2, 1) \) and \( (2,1) \), making D a strong choice. **A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%**
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to accurately read the graph and solve the problem. They should easily identify \( x=-2 \) and \( x=2 \) as solutions. **A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%**
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will have a strong grasp of the concepts and should not make errors in reading the graph or solving for \( x \). **A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%**

## 6: Provide the final predictions
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
