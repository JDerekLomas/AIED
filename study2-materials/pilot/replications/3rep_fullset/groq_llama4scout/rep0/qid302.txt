## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to simplify the given algebraic fraction: \(\frac{(x+3)(x+5)}{(x+3)(x+10)}\). The correct simplification involves cancelling out the common factor \((x+3)\) from the numerator and the denominator, leading to \(\frac{x+5}{x+10}\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception in algebra is the incorrect cancellation of terms or failure to recognize that a term can be cancelled out only if it appears in both the numerator and the denominator. Another potential error is not simplifying the expression at all.

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \(\frac{x+1}{x+2}\), does not result from the correct simplification of the given expression. It seems to be a random or incorrectly simplified form.

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \(\frac{x+5}{x+10}\), is the correct simplification of the given expression after cancelling \((x+3)\) from both the numerator and the denominator.

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \(\frac{x^{2}+8x+15}{x^{2}+13x+30}\), represents the original expression before simplification. Students might choose this if they do not recognize that \((x+3)(x+5) = x^2 + 8x + 15\) and \((x+3)(x+10) = x^2 + 13x + 30\), or if they are unable to simplify the fraction.

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \(\frac{1}{2}\), does not relate to the algebraic simplification of the given expression. It seems to be an unrelated or incorrect option.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand algebraic simplification or might incorrectly simplify. They are likely to choose options that do not involve correct algebraic manipulation, such as A or D, due to a lack of understanding. Option C might also be chosen as it reflects a literal reading of the expression without attempting simplification. \(A=20\%\), \(B=30\%\), \(C=40\%\), \(D=10\%\).

- **Basic:** Basic level students might understand the concept of simplification but could struggle with applying it correctly. They are more likely to choose B if they grasp the cancellation concept, but some might stick with C if they're unsure. \(A=10\%\), \(B=60\%\), \(C=25\%\), \(D=5\%\).

- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to correctly simplify the expression. Therefore, they should predominantly choose B. \(A=5\%\), \(B=85\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=5\%\).

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to have a deep understanding of algebraic manipulations and should easily identify B as the correct answer. \(A=0\%\), \(B=95\%\), \(C=0\%\), \(D=5\%\).

## 8: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
- basic: A=10% B=60% C=25% D=5%
- proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
