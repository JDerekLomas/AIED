To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of writing \( 0.909 \) as a percentage, let's analyze the potential difficulties and misconceptions.

The task involves converting a decimal to a percentage. The correct conversion involves multiplying by 100. So, \( 0.909 \times 100 = 90.9\% \).

- **Misconceptions and Errors:**
  - A common misconception might involve incorrect placement of the decimal point or misunderstanding the conversion factor (e.g., multiplying or dividing by 10 or 1000 instead of 100).
  - Option A (\( 99 \% \)) could be chosen by students who mistakenly round or miscalculate.
  - Option B (\( 909 \% \)) might be selected by students who incorrectly multiply \( 0.909 \) by 1000 instead of 100.
  - Option D (\( 9.9 \% \)) could be chosen by students who divide \( 0.909 \) by 10 instead of multiplying by 100.

Given these potential errors and the simplicity of the correct calculation, let's estimate the performance across different ability levels:

### Below Basic
- Students at this level may struggle with basic conversions and are more likely to make significant errors.
- **A (\( 99 \% \)):** 20% (miscalculation or incorrect rounding)
- **B (\( 909 \% \)):** 30% (multiplying by 1000)
- **C (\( 90.9 \% \)):** 20% (correct, but might be due to luck)
- **D (\( 9.9 \% \)):** 30% (dividing by 10)

### Basic
- Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make simple errors.
- **A (\( 99 \% \)):** 10% (rounding error)
- **B (\( 909 \% \)):** 20% (incorrect multiplication)
- **C (\( 90.9 \% \)):** 60% (correct conversion)
- **D (\( 9.9 \% \)):** 10% (simple division error)

### Proficient
- These students understand the concept and can apply it correctly most of the time.
- **A (\( 99 \% \)):** 2% (minor calculation mistake)
- **B (\( 909 \% \)):** 5% (error in multiplication by 100)
- **C (\( 90.9 \% \)):** 90% (correct conversion)
- **D (\( 9.9 \% \)):** 3% (rare division mistake)

### Advanced
- Students at this level can apply their knowledge accurately and handle more complex problems.
- **A (\( 99 \% \)):** 0% (rarely make such mistakes)
- **B (\( 909 \% \)):** 1% (unlikely multiplication error)
- **C (\( 90.9 \% \)):** 98% (accurately convert)
- **D (\( 9.9 \% \)):** 1% (very rare error)

So, the predictions in the requested format are:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=98% D=1%
