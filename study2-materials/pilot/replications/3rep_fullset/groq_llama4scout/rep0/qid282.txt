To approach this question, let's consider the properties of a rhombus and what the question is testing. A rhombus is a special type of quadrilateral where all four sides are of equal length. One of the key properties of a rhombus is that its diagonals bisect each other at right angles (are perpendicular), but this does not necessarily mean that its sides are perpendicular to each other.

The question asks which lines must be perpendicular in a rhombus \( ABCD \). Let's evaluate each option:

A: \( AB \) and \( BC \) - These are adjacent sides of the rhombus, and while they are equal in length, they are not necessarily perpendicular.

B: \( AC \) and \( DB \) - These are the diagonals of the rhombus. A well-known property of a rhombus is that its diagonals are perpendicular.

C: \( AB \) and \( DC \) - These are opposite sides of the rhombus. Opposite sides of a rhombus are parallel, not perpendicular.

D: None of them - This option suggests that none of the pairs listed must be perpendicular.

Given these properties:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not recall properties of a rhombus or might confuse it with other shapes. They might incorrectly think that adjacent sides are perpendicular (a property of a square, not all rhombi) or not understand the concept of diagonals. So, they might choose A or C (thinking adjacent or opposite sides are perpendicular), or D (not understanding any property).
  - A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of shapes but might not recall specific properties of a rhombus. They might remember that diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other but not necessarily that they are perpendicular.
  - A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%

- **Proficient**: Students at this level are likely to know that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular. They might still struggle with the sides being parallel or equal but understand the key properties.
  - A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%

- **Advanced**: Students at this advanced level are very confident in their understanding of geometric properties. They not only know that the diagonals are perpendicular but also understand the implications of this property.
  - A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

So, considering the above analysis:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
