To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question requires students to divide the total cost of eight bottles of water (£3.60) by 8 to find the cost of one bottle. This is a straightforward division problem.

## Step 1: Calculate the correct answer
To find the cost of one bottle of water, we divide £3.60 by 8.
£3.60 ÷ 8 = £0.45

## 2: Convert the correct answer into a more understandable format
£0.45 is equivalent to 45p.

## 3: Analyze the options given
- A: £28.80 (This would be 8 times £3.60, not a plausible mistake for division)
- B: 30p (Less than the correct answer, could be a mistake if the student incorrectly divides or rounds)
- C: 45p (The correct answer)
- D: £3.53 (Very close to £3.60, could be a mistake if subtracting a small amount instead of dividing)

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and difficulties
- Students might struggle with dividing by 8 or converting between pounds and pence.
- A common error could be multiplying instead of dividing (leading to option A), or getting close but incorrect values (like option D).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand division or might confuse operations. They could choose A (thinking multiplication is correct) or D (for a subtraction-like error).
- **Basic:** These students should understand basic division but might make calculation errors. They are likely to choose C but could opt for B if they miscalculate.
- **Proficient:** Students here should accurately divide £3.60 by 8. They are likely to choose C, with a small chance of B if they make a minor calculation mistake.
- **Advanced:** These students are highly likely to choose C as they are confident in their division skills.

## 6: Assign percentages
Given the nature of the question and the options:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (for multiplication error), B=20% (random guess), C=20% (might get it right by chance), D=20% (close but wrong).
- **Basic:** A=10% (unlikely but possible mistake), B=15% (possible calculation error), C=70% (correct calculation), D=5% (small chance of close but incorrect).
- **Proficient:** A=2% (very unlikely), B=5% (minor calculation mistake), C=92% (accurate calculation), D=1% (extremely unlikely).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no chance), B=1% (unlikely), C=98% (almost certain), D=1% (very unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=92% D=1%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=98% D=1%
