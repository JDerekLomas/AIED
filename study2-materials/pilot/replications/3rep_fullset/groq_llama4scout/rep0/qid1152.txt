To approach this, let's first analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie regarding the order of operations, and then predict the performance of students at different ability levels.

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Statement
Tom says: \( 6+4-2 \equiv 4-2+6 \). Let's evaluate both expressions:
- Left side: \( 6 + 4 - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \)
- Right side: \( 4 - 2 + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8 \)
So, Tom's statement is correct because both sides equal 8.

## 2: Analyze Katie's Statement
Katie says: \( 6+4 \times 2 \equiv 6 \times 4+2 \). Let's evaluate both expressions following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right):
- Left side: \( 6 + 4 \times 2 = 6 + 8 = 14 \)
- Right side: \( 6 \times 4 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \)
So, Katie's statement is incorrect because the left side equals 14 and the right side equals 26.

## 3: Evaluating Student Performance
Given the analysis, Tom is correct, and Katie is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Only Tom.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might not correctly evaluate the expressions or might misunderstand the statements. Given the simplicity of Tom's example, they might be more likely to agree with Tom but could also struggle with Katie's, potentially leading to a higher percentage of D (Neither is correct) or B (Only Katie) due to confusion. However, without strong foundational knowledge, they might not accurately assess either statement.
  - A=40% (some recognize Tom's correctness), B=20% (misunderstanding Katie), C=10% (unlikely to understand both), D=30% (completely unsure or incorrect).

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of operations but might still make mistakes with order of operations. They are more likely to correctly evaluate Tom's statement but might struggle with Katie's due to not applying the rules correctly.
  - A=60% (recognize Tom's correctness), B=20% (mistakenly think Katie is correct), C=10% (don't realize Katie is wrong), D=10% (completely incorrect).

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of the order of operations. They should easily see Tom's statement as correct and Katie's as incorrect.
  - A=80% (easily see Tom is correct, Katie is not), B=5% (unlikely to mistakenly support Katie), C=5% (unlikely to think both are correct), D=10% (very few would think neither is correct).

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the order of operations but can also apply it in complex situations. They would quickly and accurately assess both statements.
  - A=90% (clearly understand Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness), B=0% (unlikely to mistakenly think Katie is correct), C=0% (know both statements accurately), D=10% (extremely few would disagree).

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
