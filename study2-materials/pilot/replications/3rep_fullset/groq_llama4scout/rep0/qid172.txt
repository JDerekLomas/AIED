## Step 1: Understand the sequence and its nth-term rule
The given nth-term rule of the sequence is \(5n - 7\). To find the first term, we substitute \(n = 1\) into the rule.

## 2: Calculate the first term
Substituting \(n = 1\) into \(5n - 7\), we get \(5(1) - 7 = 5 - 7 = -2\).

## 3: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer is \(A = -2\), as calculated.

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception could be substituting \(n = 0\) instead of \(n = 1\) for the first term, which would yield \(5(0) - 7 = -7\), corresponding to option \(C\). Another error could be misunderstanding the sequence rule, but given the simplicity of this rule, such errors are less likely.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand sequence rules or might incorrectly substitute \(n = 0\) or another value. They might choose \(C = -7\) (substituting \(n = 0\)) or randomly select an option. Let's assume \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 60\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic sequence concepts but might still make simple errors. They are likely to understand substituting \(n = 1\) but might be tempted by \(C = -7\) if they consider \(n = 0\). Let's assume \(A = 70\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Proficient:** These students are expected to confidently and accurately apply sequence rules. The correct answer \(A = -2\) should be chosen by most, with minimal errors. Let's assume \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 2\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 3\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply sequence rules without errors. The correct answer should be almost universally chosen. Let's assume \(A = 98\%\), \(B = 1\%\), \(C = 1\%\), \(D = 0\%\).

## 6: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=2% C=5% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=2% C=5% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
