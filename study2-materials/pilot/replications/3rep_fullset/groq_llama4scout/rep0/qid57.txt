## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question presents a right-angled triangle with an angle of 52 degrees, the side opposite to this angle is 6cm, and the side next to this angle is \( p \). The task is to determine which trigonometric ratio would be used to find the value of \( p \).

## 2: Recall Trigonometric Ratios
The three basic trigonometric ratios in a right-angled triangle are:
- Sine (Sin) = opposite side / hypotenuse
- Cosine (Cos) = adjacent side / hypotenuse
- Tangent (Tan) = opposite side / adjacent side

## 3: Identify Given and Required Information
Given: angle = 52 degrees, opposite side = 6cm, adjacent side = \( p \), and we need to find \( p \).

## 4: Determine the Appropriate Trigonometric Ratio
To find \( p \) (the adjacent side), and given the opposite side and the angle, the most direct ratio involving \( p \) and the given information is:
\[ \tan(52^\circ) = \frac{6}{p} \]
Rearranging for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{6}{\tan(52^\circ)} \]
This implies using the tangent ratio to solve for \( p \), but in a form that involves \( \tan \) and then rearranging. However, a more straightforward approach to directly find \( p \) using basic trigonometric ratios would be:
\[ \cos(52^\circ) = \frac{p}{\text{hypotenuse}} \]
or
\[ \tan(52^\circ) = \frac{6}{p} \]
But to directly solve for \( p \) with given information (angle and opposite side), one would typically use:
\[ p = 6 \cdot \cot(52^\circ) \] or directly use \( \tan(52^\circ) = \frac{6}{p} \) which rearranges to \( p = \frac{6}{\tan(52^\circ)} \). The direct and simple choice for finding \( p \) given the opposite side and angle is actually using \( \tan \) because \( \tan = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \), thus:
\[ \tan(52^\circ) = \frac{6}{p} \]
So, \( p = \frac{6}{\tan(52^\circ)} \), which means we are looking for \( \tan \) to relate \( p \) and the given side.

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to recall trigonometric ratios or apply them correctly. They might confuse the ratios or not recognize how to apply them to find \( p \). Given the simplicity of the ratios, some might incorrectly choose \( \sin \) or \( \cos \) without properly considering the sides given. \( A = 30\% \), \( B = 40\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 10\% \)
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still struggle with applying the ratios to the given scenario. They are more likely to recognize \( \tan \) as relevant because it directly involves the opposite and adjacent sides. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 45\% \), \( D = 5\% \)
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand and correctly apply trigonometric ratios. They should easily identify \( \tan \) as the correct ratio since \( \tan = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \). \( A = 10\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 65\% \), \( D = 5\% \)
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will not only correctly identify \( \tan \) but also might see the question as straightforward. They are highly likely to choose \( \tan \) correctly. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 80\% \), \( D = 5\% \)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=20% C=65% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
