To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "What is \( 8 \) out of \( 40 \) as a percentage?", let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions.

The question requires students to convert a fraction into a percentage. The fraction given is \( \frac{8}{40} \), which can be simplified to \( \frac{1}{5} \) or \( 0.2 \). To convert \( 0.2 \) into a percentage, students need to multiply by \( 100 \), resulting in \( 20\% \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question seems straightforward, testing the ability to convert a fraction to a percentage. However, the potential for error exists if students are not confident in their calculation or if they misunderstand the concept of percentages.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect calculation or forgetting to multiply by \( 100 \) to convert to a percentage. Another could be misinterpreting the fraction \( \frac{8}{40} \) or making a calculation error.

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( 8.4\% \). This could result from a miscalculation, such as \( \frac{8}{40} = 0.2 \) but then incorrectly converting it or adding an extra step that goes wrong.

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( 20\% \), which is the correct answer. This requires accurate calculation: \( \frac{8}{40} = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \).

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( 16\% \). This could arise from a calculation error, such as \( 8 \div 40 = 0.2 \) but then \( 0.2 \times 100 = 20 \), not \( 16 \), suggesting a possible confusion or error in calculation.

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \( 24\% \). This seems to come from a more significant calculation error, possibly multiplying \( 8 \) by \( 100 \) and then dividing by \( 40 \) or another incorrect operation.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic calculations. They could easily choose A, C, or D due to calculation errors. Let's assume \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 40\% \) (some might get it right by chance or simple division), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 20\% \).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make calculation errors. They are more likely to get it right but could choose A or C. Let's assume \( A = 10\% \), \( B = 70\% \), \( C = 15\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make errors. Let's assume \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 90\% \), \( C = 4\% \), \( D = 1\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident and accurate. Let's assume \( A = 2\% \), \( B = 95\% \), \( C = 2\% \), \( D = 1\% \).

## 8: Final Predictions
Given the analysis, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
