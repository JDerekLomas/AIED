To approach this question, let's first understand the concept being tested: reflection of a point across the line \(y = -x\). When a point \((x, y)\) is reflected across the line \(y = -x\), its new coordinates become \((-y, -x)\). 

Given point \(Q\) has coordinates \((-3, 3)\), applying the reflection across \(y = -x\), the new coordinates would be \((-3, -(-3)) = (-3, 3)\). 

However, let's correct that with the proper formula: for a point \((x, y)\), its reflection across \(y = -x\) is \((-y, -x)\). So, for \((-3, 3)\), we get \((-3, -(-3))\) which simplifies to \((-3, 3)\).

The correct calculation directly applying the transformation rule: 
- The original point is \((-3, 3)\).
- The reflection of \((x, y)\) in \(y = -x\) is \((-y, -x)\).
- So, for \((-3, 3)\), the reflection is \((-3, -(-3)) = (-3, 3)\).

This matches option C, suggesting that students who understand the concept should choose C.

Let's predict the student responses based on ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand coordinate geometry or reflections. They might mistakenly think reflecting across \(y=-x\) means changing the signs of both \(x\) and \(y\) (which would be correct for reflecting across the origin, not \(y=-x\)), or they might not apply any transformation. 
  - A: \( (3,3) \): 20% (misinterpretation or random guess)
  - B: \( (-3,-3) \): 20% (incorrect reflection, perhaps thinking of a different line or operation)
  - C: \( (-3,3) \): 40% (not applying transformation or understanding it results in the same point)
  - D: \( (3,-3) \): 20% (might think this is a form of reflection but not applying it correctly)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might struggle with nuanced concepts.
  - A: \( (3,3) \): 10%
  - B: \( (-3,-3) \): 10%
  - C: \( (-3,3) \): 60% (starting to understand or familiar with reflecting across \(y=-x\))
  - D: \( (3,-3) \): 20%

- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with coordinate geometry and should understand reflections.
  - A: \( (3,3) \): 5%
  - B: \( (-3,-3) \): 5%
  - C: \( (-3,3) \): 80% (accurately applying reflection)
  - D: \( (3,-3) \): 10%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident and should rarely make errors.
  - A: \( (3,3) \): 0%
  - B: \( (-3,-3) \): 0%
  - C: \( (-3,3) \): 95%
  - D: \( (3,-3) \): 5%

Therefore, the prediction is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
