To solve this, let's first convert all the given fractions and decimals into a comparable format, such as decimals, to identify the outlier.

## Step 1: Convert fractions to decimals
- \( \frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \)
- \( \frac{41}{50} = 0.82 \)
- \( \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \)
- \( 0.77 \) is already in decimal form.
- \( \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \)
- \( \frac{79}{100} = 0.79 \)

## 2: Arrange the values in order
- \( 0.35, 0.77, 0.79, 0.8, 0.8, 0.82 \)

## 3: Identify the outlier
The values cluster around 0.8, with 0.77, 0.79, 0.8, 0.8, and 0.82 being close. The outlier here is \( 0.35 \) because it's significantly lower than the others. However, we need to match this to the given options:
- \( \frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \)
- \( \frac{41}{50} = 0.82 \)
- \( \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \)
- \( 0.77 \) remains 0.77
- \( \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \)
- \( \frac{79}{100} = 0.79 \)

## 4: Match the outlier to the given options
The outlier in decimal form is \( 0.35 \), which corresponds to \( \frac{7}{20} \).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with conversions and comparisons. They might not accurately convert fractions to decimals or might not understand what an outlier is. However, the question does not require complex calculations but rather observation. Given that \( \frac{7}{20} \) is clearly different when converted, but the concept of an outlier might be tricky, let's assume:
  - A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- **Basic:** Students here should have a better grasp of fractions and decimals. They might still struggle with the concept of an outlier but should be able to see \( \frac{7}{20} \) is different.
  - A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
- **Proficient:** These students should easily convert fractions to decimals and understand the concept of an outlier. They should quickly identify \( \frac{7}{20} \) as the outlier.
  - A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the concepts but can also reason about the data set efficiently. They should have no trouble identifying \( \frac{7}{20} \) as the outlier.
  - A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%

The best answer is B. 

below_basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
