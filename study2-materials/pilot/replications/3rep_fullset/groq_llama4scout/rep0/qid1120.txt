To approach this question, let's first understand the common misconceptions and errors students might make when multiplying out brackets, and then consider how the specific question \( m(2 m-7) \) might be affected by these.

## Step 1: Identifying Common Misconceptions
A common misconception when expanding brackets involves incorrectly applying the distributive property or not applying it at all. For the expression \( m(2m - 7) \), students are expected to multiply \( m \) by each term inside the brackets: \( m \times 2m \) and \( m \times -7 \), yielding \( 2m^2 - 7m \).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 3m - 7 \) suggests a failure to understand the distributive property and possibly adding the terms inside the brackets before multiplying by \( m \).
- Option B: \( 2m^2 - 7 \) suggests that the student forgot to multiply \( m \) by \( -7 \) or incorrectly handled the multiplication.
- Option C: \( 3m - 7m \) suggests a misunderstanding of the algebraic manipulation or a mistake in applying the distributive property.
- Option D: \( 2m^2 - 7m \) is the correct expansion.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might not fully grasp the concept of expanding brackets. They are likely to make significant errors. Option A (\( 3m - 7 \)) could be a result of incorrect application of operations. Option B (\( 2m^2 - 7 \)) might result from not fully applying the distributive property. Option C (\( 3m - 7m \)) seems unlikely as it doesn't directly result from a simple mistake in expansion. Option D (\( 2m^2 - 7m \)) is unlikely to be chosen by many.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still make errors. They might choose Option B or A due to simple mistakes in calculation or misunderstanding the distributive property. Option D is more likely to be chosen here than in the below basic group but still, errors are common.
- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of algebra and are less likely to make errors in simple expansions like this. The correct answer, \( 2m^2 - 7m \), should be chosen by a high percentage, with fewer opting for incorrect options.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly competent and would almost certainly choose the correct option, \( 2m^2 - 7m \).

## 4: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (simple addition error), B=30% (forgot to multiply by -7), C=10% (random or specific mistake), D=40% (some understanding but not fully applied).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=20%, C=5%, D=65% (most understand the concept but still a few errors).
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=5%, C=2%, D=88% (strong understanding, few errors).
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (excellent understanding, no errors).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=5% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=2% D=88%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
