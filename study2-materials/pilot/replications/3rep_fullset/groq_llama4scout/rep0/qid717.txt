To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions.

The expression given is \( p^{2} - 100 \). This is a difference of squares, which can be factorized into \( (p - 10)(p + 10) \). The correct answer is C) \( (p-10)(p+10) \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception for students might be to think that \( p^{2} - 100 \) can be factorized in a way that doesn't recognize it as a difference of squares. For example, students might try to factor it like a quadratic equation or think it doesn't factorize if they're not familiar with the difference of squares formula.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \( p(p-10) \), suggests a factorization that would be incorrect for \( p^{2} - 100 \) but could be a plausible mistake if students are trying to factor out a common factor incorrectly or applying a wrong factorization technique.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( (p-10)(p-10) \), implies \( p^{2} - 100 = (p-10)^{2} \), which is not true since \( (p-10)^{2} = p^{2} - 20p + 100 \).

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D, "Does not factorise," might attract students who are not confident in their ability to factorize the expression or those who do not recognize \( p^{2} - 100 \) as a difference of squares.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle to recognize the difference of squares. They might choose A because it seems like a simple factorization or D because they don't know how to proceed. B might seem plausible if they mistakenly think it's a perfect square. C would be challenging for them to derive. So, below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of algebra but might not readily recognize the formula. They might still fall for A or B due to lack of practice or recognition of the formula. C should start to become more recognizable. So, basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students should easily recognize \( p^{2} - 100 \) as a difference of squares and choose C. Mistakes might still happen but are less likely. So, proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to not only recognize the difference of squares but also to apply it confidently. The correct answer, C, should be chosen by nearly all. So, advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
