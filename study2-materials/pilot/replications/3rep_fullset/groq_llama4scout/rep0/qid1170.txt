To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls or clarity in the formulas provided.

The question presents a right-angled triangle with sides labeled as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), where \(a\) is the height, \(b\) is the base, and \(c\) is the hypotenuse. The task is to choose the correct formula for finding side \(a\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\(c\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\(a\) and \(b\)). This can be expressed as \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\). 

## 2: Manipulating the Pythagorean Theorem for Side \(a\)
To find side \(a\), we rearrange the formula: \(a^2 = c^2 - b^2\). This matches option D.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(a = c - b\). This is incorrect because it suggests a linear relationship between the sides, which does not apply in a right-angled triangle.
- Option B: \(a^2 = b^2 + c^2\). This is incorrect because it incorrectly states that \(a\) is the hypotenuse.
- Option C: \(a^2 = b^2 - c^2\). This would be incorrect because it implies \(c^2\) is being subtracted from \(b^2\), which does not align with the Pythagorean theorem when solving for \(a\).
- Option D: \(a^2 = c^2 - b^2\). This is correct as per the rearranged Pythagorean theorem.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the Pythagorean theorem or how to apply it. They might be tempted by simple or intuitive but incorrect formulas. Option A (\(a=c-b\)) seems like a simple subtraction and might appeal to some, but given the context, most might struggle to identify the correct formula. 
  - A: 30% (simple but wrong), B: 20% (misapplication), C: 15% (another wrong formula), D: 35% (correct, through luck or basic understanding).

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes or not fully apply the theorem correctly.
  - A: 15%, B: 10%, C: 10%, D: 65%.

- **Proficient:** These students understand the Pythagorean theorem well and can apply it. Mistakes are less likely but could occur due to carelessness.
  - A: 5%, B: 5%, C: 5%, D: 85%.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the theorem but can also manipulate it and apply it in various contexts. They are less likely to make mistakes.
  - A: 0%, B: 0%, C: 0%, D: 100%.

## 5: Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=15% D=35%
- **basic:** A=15% B=10% C=10% D=65%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=10% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
