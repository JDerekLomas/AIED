## Step 1: Understand the question and the content it tests
The question requires students to factorise the expression \(18a - 12\) fully. This involves finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms \(18a\) and \(12\), and then expressing the expression as a product of this GCF and the resulting terms.

## 2: Identify the GCF of \(18a\) and \(12\)
The factors of \(18a\) are \(1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, a, 2a, 3a, 6a, 9a, 18a\), and the factors of \(12\) are \(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\). The greatest common factor among these, considering \(a\) as a variable, is \(6\).

## 3: Factorise \(18a - 12\) using the GCF
Dividing each term by \(6\), we get \(18a / 6 = 3a\) and \(12 / 6 = 2\). So, \(18a - 12 = 6(3a - 2)\).

## 4: Analyze the answer choices for common misconceptions
- A: \(2(9a - 6)\) is incorrect because \(2\) is not the GCF of \(18a\) and \(12\), and it doesn't factorise fully.
- B: \(18(a - 6/18)\) or \(18(a - 1/3)\) is not directly listed, but \(18(a - 6)\) would imply an incorrect factorisation.
- C: \(6(3a - 2)\) matches our correct factorisation.
- D: \(9(2a - 1)\) is also a correct factorisation since \(9\) is a common factor of \(18a\) and \(12\) (\(18 = 9 \times 2\) and \(12 = 9 \times 4/3\), but directly \(9 \times (2a - 4/3)\) doesn't fit; however, calculating: \(9(2a - 4/3) = 18a - 12\), which actually works).

## 5: Consider student errors and understanding
Students might struggle with finding the greatest common factor, especially if they are not confident in their multiplication tables or factor knowledge. The common error could be factoring out a number that is not the greatest common factor or incorrectly dividing terms.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: At this level, students might not fully understand factorisation or finding GCF. They might choose A or B due to not fully simplifying or understanding the concept. C would be correct but might be less likely chosen if they struggle with GCF. D might seem plausible but requires a good understanding of factors. Prediction: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might make simple errors. They are more likely to get C but could be tempted by A or D. B seems less likely as it doesn't factor out the highest common factor correctly. Prediction: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand factorisation well and are likely to choose C or D, as both are correct factorisations. The error rate for choosing A or B should be low. Prediction: A=5% B=5% C=45% D=45%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident and accurate. They should easily identify C and D as correct, with a very low likelihood of choosing A or B. Prediction: A=0% B=0% C=50% D=50%.

## 7: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
- basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=45% D=45%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=50% D=50%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=45% D=45%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=50% D=50%
