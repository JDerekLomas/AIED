To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential difficulties students might face, considering various ability levels: below_basic, basic, proficient, and advanced.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to identify which image completes a symmetric figure on a Geo board, given a figure drawn in one half of a box and a red dotted line running diagonally across the box. Symmetry in this context means that the missing part must be a mirror image of the given figure across the diagonal line.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception among students when dealing with symmetry, especially diagonal symmetry, is not properly accounting for the reflective properties across the line of symmetry. This can lead to incorrect reflections.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A, B, C, and D provide different possible completions of the figure. Only one correctly reflects the given figure across the diagonal line.

## 4: Considering Student Ability Levels
- **Below_Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic concepts of geometry and symmetry. They may not fully understand what a symmetric figure is or how to reflect a shape across a line, especially a diagonal one. Given the visual nature of the question, they might guess or choose an option that looks "right" to them, but their understanding of symmetry is likely limited. **A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%**
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of geometric shapes and might have been introduced to basic symmetry concepts. However, they might still struggle with applying these concepts to less straightforward problems, like diagonal symmetry on a Geo board. They are more likely to choose the correct option than those below_basic but might still be fooled by visually appealing incorrect options. **A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%**
- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid grasp of geometric concepts, including symmetry. They should be able to accurately reflect the given figure across the diagonal line and thus choose the correct option. Their performance will likely be high on this question. **A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%**
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand symmetry but may also have a deeper understanding of geometric transformations. They are likely to perform very well on this question, with a high percentage choosing the correct option. **A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%**

## 5: Conclusion
Given the analysis, the predicted percentages for each ability level are as follows:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
