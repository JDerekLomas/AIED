To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( (-3)-5= \), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with it.

The question requires the student to subtract 5 from -3, which involves understanding of negative numbers and the rules for subtraction. A common misconception when dealing with negative numbers is misunderstanding the effect of subtracting a positive number from a negative number.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A frequent mistake is to think that subtracting a number always results in a smaller number, which can lead to confusion when dealing with negative numbers. For example, students might mistakenly think that \( (-3) - 5 \) could result in a positive number or might not correctly apply the rule that subtracting a positive number is the same as adding a negative number.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 2 \) suggests an incorrect addition or misunderstanding of negative numbers.
- Option B: \( -2 \) seems plausible but is incorrect because \( -3 - 5 = -8 \).
- Option C: \( 8 \) implies a significant misunderstanding, possibly adding the numbers without considering their signs.
- Option D: \( -8 \) is the correct answer, as \( -3 - 5 = -8 \).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students struggle with basic arithmetic and understanding of negative numbers. They are likely to make significant errors. Option A (\( 2 \)) and Option C (\( 8 \)) might appeal due to incorrect calculations or misunderstanding of negative numbers. \( A = 30\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 30\% \), \( D = 20\% \).
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with applying rules consistently. They might incorrectly calculate or forget to apply the correct sign. \( A = 15\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 15\% \), \( D = 40\% \).
- **Proficient:** These students understand the basic operations with negative numbers but might still make occasional errors under pressure. The correct answer, \( -8 \), should be more frequently chosen. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 80\% \).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of negative numbers and operations. They are less likely to make mistakes on simple arithmetic. \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 0\% \), \( D = 95\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
