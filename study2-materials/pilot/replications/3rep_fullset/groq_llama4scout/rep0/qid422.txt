To approach this question, let's first understand what's being asked. The task is to determine the vector that describes how to get from point \( P \) to point \( Q \), given that \( P \) is 4 squares left and 2 squares up from \( Q \). 

The vector from \( P \) to \( Q \) can be found by subtracting the coordinates of \( P \) from \( Q \), or simply by understanding the direction and magnitude of the movement from \( P \) to \( Q \). Since \( P \) is 4 squares to the left and 2 squares up from \( Q \), the vector from \( P \) to \( Q \) is \( \left(\begin{array}{c}4 \\ -2\end{array}\right) \) if we consider right as positive \( x \) direction and down as positive \( y \) direction, but given \( P \) is left and up from \( Q \), it matches \( \left(\begin{array}{c}4 \\ -2\end{array}\right) \) directly without needing coordinate system adjustments.

Let's analyze the options:
- A: \( \left(\begin{array}{l}2 \\ 4\end{array}\right) \) suggests moving 2 units right and 4 units down, which is incorrect.
- B: \( \left(\begin{array}{l}4 \\ 2\end{array}\right) \) suggests moving 4 units right and 2 units up, which is incorrect for the from \( P \) to \( Q \) direction given.
- C: \( \left(\begin{array}{c}4 \\ -2\end{array}\right) \) suggests moving 4 units right and 2 units down, which matches the description if we interpret \( P \) to \( Q \) directly as given.
- D: \( \left(\begin{array}{c}-2 \\ 4\end{array}\right) \) suggests moving 2 units left and 4 units up, which matches the given description of \( P \) being 4 squares left and 2 squares up from \( Q \), implying a vector \( \left(\begin{array}{c}-4 \\ 2\end{array}\right) \) would be the actual correct mathematical representation but let's correct that based on standard interpretation.

Given \( P \) is 4 squares left and 2 squares up from \( Q \), to go from \( P \) to \( Q \), you'd move 4 squares right (not left, so \( +4 \)) and 2 squares down (not up, so \( -2 \)), hence \( \left(\begin{array}{c}4 \\ -2\end{array}\right) \).

## Step 1: Understanding the movement
The movement from \( P \) to \( Q \) is 4 units to the right and 2 units down.

## 2: Identifying the correct vector
The correct vector based on standard coordinate system interpretation (where moving right is positive \( x \) and down is positive \( y \)) is indeed \( \left(\begin{array}{c}4 \\ -2\end{array}\right) \), which corresponds to option C.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding vectors and directions. They might confuse the direction or not fully grasp the concept of vector representation. So, they might choose A, B, or D due to misunderstanding the directions or calculations. A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding but might make simple calculation errors or get confused with the signs. They are more likely to choose C but have a chance of selecting other options due to less confidence. A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
- **Proficient:** Students here are expected to understand vectors well and apply them correctly. They should mostly choose C with a low chance of selecting other options. A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand but can also apply concepts accurately and quickly. The chances of choosing the incorrect options are minimal. A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
