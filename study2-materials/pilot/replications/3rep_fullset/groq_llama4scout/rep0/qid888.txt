## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). This is a standard algebraic task that tests students' understanding of expanding products of binomials.

## 2: Identify the Correct Method
The correct method to expand \((m-5)(m-7)\) involves using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or the distributive property. Applying FOIL:
- First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)
Then, combine like terms: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 3: Analyze Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception when expanding expressions like this is incorrectly applying the signs or not properly combining like terms. For example, some students might forget to distribute the negative sign correctly or might add/subtract the terms incorrectly.

## 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices
- A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\)
- B: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\) (Correct answer)
- C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\)
- D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\)

## 5: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly apply the FOIL method or forget to combine like terms properly.
- A: 30% (incorrect but plausible if they mess up the signs or terms)
- B: 20% (they might get it right by chance or if they partially understand)
- C: 20% (could result from incorrect addition of the middle terms)
- D: 30% (another plausible incorrect answer)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding but might make careless mistakes.
- A: 15% (less likely to make this specific mistake)
- B: 60% (most should get it right with some understanding of FOIL)
- C: 10% (might result from misadding the terms)
- D: 15% (another possible mistake)

### proficient
Students at this level are expected to consistently apply algebraic rules correctly.
- A: 5% (unlikely, as they understand the method)
- B: 80% (most should get it right)
- C: 5% (unlikely, as they know how to handle signs and terms)
- D: 10% (some might still make a simple mistake)

### advanced
Students at this level have a deep understanding and rarely make mistakes in such straightforward calculations.
- A: 0% (very unlikely)
- B: 95% (almost all should get it right)
- C: 0% (very unlikely)
- D: 5% (rare mistake, if any)
