## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question presents two rectangles with given dimensions and states that their areas are equal. The task is to find the correct equation that represents this equality. The dimensions of the blue rectangle are side length 4 and base \(3x - 2\), and for the yellow rectangle, they are side length 2 and base \(5x + 2\).

## 2: Calculate the Areas
The area of the blue rectangle is \(4 \times (3x - 2)\) and the area of the yellow rectangle is \(2 \times (5x + 2)\). Setting these equal gives:
\[4(3x - 2) = 2(5x + 2)\]

## 3: Expand and Simplify the Equation
Expanding both sides:
\[12x - 8 = 10x + 4\]

## 4: Analyze the Options
- Option A: \(12x - 8 = 10x + 4\), which matches our derived equation.
- Option B: \(12x - 2 = 10x + 2\), not matching.
- Option C: \(8 + 6x - 4 = 4 + 10x + 4\), simplifying gives \(4 + 6x = 8 + 10x\), which does not match.
- Option D: \(4 + 3x - 2 = 2 + 5x + 2\), simplifying gives \(2 + 3x = 4 + 5x\), which does not match.

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic expressions and the concept of area. They might not correctly calculate the areas or set up the equation. Given the simplicity of the algebra in this case, they might still be able to see that option A directly corresponds to the calculation, but errors in calculation or understanding of the concept might lead to a spread across incorrect options. Predicted distribution: A=40% (because it's directly derivable), B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to calculate the areas and set up a simple equation. They are likely to recognize the correct equation but might be tempted by options that look plausible but are incorrect. Predicted distribution: A=60%, B=15%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily derive the correct equation and be less likely to be misled by incorrect options. Predicted distribution: A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students should not only derive the correct equation easily but also be able to quickly dismiss incorrect options. Predicted distribution: A=90%, B=2%, C=3%, D=5%.

## 6: Format the Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
- proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
- advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%
