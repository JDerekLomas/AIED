To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the equation of the \( y \) axis, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The equation of the \( y \) axis is a fundamental concept in coordinate geometry, and it is well-known that the \( y \) axis is represented by the equation \( x = 0 \). This is because any point on the \( y \) axis has an \( x \) coordinate of 0, regardless of its \( y \) coordinate.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question directly asks for the equation of the \( y \) axis. The correct answer is \( x = 0 \), which corresponds to option D.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the \( y \) axis with the \( x \) axis or thinking in terms of \( y = 0 \) for the \( x \) axis. However, the \( y \) axis itself is specifically about the \( x \) coordinate being 0, not the \( y \) coordinate.

## 3: Evaluating Option Choices
- Option A (\( y = 1 \)) and Option B (\( y = 0 \)) might be considered by students who confuse the axes or think of specific lines rather than the axis equations.
- Option C (\( y = x \)) represents a line through the origin with a slope of 1, not an axis.
- Option D (\( x = 0 \)) is the correct equation for the \( y \) axis.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of axes in coordinate geometry. They might choose options based on limited understanding or guesswork. So, A=20% (guessing), B=30% (thinking of the x-axis equation), C=20% (not understanding), D=30% (some basic understanding).
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a foundational understanding but might still make simple mistakes. A=10%, B=20% (confusing with x-axis), C=10%, D=60%.
- **Proficient:** Students here have a solid grasp of coordinate geometry. Misconceptions are less likely, but not unheard of. A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.
- **Advanced:** These students have a deep understanding and are less likely to make errors on such a basic concept. A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the above analysis, here are the predictions:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The best answer is D.
