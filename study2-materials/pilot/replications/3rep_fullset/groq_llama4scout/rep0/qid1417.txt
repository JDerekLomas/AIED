To approach this question, let's analyze the key features of Sunita's journey as described and match them with the characteristics of the graphs provided:

1. **Sunita accelerates quickly**: This means her velocity increases rapidly at the start, which should be represented by a steep upward slope on a velocity-time graph.
2. **Then travels at a constant speed**: This implies a horizontal line on a velocity-time graph, as her velocity is not changing.
3. **Then slowly comes to rest**: This means her velocity decreases gradually to zero, represented by a downward slope on a velocity-time graph.

Given these characteristics:

- **Option A** shows an initial increase in velocity (steep upward slope), then a constant velocity (horizontal line), but then it decreases rapidly to a negative value and then becomes constant again. The rapid decrease might not perfectly match "slowly comes to rest," and the graph going below the x-axis (potentially indicating negative velocity) might confuse some students.
- **Option B** starts at the origin, increases steeply (quick acceleration), then travels horizontally (constant speed), and finally decreases less steeply to zero (slowly comes to rest). This seems to match the description well.
- **Option C** shows acceleration, then constant speed, but then it accelerates upward again, which does not match the description of slowing down.
- **Option D** is not a velocity-time graph; it's described as a graph with distance on the vertical axis, making it irrelevant to the question about velocity-time graphs.

Now, let's predict the performance based on ability levels:

### Below Basic
At this level, students might struggle with interpreting graphs and understanding the relationship between velocity, time, and the description of motion.
- **A**: 20% (some might pick this due to its initial correct features but could be misled by the end)
- **B**: 40% (seems to closely match but requires understanding of each segment)
- **C**: 20% (misinterprets the final slowing down)
- **D**: 20% (misunderstands the type of graph)

### Basic
Students here have a foundational understanding but might make errors in application.
- **A**: 10% (less likely due to the mismatch in the slowing down phase)
- **B**: 60% (matches well with expected understanding)
- **C**: 15% (incorrect interpretation of the final phase)
- **D**: 15% (confusion with graph types)

### Proficient
These students have a solid grasp of concepts and can apply them to solve problems.
- **A**: 5% (unlikely due to clear mismatch)
- **B**: 80% (clear understanding and application)
- **C**: 5% (unlikely due to obvious incorrect final phase)
- **D**: 10% (unlikely, but potential for confusion)

### Advanced
Students at this level have an in-depth understanding and can handle complex applications.
- **A**: 0% (would recognize the incorrect phases)
- **B**: 90% (strong understanding and accurate application)
- **C**: 0% (clearly incorrect)
- **D**: 10% (unlikely but could be due to careless mistake)

Given these analyses:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
