To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \frac{5}{9}-\frac{1}{3} \), let's first solve the problem and then analyze the potential misconceptions or difficulties.

## Step 1: Solve the Problem
To solve \( \frac{5}{9}-\frac{1}{3} \), find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 9. 
\( \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 3}{3 \times 3} = \frac{3}{9} \).
So, \( \frac{5}{9} - \frac{3}{9} = \frac{5 - 3}{9} = \frac{2}{9} \).

## 2: Analyze Potential Misconceptions
- A common misconception could be failing to find a common denominator or incorrectly subtracting the numerators without finding a common denominator.
- Another could be getting the subtraction wrong or misinterpreting the fractions.

## 3: Evaluate the Options with Potential Misconceptions in Mind
- Option A: \( \frac{4}{6} \) could be a result of incorrect simplification or not converting to a common denominator properly.
- Option B: \( \frac{4}{9} \) might result from incorrect subtraction (\( 5 - 1 = 4 \), ignoring the denominator change).
- Option C: \( \frac{8}{9} \) seems unlikely as it would require adding the fractions.
- Option D: \( \frac{2}{9} \) is the correct answer.

## 4: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand fractions well, could struggle with finding a common denominator, and might not perform the subtraction correctly. They might choose A, B, or C due to lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in finding common denominators or in subtraction, potentially choosing A or B.
- **Proficient:** These students understand fractions and can find common denominators. They are less likely to make errors but might still choose B if they mistakenly subtract without adjusting for the denominator.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly unlikely to make errors in such a straightforward problem.

## 5: Predict Percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (incorrect but plausible), B=40% (simple subtraction error), C=10% (unlikely), D=20% (correct but challenging).
- **Basic:** A=20% (some struggle with denominators), B=30% (common error), C=5% (unlikely), D=45% (correct).
- **Proficient:** A=10% (less likely), B=20% (occasional mistake), C=5% (very unlikely), D=65% (correct).
- **Advanced:** A=5% (rare), B=5% (rare), C=0% (extremely unlikely), D=90% (correct).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=5% D=45%
proficient: A=10% B=20% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
