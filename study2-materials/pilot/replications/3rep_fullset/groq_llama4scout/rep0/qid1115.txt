To approach this question, let's first understand what is being tested: the ability to identify when a quadratic equation has no real solutions. A quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) has no real solutions when the discriminant, \(b^2 - 4ac\), is less than 0.

The general form of a quadratic equation's solutions is given by \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\). For no real solutions, \(\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}\) must be imaginary, implying \(b^2 - 4ac < 0\).

## Step 1: Analyze Option A
Option A is \( \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{-12}}{3} \). Here, \(\sqrt{-12}\) implies that \(b^2 - 4ac < 0\) because \(-12 < 0\), suggesting this equation has no real solutions.

## 2: Analyze Option B
Option B is \( \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{12}}{-3} \). The discriminant here is positive (\(\sqrt{12} > 0\)), so this equation has real solutions.

## 3: Analyze Option C
Option C is \( \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{1200}}{3} \). Since \(\sqrt{1200} > 0\), the discriminant is positive, indicating this equation also has real solutions.

## 4: Analyze Option D
Option D is \( \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{0}}{3} \). Here, \(\sqrt{0} = 0\), meaning there is exactly one real solution (or two identical real solutions), not no real solutions.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand the concept of discriminant and may randomly select or choose based on superficial understanding. They might find A appealing because it directly shows a negative under the square root, but could also be confused by the presentation. A=60% (assuming they recognize the negative under the square root), B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of quadratic equations but might not fully understand the implications of the discriminant. They are likely to recognize A as having no real solutions. A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.

- **Proficient**: These students understand quadratic equations and the role of the discriminant. They should easily identify A as the equation with no real solutions. A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concept but can apply it quickly. They will have no trouble identifying A. A=99%, B=0.5%, C=0.3%, D=0.2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.3% D=0.2%
