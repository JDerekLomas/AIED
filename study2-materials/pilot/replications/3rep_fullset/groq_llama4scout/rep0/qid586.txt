## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to simplify \( \sqrt{48} \) as much as possible. This involves finding square factors of 48 to simplify the radical.

## 2: Identifying Square Factors of 48
48 can be broken down into \( 48 = 16 \times 3 \), and since \( 16 = 4^2 \), it is a square number. Therefore, \( \sqrt{48} = \sqrt{16 \times 3} = \sqrt{16} \times \sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3} \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 16\sqrt{3} \) is incorrect because \( \sqrt{48} \) does not simplify to \( 16\sqrt{3} \); it simplifies to \( 4\sqrt{3} \).
- Option B: \( 4\sqrt{12} \) is incorrect because while \( \sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \times 3} = 2\sqrt{3} \), \( 4\sqrt{12} = 4 \times 2\sqrt{3} = 8\sqrt{3} \), not \( \sqrt{48} \).
- Option C: \( 4\sqrt{3} \) is correct as shown in Step 2.
- Option D: \( 2\sqrt{12} \) simplifies to \( 2\sqrt{4 \times 3} = 2 \times 2\sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3} \), which is correct but let's see how students might react.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand how to simplify radicals or might not recognize that 16 is a square number. They might choose A or B due to confusion or incorrect factorization. Option A seems plausible if students mistakenly think \( \sqrt{48} = 16\sqrt{3} \) without properly factoring. Option B could be chosen if students factor 48 into 4 and 12 but don't simplify further. \( A=40\% B=30\% C=20\% D=10\% \).
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might make careless errors. They might recognize 16 as a square but could struggle with simplifying \( \sqrt{12} \). \( A=20\% B=25\% C=45\% D=10\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students should easily identify \( 4\sqrt{3} \) as the correct answer. They understand square roots and factorization. \( A=5\% B=10\% C=80\% D=5\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also apply it quickly. They might double-check their work but are less likely to make errors. \( A=0\% B=0\% C=95\% D=5\% \).

## 5: Final Prediction
Given the analysis, the predicted percentages are:
- below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
- basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
