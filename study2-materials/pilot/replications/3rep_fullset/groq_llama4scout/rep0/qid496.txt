To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks for the correct algebraic convention for the expression \(y \times x + b \times 3\). The correct algebraic convention would dictate that we write this as \(xy + 3b\), following the rules that multiplication is commutative (order doesn't change the product, e.g., \(y \times x = x \times y\)) and that in algebraic expressions, multiplication is often denoted by juxtaposition (e.g., \(b \times 3 = 3b\)).

## Step 1: Understanding the Algebraic Convention
The expression given is \(y \times x + b \times 3\). Using algebraic conventions, this should be written as \(xy + 3b\), which matches option B.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception among students could be the incorrect ordering of variables or the incorrect handling of constants. For instance, some might write the expression with the variables in a different order or might not correctly juxtapose or omit the multiplication symbol.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic notation. They might not understand the convention for writing \(y \times x\) as \(yx\) or \(xy\), and similarly, \(b \times 3\) as \(3b\). Option A (\(yx + b3\)) might appeal to those who do not understand algebraic notation properly. Option D (\(3bxy\)) incorrectly multiplies all terms together. Option C (\(y + 3bx\)) misinterprets the original expression entirely. Therefore, we might expect:
  - A: 40% (incorrect but follows a naive approach)
  - B: 20% (understands basic algebraic conventions)
  - C: 20% (misinterprets the expression)
  - D: 20% (misinterprets multiplication)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make mistakes. They are more likely to recognize \(yx\) as \(xy\) and \(b \times 3\) as \(3b\), but might still be tricked by simple misunderstandings.
  - A: 20%
  - B: 50%
  - C: 15%
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient:** These students are familiar with algebraic conventions and should easily identify the correct expression.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 80%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 10%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are not only proficient but also have a deep understanding. They should almost universally choose the correct option.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 95%
  - C: 0%
  - D: 5%

The best answer is B. 

Given the analysis, here is the formatted prediction:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
