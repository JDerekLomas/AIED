To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or understanding related to the order of operations.

The question is: \(10-8 \times 7+6=\)

Which calculation should you do first?

## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
The order of operations is a fundamental concept in mathematics, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) in the UK. According to BIDMAS, in an expression without brackets, multiplication and division should be performed before addition and subtraction.

## 2: Analyzing the Question
The given expression is \(10-8 \times 7+6\). Following BIDMAS, the first operation to perform would be the multiplication, which is \(8 \times 7\).

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception among students is not following the order of operations correctly, often leading to performing operations in the order they appear from left to right, or incorrectly identifying which operation to perform first.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand or have a weak grasp of the order of operations. They might choose operations based on their appearance from left to right or based on what seems easiest. 
  - A: \(7+6\) seems unlikely as it doesn't follow a straightforward left-to-right approach.
  - B: \(10-8\) could be a plausible first step for some, as it starts from the left.
  - C: \(8 \times 7\) requires understanding of BIDMAS.
  - D: "It doesn't matter" suggests a lack of understanding of the order of operations.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the need for multiplication before addition/subtraction but might still be tempted by left-to-right processing.
  
- **Proficient**: Students here have a good grasp of BIDMAS and are less likely to make errors regarding the order of operations. They should predominantly choose \(8 \times 7\).

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand BIDMAS but are also likely to apply it correctly without hesitation.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=10% (unlikely, as it jumps to addition), B=40% (starting from the left), C=20% (some understanding of priorities), D=30% (lack of understanding).
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=20%, C=60% (most understand the priority of multiplication), D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=2%, B=5%, C=90%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=1%, B=2%, C=95%, D=2%.

The best answer is C. 

Therefore, in the exact format requested:
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
