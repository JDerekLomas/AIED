To approach this question, let's analyze the concepts involved and how they might affect students at different ability levels.

The question revolves around the properties of congruent shapes, specifically focusing on reflection and rotation. Congruent shapes are those that have the same size and shape. Reflection and rotation are two types of transformations that can be applied to shapes:

1. **Reflection** involves flipping a shape over a line (the mirror line), and
2. **Rotation** involves turning a shape around a point by a certain angle.

Both of these transformations result in a shape that is congruent to the original shape.

- A student with a **below_basic** level might not fully understand the concepts of reflection, rotation, or congruence. They might not be able to distinguish between different types of transformations or might believe that only certain types of transformations preserve congruence.

- A student at the **basic** level would have a foundational understanding of these concepts but might be more prone to making errors when applying them, especially if the question's context doesn't immediately trigger their recall of these properties.

- A **proficient** student would have a solid grasp of geometric transformations and their effects on shapes, including understanding that both reflection and rotation preserve congruence.

- An **advanced** student not only understands these concepts but can also apply them in more complex contexts and reason about their implications.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic:** These students might struggle with the terminology or the concepts. They might incorrectly believe that only one of the transformations preserves congruence or neither does. Option C (Both Tom and Katie) requires an understanding that both reflection and rotation preserve congruence. Given the simplicity of the question and the direct nature of the statements, there's a chance that some might pick D (Neither is correct) due to a lack of understanding, but more likely, they'd choose an option that isolates one correct statement or both. **A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%**

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might be slightly more prone to errors. They are likely to understand that one or both statements are correct. **A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%**

- **Proficient:** These students are likely to confidently select C (Both Tom and Katie), as they understand that both reflection and rotation result in a congruent shape. **A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%**

- **Advanced:** These students have a deep understanding and are very unlikely to make errors on such a straightforward question. **A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%**

So, in the specified format:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
