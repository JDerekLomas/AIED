To approach this question, let's consider what it tests: the ability to simplify fractions. The fraction given is \( \frac{45}{60} \). To simplify it, one needs to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 45 and 60 and divide both the numerator and the denominator by this GCD.

The GCD of 45 and 60 is 15. So, \( \frac{45}{60} \) simplifies to \( \frac{45 \div 15}{60 \div 15} = \frac{3}{4} \).

Now, let's consider the potential misconceptions or errors and the abilities of students:

1. **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic fraction concepts, including simplification. They might not know how to find the GCD or might not understand the concept of simplifying fractions. 
   - Option A (\( \frac{9}{12} \)) could be a result of dividing both numerator and denominator by 5.
   - Option C (\( \frac{21}{28} \)) seems unrelated and might be a guess or a result of a completely incorrect simplification.
   - Option D (Cannot be simplified) might be chosen by those who do not understand the concept of simplification.

2. **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic concepts but might make errors due to carelessness or not fully understanding the simplification process. They are more likely to simplify correctly but could be tempted by options that seem like they could be correct.

3. **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of GCD and can simplify fractions. They are less likely to make errors but might still choose incorrect options if they are distracted or make a calculation mistake.

4. **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident in their ability to simplify fractions and are less likely to choose incorrect options.

Given these considerations, here are the predicted percentages:

- **Below Basic**: 
  - A (\( \frac{9}{12} \)) = 20% (some might simplify by dividing by 5)
  - B (\( \frac{3}{4} \)) = 10% (correct but might be a guess)
  - C (\( \frac{21}{28} \)) = 15% (unrelated guess)
  - D (Cannot be simplified) = 55% (lack of understanding)

- **Basic**:
  - A (\( \frac{9}{12} \)) = 15%
  - B (\( \frac{3}{4} \)) = 70%
  - C (\( \frac{21}{28} \)) = 5%
  - D (Cannot be simplified) = 10%

- **Proficient**:
  - A (\( \frac{9}{12} \)) = 5%
  - B (\( \frac{3}{4} \)) = 90%
  - C (\( \frac{21}{28} \)) = 2%
  - D (Cannot be simplified) = 3%

- **Advanced**:
  - A (\( \frac{9}{12} \)) = 1%
  - B (\( \frac{3}{4} \)) = 98%
  - C (\( \frac{21}{28} \)) = 0%
  - D (Cannot be simplified) = 1%

So, in the required format:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=15% D=55%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%
