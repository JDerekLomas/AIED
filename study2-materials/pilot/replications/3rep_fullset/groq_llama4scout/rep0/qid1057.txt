To approach this question, let's consider what makes it easy or hard and how students at different ability levels might respond.

The expression given is \(p^{2}+100p\). This is a straightforward factorisation question that tests the student's ability to apply the method of taking out a common factor. The correct answer is \(p(p+100)\), which corresponds to option A.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not recognise that \(p^{2}+100p\) can be factorised by taking \(p\) as a common factor. There's a possibility they might try to factorise it like a quadratic equation or look for two numbers that multiply to \(0\) and add to \(100\), which doesn't apply here directly. They might be tempted by options that suggest a factorisation that isn't immediately apparent or doesn't apply, such as B and C, which are incorrect factorisations. Option D, "Does not factorise," might also appeal to students who don't see an obvious factorisation. Given the simplicity of the correct factorisation, I'd predict:
  - A=40% (recognise the common factor \(p\))
  - B=20% (mistakenly apply difference of squares or incorrect factorisation)
  - C=10% (incorrectly trying to factor as a perfect square)
  - D=30% (not recognising the factorisation)

- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a better grasp of basic algebra and be more likely to spot that \(p\) is a common factor. However, they might still be prone to making simple mistakes or not checking their work thoroughly.
  - A=70% (correct factorisation)
  - B=15% (some might still confuse with other factorisation types)
  - C=5% (less likely to think it's a perfect square)
  - D=10% (fewer think it doesn't factorise)

- **Proficient**: Students here should easily recognise \(p\) as a common factor and be less likely to fall for incorrect factorisations.
  - A=90% (easily identify \(p\) as a common factor)
  - B=5% (unlikely to confuse with difference of squares)
  - C=2% (very unlikely to think it's a perfect square)
  - D=3% (unlikely to think it doesn't factorise)

- **Advanced**: These students are likely to not only quickly identify the factorisation but also understand why other options are incorrect. They might even simplify or manipulate expressions like this with ease.
  - A=95% (very confident in factorisation)
  - B=2% (unlikely to make basic mistakes)
  - C=1% (extremely unlikely to make a mistake like this)
  - D=2% (understand when expressions can or cannot be factorised)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
