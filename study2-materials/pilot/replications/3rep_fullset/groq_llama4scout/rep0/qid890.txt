## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential misconceptions
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \( m(m-2) \). This is a basic algebra question that tests the student's understanding of distributing a term across a difference within brackets.

## 2: Identify common misconceptions
A common misconception when expanding brackets is not multiplying each term inside the brackets by the term outside. For the expression \( m(m-2) \), students might incorrectly expand it as \( m - 2m \) (which simplifies to \( -m \)), or they might simply add the terms without applying the distributive property, or not simplify correctly.

## 3: Analyze option A
Option A is \( 2m - 2 \). This option suggests a misunderstanding of the distributive property, as it seems to imply that \( m \) times \( m \) equals \( 2m \) and \( m \) times \( -2 \) equals \( -2 \), which does not align with algebraic rules.

## 4: Analyze option B
Option B is \( m^2 - 2m \). This is the correct expansion of \( m(m-2) \) using the distributive property: \( m \times m = m^2 \) and \( m \times -2 = -2m \), so \( m^2 - 2m \).

## 5: Analyze option C
Option C is \( 2m - 2m \). This option suggests a significant misunderstanding, as it implies \( m(m-2) \) equals \( 0 \), which is not correct.

## 6: Analyze option D
Option D is \( m^2 - 2 \). This option shows a partial understanding, as \( m \times m = m^2 \) is correct, but \( m \times -2 = -2m \) is incorrectly simplified to \( -2 \).

## 7: Consider student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might choose options that reflect a lack of understanding of the distributive property or incorrect simplification.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors, especially if the question triggers a common misconception.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the distributive property and can apply it correctly but might occasionally make careless mistakes.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to understand the concept well and apply it correctly.

## 8: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple but incorrect), B=20% (correct but challenging), C=20% (misconception), D=20% (partially correct but incorrect).
- **Basic**: A=20% (misconception), B=60% (correct), C=10% (misconception), D=10% (partially correct).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (careless), B=90% (correct), C=2% (misconception), D=3% (partially correct).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (unlikely), B=98% (correct), C=0% (unlikely), D=2% (rare mistake).

## 9: Convert predictions to requested format
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=0% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=0% D=2%
