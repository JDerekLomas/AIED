To tackle this question, let's consider what's being tested and how students at different ability levels might respond.

The question tests the application of ratio to find a missing quantity. The ratio given is \(3:7\), and Josh receives \(£84\), which corresponds to the part of the ratio that is \(3\). Students need to use this information to find out how much Lucy receives, which corresponds to the \(7\) part of the ratio.

## Step 1: Understanding the Ratio
The total parts of the ratio are \(3 + 7 = 10\) parts.

## 2: Finding the Value of One Part
Josh's \(£84\) represents \(3\) parts, so to find out how much \(1\) part is worth, we divide \(£84\) by \(3\): \(£84 \div 3 = £28\).

## 3: Calculating Lucy's Share
Lucy's share corresponds to \(7\) parts, so we multiply \(£28\) (the value of \(1\) part) by \(7\): \(£28 \times 7 = £196\).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A common error might be to directly use the ratio without finding the value of one part or misapplying the given amount to the wrong part of the ratio.
- Another potential mistake could involve incorrect calculations or not using the given information effectively.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of ratios and proportional reasoning. They might incorrectly calculate or not understand how to apply the ratio to find Lucy's share. Option A seems correct based on our calculation, but these students might not get it. Let's assume a high chance of error: A=20% (if they somehow stumble upon it), B=30% (random guess), C=20% (might think it's directly related to Josh's amount), D=30% (another random guess).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of ratios but might make simple calculation errors. They are more likely to attempt the correct method but could falter. Let's assume A=60% (correct calculation), B=20% (error in calculation), C=10% (misinterpretation), D=10% (simple mistake).
- **Proficient**: These students understand ratios well and are less likely to make errors in calculation. They should easily find that Lucy's share is \(£196\), so A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: This group will almost certainly get it right, as they are comfortable with ratios and can apply them accurately. Thus, A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

## 6: Adjusting Predictions
Given the calculations and potential for error, let's refine:
- **Below Basic**: A=10% B=25% C=25% D=40%
- **Basic**: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=85% B=10% C=4% D=1%
- **Advanced**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
