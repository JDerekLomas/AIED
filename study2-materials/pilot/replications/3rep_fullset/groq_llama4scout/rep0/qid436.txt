To predict the performance of students at different ability levels on the question \( (-5)+(-2)= \), let's consider what the question tests and the common misconceptions associated with adding negative numbers.

The question tests the understanding of adding two negative numbers, which should result in a more negative number (or a smaller number on the number line). A common misconception is to think that two negative numbers will add to a positive number or to ignore the signs and just add the numbers.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The most common error for students who are not proficient in handling negative numbers is to either add the numbers as if they were both positive (resulting in \( 5 + 2 = 7 \), but then incorrectly applying the signs) or to mistakenly believe that two negative numbers make a positive.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( -7 \), which is the correct answer. For students to choose this, they must understand that adding two negative numbers results in a negative number and that \( -5 + (-2) = -7 \).

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( 7 \). This would be a common mistake if students ignore the negative signs and simply add \( 5 + 2 = 7 \), not realizing that both numbers are negative.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( 3 \). This option might seem plausible for students who are confused but not as straightforwardly incorrect as option B without some form of sign error or incorrect operation.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \( -3 \). This could be a result of mistakenly adding the numbers and then mishandling the signs, or simply subtracting one from the other.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand negative number operations well. They might choose B (thinking two negatives make a positive) or even C or D due to confusion. A=20% (some might get it by chance or have a basic understanding), B=40% (common misconception), C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle. They are more likely to get it right or make simple mistakes. A=60%, B=25%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the operations with negative numbers well. A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong and flexible understanding of number operations, including with negatives. A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The answer is below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%.
