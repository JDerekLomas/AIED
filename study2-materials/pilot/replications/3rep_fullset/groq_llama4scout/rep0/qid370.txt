## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests
The question provides a table of values for the equation \(y = 2x + c\) and asks students to find the value that should replace the star (\(\bigstar\)) in the table. The table is:
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l}
\( x \) & \( \) & \( 0 \) & \( 3 \) \\
\hline\( y \) & \( -7 \) & \( -5 \) & \( \bigstar \) \\
\end{tabular}
To find \(c\), students can use any pair of \(x\) and \(y\) values. Using \(x = 0\) and \(y = -5\), we substitute into \(y = 2x + c\) to get \(-5 = 2(0) + c\), which simplifies to \(c = -5\). Then, using \(x = 3\), we find \(y = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1\).

## 2: Identify the common misconception
A common misconception might involve incorrectly substituting values into the equation or misinterpreting the equation's form. However, this question seems straightforward as it directly tests the ability to substitute values into a linear equation and solve for the unknown.

## 3: Analyze the difficulty level for different abilities
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with substituting into the equation or solving for \(c\) and then \(y\). They might not correctly identify \(c\) or might miscalculate \(y\) for \(x = 3\).
- **Basic:** Students here should be able to follow a straightforward substitution and calculation but might make errors in calculation or in setting up the equation.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily solve for \(c\) using one set of values and then find \(y\) for \(x = 3\) with minimal chance of error.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only solve the problem easily but also be able to verify their solution or approach.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the equation \(y = 2x - 5\), let's calculate:
- For \(x = 3\), \(y = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1\).

## 5: Estimate student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Might not understand how to use the given equation properly. Could guess or incorrectly calculate. Let's assume A=20% (guessing), B=30% (miscalculation), C=30% (getting it right by chance or correct calculation), D=20% (another miscalculation).
- **Basic:** Should be able to get it right with some effort. So, A=10%, B=20%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Very likely to get it right. So, A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Almost certainly get it right. So, A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 6: Refine estimates based on the specific question
The correct answer is \(C = 1\). The question seems to test direct substitution and calculation rather than a deep conceptual understanding, making it accessible.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=3% C=90% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=98% D=2%
