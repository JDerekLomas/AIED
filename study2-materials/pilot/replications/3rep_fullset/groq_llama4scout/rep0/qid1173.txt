To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, we need to consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions related to inequalities.

The question asks which statement shows that \( t \) is greater than \( 9 \). The correct answer is \( D: t > 9 \).

- **A: \( t < 9 \)** suggests \( t \) is less than \( 9 \), which is the opposite of what we're looking for.
- **B: \( t = 9 \)** suggests \( t \) is equal to \( 9 \), not greater than \( 9 \).
- **C: \( t \leq 9 \)** suggests \( t \) is less than or equal to \( 9 \), which also does not show \( t \) is greater than \( 9 \).
- **D: \( t > 9 \)** directly states \( t \) is greater than \( 9 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question tests the understanding of inequalities and the ability to identify when a statement implies \( t > 9 \). A common misconception could be confusing the direction of the inequality or not understanding that \( t \leq 9 \) and \( t < 9 \) do not imply \( t > 9 \).

## 2: Analyzing by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic inequality understanding. They might choose \( A \) or \( C \) thinking that being less than or less than/equal to could somehow imply greater than, or they might choose \( B \) because it seems close. \( D \) should still be recognizable as the correct answer by some, but errors will be high.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes. They are more likely to eliminate \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) but might still struggle with the concept, potentially leading to a higher percentage choosing the incorrect options compared to higher ability levels.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of inequalities and should easily identify \( D \) as the correct answer. Mistakes might come from not reading carefully, but overall, they should perform well.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and should not make errors on this type of question.

## 3: Predicting Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the clear distinction between the correct and incorrect options:
- **Below Basic:** Might struggle significantly, potentially \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 15\% \), \( C = 25\% \), \( D = 40\% \).
- **Basic:** Should do better than below basic but still make some mistakes, potentially \( A = 10\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 75\% \).
- **Proficient:** Should have a high accuracy rate, potentially \( A = 2\% \), \( B = 1\% \), \( C = 2\% \), \( D = 95\% \).
- **Advanced:** Should almost universally get it correct, potentially \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 0\% \), \( C = 0\% \), \( D = 100\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=10% D=75%
proficient: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
