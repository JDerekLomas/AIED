To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing: the understanding that quadratic functions can have graphs that are either a positive parabola (U-shaped) or a negative parabola (inverted U-shaped). The question essentially checks if students recognize both types of parabolas as valid representations of quadratic functions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The misconception here could be that some students might only associate quadratic functions with one type of parabola, either the positive (U-shaped) or the negative (inverted U-shaped), but not both.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A (Only Tom) would be chosen by students who only recognize positive parabolas as quadratic.
- Option B (Only Katie) would be chosen by students who only recognize negative parabolas as quadratic.
- Option C (Both Tom and Katie) would be chosen by students who understand that both positive and negative parabolas can represent quadratic functions.
- Option D (Neither is correct) would be chosen by students who do not think either graph represents a quadratic function, which seems unlikely given that both graphs clearly depict parabolas.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with basic graph recognition and understanding of function types. They might not fully grasp the concept of quadratic functions having two forms (U-shaped and inverted U-shaped).
- A: 40% (assuming some recognize the U-shaped graph)
- B: 30% (assuming some recognize the inverted U-shaped graph)
- C: 20% (students who understand both are correct, which might be a stretch for this level)
- D: 10% (students who don't think either is correct, possibly due to confusion)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of quadratic functions and should be familiar with both U-shaped and inverted U-shaped graphs.
- A: 20%
- B: 20%
- C: 55% (most understand both are quadratic)
- D: 5%

### proficient
Proficient students have a solid understanding of quadratic functions and their graphs.
- A: 5%
- B: 5%
- C: 80% (clear understanding of both types)
- D: 10%

### advanced
Advanced students not only understand but can also apply their knowledge of quadratic functions and graphs.
- A: 0%
- B: 0%
- C: 95% (almost all understand both are correct)
- D: 5%

## 4: Conclusion
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
- basic: A=20% B=20% C=55% D=5%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
