## Step 1: Understand the question and the sequence
The question presents a descending linear sequence with a constant difference of \( 22 \) and states that the \( 3^{\text {rd }} \) term is \( 712 \). We need to find the first term, denoted by \( \bigstar \).

## 2: Determine the formula for the nth term of a linear sequence
The formula for the nth term of a linear sequence is given by \( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \), where \( a_n \) is the nth term, \( a_1 \) is the first term, \( n \) is the term number, and \( d \) is the common difference.

## 3: Apply given information to the formula
Given that the \( 3^{\text {rd }} \) term (\( a_3 \)) is \( 712 \) and the common difference (\( d \)) is \( -22 \) (since the sequence is descending), we can substitute these into the formula: \( 712 = a_1 + (3-1)(-22) \).

## 4: Solve for the first term \( a_1 \)
Simplifying the equation: \( 712 = a_1 + 2(-22) \)
\( 712 = a_1 - 44 \)
\( a_1 = 712 + 44 \)
\( a_1 = 756 \)

## 5: Analyze the difficulty of the question
This question requires the application of the formula for the nth term of a linear sequence and solving for the first term. The sequence is descending with a negative common difference, which might catch some students out if they mistakenly use a positive difference. However, the numbers are straightforward, and the concept is basic.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with applying the formula correctly or understanding the concept of a descending sequence. They might incorrectly add or subtract the common difference or not apply it at all. Option A (756) seems likely for students who can calculate but might not fully understand the sequence's direction or incorrectly apply the difference.
- **Basic**: Students here should understand the sequence concept but might make calculation errors. They are likely to choose the correct answer (A: 756) if they apply the formula correctly.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve the problem with minimal errors, choosing A (756) as the correct answer.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will not only choose the correct answer (A: 756) but might also be able to explain their reasoning clearly.

## 7: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
Given the straightforward nature of the question once the formula is applied:
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (correct calculation but might not understand sequence direction), B=20% (might add instead of subtract), C=10% (random error), D=10% (random error).
- **Basic**: A=80% (correct application of formula), B=10% (minor calculation error), C=5% (misunderstanding of sequence), D=5% (misunderstanding of sequence).
- **Proficient**: A=95% (easy and straightforward), B=3% (calculation mistake), C=1% (misunderstanding), D=1% (misunderstanding).
- **Advanced**: A=99% (no errors expected), B=0.5% (extremely rare mistake), C=0.25% (extremely rare), D=0.25% (extremely rare).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
