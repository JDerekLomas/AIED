## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a conversion graph between pints and litres, with a straight line passing through the origin and the point (35,20). The task is to estimate the number of pints equivalent to 50 litres.

## 2: Analyzing the Graph
Given that the line passes through (35,20), we can determine the conversion rate. The slope of the line (which represents the conversion rate) can be calculated as $20 \, \text{pints} / 35 \, \text{litres}$. This simplifies to approximately $0.5714 \, \text{pints/litre}$.

## 3: Calculating the Conversion for 50 Litres
To find the number of pints equivalent to 50 litres, we multiply 50 litres by the conversion rate: $50 \, \text{litres} \times 0.5714 \, \text{pints/litre} \approx 28.57 \, \text{pints}$.

## 4: Evaluating the Options
- Option A: $87$ pints
- Option B: $23$ pints
- Option C: $28$ pints
- Option D: $85$ pints

## 5: Identifying the Best Estimate
The calculation yields approximately $28.57$ pints for $50$ litres. The closest option to this calculation is $28$ pints.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with reading the graph or understanding the concept of conversion. They might incorrectly estimate or choose an option far from the calculated value. Option A and D seem too high, and B seems too low, so they might be tempted by these due to lack of understanding. $A=20\%$, $B=30\%$, $C=30\%$, $D=20\%$.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might make simple calculation errors or misread the graph. They are more likely to choose an option close to their rough estimate. $A=5\%$, $B=15\%$, $C=70\%$, $D=10\%$.
- **Proficient**: These students can accurately read the graph and perform calculations. They should easily identify that $28$ pints is the closest estimate. $A=2\%$, $B=5\%$, $C=90\%$, $D=3\%$.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the conversion but can also quickly estimate and verify their answers. They are likely to confirm that $28$ pints is the correct estimate with minimal chance of error. $A=1\%$, $B=2\%$, $C=95\%$, $D=2\%$.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
