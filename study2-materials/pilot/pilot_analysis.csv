Question: James has 20 cookies. He gives away 20 × 0.25 of them. How many does he give away?

A) 25
B) 5
C) 15
D) 8

Reasoning:","To find out how many cookies James gives away, we need to multiply the total number of cookies (20) by the fraction of cookies he gives away (0.25).

Let's convert the fraction 0.25 into a decimal:
0.25 * 10 = 2.5, so 0.25 = 2.5 / 10 = 25 / 1000

Now, we can calculate the number of cookies he gives away:
20 * (25/1000) = (20 * 25) / 1000 = 500 / 1000 = 0.5

Since we cannot give away a fraction of a cookie, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, James gives away 1 cookie.

However, since the question asks for the number of cookies he gave away as a percentage of the total he had, we can also express this as a percentage:
1 cookie / 20 cookies = 1 / 20

To convert this into a percentage, we multiply by 100%:
(1/20) * 100% = 5%

So, if we answer in terms of percentage, option B) 5% is the correct answer. However, if we answer in terms of whole cookies, James gave away 1 cookie, so option C) 15 is not a valid answer since it is not equal to 20 × 0.25.

Question: James has 20 cookies. He gives away 20 × 0.25 of them. How many does he give away?

A) 25
B) 5
C) 15
D) 8

Reasoning:","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate 20 × 0.25.

Multiplication is done by repeated addition, so:

20 × 0.25 = 20 + 20 + 20 + ... + 0.25 (20 times)

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 + 20 + 20 + ... + 0.25 = 20(1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 0.0125)

The expression in the parentheses represents a geometric series where a = 1 and r = 0.0125 (the common ratio). To find the sum of a geometric series, we can use the formula:

Sum = a / (1 - r)

In our case, a = 1 and r = 0.0125:

Sum = 1 / (1 - 0.0125)
Sum = 1 / (0.9875)
Sum ≈ 1.0183

Now, since we need the total number of cookies given away, which is 20 times the sum calculated above:

Total cookies given away = 20 * Sum
Total cookies given away ≈ 20 * 1.0183
Total cookies given away ≈ 20.37

Since it's not possible to give away a fraction of a cookie, we round the number to the nearest whole number:

Total cookies given away ≈ 21

However, since James started with 20 cookies, he cannot give away more than he has. So, we know that the number of cookies given away must be less than or equal to 20.

Looking at the answer choices, the closest number to our rounded result is 21 - 1 = 20 - 1, which is 19. However, none of the given answer choices is 19. Since the question asks for the number of cookies James gives away and not the difference in the number of cookies he has, we should choose the closest answer from the given options.

Your thinking:","Alright, let's solve this problem. I know that multiplication works with numbers and the 'x' symbol. So, if James has 20 cookies and gives away 20 times something, that ""something"" must be the number of cookies he's giving away.

The problem says he's giving away 20 times 0.25. I'm not sure what that means exactly, but I think it's a decimal. I remember that decimals are just normal numbers that have a fractional part.

So, I'll try to multiply 20 by 0.25. I'll line up the decimal places and do it like this:

20 (ones)
- 0 (tens)
- 2 (hundreds)
- 5 (thousands)

Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake. There's no such thing as 0.005 ones, only tenths and hundredths. I should have added 0.25 directly to 20 instead of converting it to a mixed number.

James gives away 20.25 cookies, but since we're looking for whole cookies, I'll round it down to the nearest whole number.

Multiplication is repeated addition, so I know that 0.5 (or 1/2) can be thought of as adding half as many times as you can count up to 1.

So, if I'm adding half twice, I should be adding the same as adding half and then half again. That's like adding a whole and then a half, which is 1.5. But wait, this problem asks for a decimal answer, so I need to convert 1.5 to a decimal.

I know that 1 is 10/10, so if I add 5/10, that's like adding 5 parts out of 10. To find this decimal, I just divide 5 by 10, which gives me 0.5.

Reasoning:","To solve this problem, we need to compare the two fractions. The order of comparison between fractions with unlike denominators can be done by converting them into similar fractions (having the same denominator).

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 5 and 7. The LCM of 5 and 7 is 35.

Your thinking:","Alright, let's compare these two fractions. To do that, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 7 is 35. So, let's multiply both the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the number needed to get 35.

However, I made a mistake in my calculations. I should have multiplied the denominator by the least common multiple (35) and then compared the fractions as they are. Since 2/5 < 1, and 2/7 is greater than 1/7, we don't need to convert the fractions to have the same denominator.

So, the correct answer is A) 2/7, but the reasoning I used had a mistake. I'll remember to compare the fractions as they are when the denominators are not the same.

Lesson learned!",A,"Alright, let's compare these two fractions. To do that, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 7 is 35. So, let's multiply both the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the number needed to get 35.

For 2/5, we need to multiply by 7 (since 7 * 5 = 35). So, 2 * 7 = 14 and 5 * 7 = 35. Now, we have 14/35 for 2/5.

For 2/7, we need to multiply by 5 (since 5 * 7 = 35). So, 2 * 5 = 10 and 7 * 5 = 35. Now, we have 10/35 for 2/7.

Reasoning:","To solve this problem, we need to compare the fractions representing the portions eaten by Sarah and Tom.

1. Sarah ate 1/6 of the pizza.
2. Tom ate 1/4 of the pizza.

Now let's denote the total pizza as P:
- Sarah ate P * (1/6)
- Tom ate P * (1/4)

Since both Sarah and Tom ate parts of the same pizza, we can set their eaten portions equal to each other and solve for P:

P * (1/6) = P * (1/4)

To eliminate P from both sides, we'll cross-multiply:

6 * P = 4 * P

Now, subtract P from both sides:

6 * P - P = 4 * P - P

This simplifies to:

5 * P = 3 * P

To compare them, we need to find a common fraction that both can be written as. I know that 4 times 3 equals 12, so 1/4 can be written as 3/12. But 1/6 is not easily convertible to 3/12 directly.

However, we can find a common multiple of 6 and 12. The least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 12 is 12. So, we can write 1/6 as 2/12. Now, both fractions are using the same denominator, which makes comparison easier.

Question: Which fraction is closest to 1: 3/4 or 5/8?

A) 5/8
B) 3/4
C) They are equally close
D) Neither is close to 1

Your thinking:","First, I need to compare the size of the fractions 3/4 and 5/8. I know that a fraction is closer to 1 when its numerator is larger or when both the numerator and denominator are smaller.

Let's see if that helps me decide which fraction is closer to 1 between 3/4 and 5/8.

I notice that the numerator of 5/8 is larger than the numerator of 3/4, but the denominator of 5/8 is smaller. So, the value of 5/8 is less than 1, but it is closer to 1 than 3/4, which is less than 1.

So my answer would be A) 5/8.

But wait! I should check my thinking. If I were to find the decimal equivalent of each fraction and compare them, it might help me understand better.

To find the decimal equivalent of a fraction, I can divide the numerator by the denominator.

3/4 = 0.75
5/8 = 0.625

Now I can see that 0.625 is closer to 1 than 0.75. So I made an error in my initial thinking. The correct answer should be D) Neither is close to 1, because both fractions are less than 1.

83 is a bit bigger than 45, so I think the difference should be less than 83. Let's start by subtracting 5 from 83, just to see if it's in the right ballpark.

83 - 5 = 78

Whoops, that's too big. Let's try subtracting 10 this time:

83 - 10 = 73

Still too big. Let's keep going. How about 15?

83 - 15 = 68

Nope, that's still too big. Maybe if I subtract 20, it might be right:

83 - 20 = 63

Well, 63 is definitely smaller than 83, but it's also less than 45. That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my numbers again.

83 - 20 = 63, but that's too small. I should have subtracted a smaller number after 15.

Let's try 10 again:

83 - 10 = 73

Aha! That's still too big, but it gave me an idea. If 83 - 10 is too big, maybe I should have subtracted a larger number after 5.

Let's try 20:

83 - 20 = 63

Nope, that's still too small.

Let me try again. I'll start by subtracting 5:

83 - 5 = 78

Still too big. I made a mistake earlier and subtracted 10 when I should have subtracted 15.

83 - 15 = 68

That seems right! I've subtracted 15 from 83, and I'm left with 68. But wait, I forgot to check my answer choices.

Your thinking:","Alright, so I know that when you subtract a smaller number from a larger one, the result should be bigger than the larger number. But that's not the case here. Let's try to solve it:

Question: Calculate: 71 - 29

A) 58
B) 42
C) 52

Reasoning:","Here's the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:

1. Identify the numbers given in the problem, which are 71 and 29.
2. Subtract the second number (29) from the first number (71).

The subtraction operation follows the standard order: larger number minus smaller number. So, you start by finding the difference of the digits in the ones place: 1 (from 71) minus 9 (from 29). This gives us a difference of 1 - 9 = -8.

Since the result is negative, we need to carry that negative difference to the tens place and adjust the digit in the ones place accordingly. When we carry -8 to the tens place, it becomes 8 with a value of -80.

Now, we have an adjusted 1 in the ones place, and we have to account for the -80 from the tens place. We add 80 (since we want to subtract, we're actually adding its opposite, or negative, to the sum) to the tens place.

So, the tens place now has a value of 8, and the ones place has a value of 1.

Now, we have the sum of the numbers:

-80 (tens place) + 1 (ones place) = -79 (but we were given 71 as the first number, so we add 100 to our result).

So, the solution to the problem is 100 - 79 = 21.

Question: A rectangle has length 6cm and width 4cm. What is its perimeter?

C) 10cm

Your thinking:","Alright, let's solve this problem. I know that the perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the length, width, and twice the length because we need to account for both sides of the rectangle. So, I have:

At this point, I might write something like ""8 times 3 equals 24"" on my paper. But then I realize that I've only found one of the factors of the area, not both. I need to square one of the factors to get the area. So, I remember that squaring a number means multiplying it by itself.

Question: A square garden has a perimeter of 36m. What is the length of one side?

A) 6m
B) 9m
C) 18m
D) 12m

Reasoning:","To find the length of one side of a square garden with a given perimeter, we need to divide the perimeter by the number of sides. In this case, the garden is a square, so it has 4 sides.

Perimeter (P) = 4 * Side (S)

Side (S) = Perimeter (P) / 4

Now, let's compute the side length:

Question: To fence a rectangular field 10m by 7m, how much fencing is needed?

A) 70m
B) 34m
C) 17m
D) 27m

Your thinking:","Alright, so I know that to find the perimeter of a rectangle, I need to add up the lengths of all its sides. I have the two lengths given: 10 meters for the long side and 7 meters for the short side.

My first instinct is to double the sum of the two lengths because I think the perimeter of a rectangle should include all sides twice (once for each side). So, I add 10 and 7 to get 17, and then double that to get 34 meters.

But wait! I just realized that includes the diagonal of the rectangle too, which isn't part of the perimeter. I should only add up the lengths of the four sides. So, I need to adjust my answer.

I subtract 2 from the total I got before (since a diagonal would be counted twice in that calculation) and divide by 2 because each side is counted only once in the correct perimeter calculation.

So, 34 - 2 = 32, and then divide by 2 to get 16. But that's not an option in the answers given. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back and double-check my steps.

Question: Which is larger: 0.5 or 0.25?

A) 0.25
B) 0.5

D) Cannot compare

Reasoning:","To solve this problem, we need to understand that when comparing decimals, we compare the number before the decimal point (whole numbers) and the number of digits after the decimal point (fractions). The larger the whole number or the larger the number of digits after the decimal point, the larger the decimal number.

A) 0.25
B) 0.5

D) Cannot compare

Reasoning:","To solve this problem, we need to compare the two decimal numbers.

The number that is larger will have a value greater than 0.50, and the decimal point will be after the larger number of places. For example, 0.51 is larger than 0.50 because the decimal point is after the 1.

Now, let's compare the given numbers:

0.25 is a decimal number where the decimal point is after the 5.
0.50 is a decimal number where the decimal point is after the 0.

Looking at the position of the decimal points, 0.50 is larger than 0.25 because the decimal point is after the larger number of places.

Now, I have 0.3 and 0.8 to compare. In this case, both numbers have 3 tenths, but 0.8 has 8 tenths, which is more than 3 tenths. So, 0.8 is larger than 0.3.

Now, I can order the numbers from smallest to largest:

0.15 (this is the smallest number)
0.3 (this is smaller than 0.8 but larger than 0.15)
0.8 (this is the largest number)

So, the answer should be D) 0.15, 0.3, 0.8. But remember, I'm just a model student, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Your thinking:","First, I need to understand that these are decimals. The numbers to the left of the decimal point tell me how many ""wholes"" there are, and the numbers to the right of the decimal point tell me how many parts of a whole there are.

With 0.3, there's 1 whole and 3 parts of a whole.
With 0.15, there's 1 whole and 15 parts of a whole (which is less than 3 parts).
With 0.8, there's 1 whole and 8 parts of a whole (which is more than 3 parts).

So, I think the numbers from smallest to largest should be:

0.15 < 0.3 (15 parts is less than 3 parts)
0.3 < 0.8 (3 parts is less than 8 parts)

First, I need to compare the numbers. I know that numbers with a decimal point to the right are bigger, and numbers with a decimal point to the left are smaller. So, I'll start by comparing the ones place (the numbers without the decimal points) and then check the tenths place (the decimal part).

0.3 has 3 in the ones place, and both 0.15 and 0.8 have 0 in the ones place. So, 0.3 is the smallest.

First, I know that numbers to the left of the decimal point are larger, so I look at the numbers to the left of the decimal point. In this case, there isn't anything to the left of the decimal point in either number, so we can't compare based on that.

Next, I remember that when comparing decimals, if the numbers to the left of the decimal point are the same, we look at the numbers to the right of the decimal point.

Question: 0.4 + 0.15 = ?

C) 1.9
D) 4.15

Your thinking:","Alright, let's do this!

First, I know that 0.4 is 4 tenths because the zero before the decimal point means nothing. Then, I know that 0.15 is 15 hundredths. Now, I need to add these two numbers.

To add tenths and hundredths, I need to make sure they have the same number of places. So, I'll change 0.15 into 0.15 (15 tenths).

Now, I see that 0.4 (4 tenths) + 0.15 (15 tenths) equals 0.59 (59 hundredths). But I only have 4 options to choose from, and 0.59 doesn't seem to be there.

I might have made a mistake somewhere, so let me double-check. I'll write down the process again:

1. Write down 0.4 (4 tenths) and 0.15 (15 hundredths).
2. Change 0.15 into 0.15 (15 tenths).
3. Add 0.4 and 0.15 to get 0.59.

Now, let me try moving 2 units up. When I do that, the y-coordinate increases (0 + 2 = 2), but the x-coordinate stays the same (0 + 0 = 0). That's not correct either, as the y-coordinate should be 5, not 2.

Next, you should do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 10 + 2 gives 12, and then 12 - 3 gives 9.

So, the answer is B) 9.

But wait! Let's double-check our BODMAS/PEDMAS rule. We should do the multiplication and division inside the addition and subtraction. In this case, there is no multiplication or division, but if there were, we would need to follow that rule.

Question: What is -8 - (-8)?

A) -16
B) 0
C) 16
D) 8

Reasoning:","To solve this problem, let's first understand the rules of parentheses and negation in mathematics:

1. Parentheses group terms together.
2. Negation (represented by the minus sign) changes the sign of a number.

Now, let's substitute the given expression into these rules:

-8 - (-8)

Since we have a negative number (-8) outside the parentheses, and we know that negation changes the sign, we can rewrite the expression inside the parentheses as follows:

-8 - (-(-8))

Now, we have two negation signs. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we should perform the negation inside the parentheses first:

-8 - (not -8)

Negation of a negative number results in a positive number:

-8 - 8

Now, we just need to subtract the numbers:

-8 - 8 = -16

C) 25
D) 55

Your thinking:","Alright, let's solve this problem.

First, I know that percent means ""out of 100"", so 25% means 25 out of 100. But the question asks for 25% of 80, not 100.

So, I need to find a way to make 80 part of 100. I can do this by using a sum where 80 and 20 (which is 100 - 80) are the parts.

Let's say A is 80 and B is 20. Then, the sum of A and B (100) equals 100. So, A/100 = 80/100 and B/100 = 20/100.

Now, I have two equations:

1) A/100 + B/100 = 1
2) A = 80

From equation 2, I can find the value of A, which is 80. Now, I can use this value in equation 1 to find the value of B.

A/100 + B/100 = 1, so (80/100) + B/100 = 1. This means that B/100 = 1 - (80/100), and then B = 100 * (1 - 80/100).

So, B = 100 * 20/100 = 20.

I have found that 20 is 25% of 80. However, the answer choices don't match my answer. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's double-check my calculations.

I see that I didn't consider that 25% means 25 out of the total, not 25 out of the parts. So, I need to find 25 out of 80, not 25 out of 100.

To do this, I can set up a ratio:

A:B = 80:25

Now, I can find the value of B by multip",B,"Alright, let's solve this problem.

From equation 2, I can find the value of A, which is 80. Now, I can use this value in equation 1 to find the value of B.

A/100 + B/100 = 1, so (80/100) + B/100 = 1. This means that B/100 = 1 - (80/100), and then B = 100 * (1 - 80/100).

So, B = 100 * 20/100 = 20.

Your thinking:","Alright, let's break it down. To find what percent 15 is of 60, I know I should divide 15 by 60 and then multiply by 100 because percent means ""per hundred.""

So, my first step is to divide 15 by 60:

15 ÷ 60 = 0.25

Now, I need to multiply this decimal by 100 to get the percent.

0.25 x 100 = 25

But wait, the options only have 4, 25, 40, and 15 as possible answers. I made a mistake when I calculated the percent. Let's try again, but this time, I'll remember to look at the options first.

When I look at the options, I notice that 15 is one of the choices, so it's worth a try to use it directly as a fraction of 60.

Let's see:

15 ÷ 60 = 15/60

I need to simplify this fraction to see if it's one of the percent options. To do that, I'll find the common factor of 15 and 60, which is 3.

So, 15/60 simplifies to 15/60 ÷ 3/3 = 15/60 × 3/3 = 5/20

Since 5/20 is not one of the options, I made another mistake. I should have started by checking the options first. I'll try one more time, using the correct approach this time.

When I look at the options, I notice that 25% seems to be the closest option to my calculations, so I'll give it a try.

To check if 25% is close to the correct answer, I'll divide 15 by 60 and multiply by 100, but this time, I'll round the answer to the nearest multiple of 5, since percentages are usually given as multiples of 5%.

So, 15 ÷ 60 x 100 ≈ 2",,"Alright, let's break it down. To find what percent 15 is of 60, I know I should divide 15 by 60 and then multiply by 100 because percent means ""per hundred.""

Question: 15 is what percent of 60?

A) 4%

C) 40%
D) 15%

Your thinking:","Alright, let's solve this problem. I know that percent means ""out of 100"", so I need to find out how many parts of 60 make up 15.

First, I'll set up the equation:

15 is ____% of 60

Then, I'll multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the percent:

15 * (%) = 60 * (1/100)

Next, I'll solve for the percent:

1. First, I know that the shirt originally costs $40.
2. Then, it's on sale for 20% off. I'm not sure how to calculate 20% of a number yet, but I know that when something is discounted, you subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price.
3. So, I need to find 20% of $40. I'm not sure how to do this, but I remember that percent means parts out of 100, so maybe I can think of $40 as 400 (since 1% is 1 out of 100, which is 0.01, so 20% would be 20 times that, or 20 times 0.01, which is 0.2).
4. But, I'm not sure if I can just multiply 0.2 by $40 to get the discount amount. Let's see, if I multiply 0.2 by 100 (to change it back to a percentage), I get 20, which seems like a lot more than $40.
5. I think I might have made a mistake in step 3. Let me try again. If 1% of $40 is $0.4, then 20% would be 20 times that, which is $8.
6. However, I'm not sure if this is correct because it seems too high. If I'm going to subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price, I should have a lower sale price than the original price, not the same or higher.

To find the percentage of students who are absent, we can use the formula:

Percentage = (Number of students absent / Total number of students) * 100%

But before we calculate the percentage, let's make sure we understand what the question is asking. The question asks for the percentage of students who are absent, not the percentage of seats that are empty.

So, let's calculate:

Percentage = (6 students absent / 30 students total) * 100%

Now we can do the multiplication:

Percentage = (6/30) * 100%

The next step is to divide the numbers:

Percentage = 0.2 * 100%

Now we can multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

Percentage = 20

But we need to express this as a percentage, so we append the ""%"" sign:

Percentage = 20%

First, we need to find out how many students are present in the class. Since there are 30 students in total and 6 are absent, that means 30 - 6 = 24 students are present.

Question: Simplify: 2x² + 3x

C) 5x²
D) 6x³

Reasoning:","To simplify the given expression, we don't have any operations like addition, subtraction, or multiplication of terms other than x and x², so there's no need to perform any calculations.

However, we can rewrite the expression in a different form if required. Since there is no constant term (a term without a variable), we cannot write it in the form of ax³ + bx² + cx + d as we would for a general polynomial.

But if we want to express it in terms of x², we can simply keep the terms that contain x², which are 2x² and 0x² (because there's no term without x²).

So, the simplified expression would be:

2x² + 0x (since there's no term without x²)

However, the given options don't include this simplification. Let's look at each option:

A) 5x³ - This is not correct because there's no x³ term in the original expression.

B) 2x² + 3x - This is the original expression, so it's not simplified.

Question: Simplify: 4a + 2b + 3a

A) 9ab
B) 7a + 2b
C) 7ab + 2
D) 4a + 5b

Your thinking:","Alright, let's simplify the expression 4a + 2b + 3a. I'll combine like terms, which means I'll add the 'a' terms together and the 'b' terms together.

So, I have:

4a (this is one group)
2b (another group)
3a (a third group)

Now, I'll combine the 'a' terms: 4a + 3a = 7a

And I'll leave the 'b' term as it is: 2b

But I realized I should also combine the 'a' and 'b' terms before I can truly simplify the expression. I can do this by multiplying the coefficients of the 'a' terms (4 and 3) and adding the coefficients of the 'b' term (0 and 2).

So, I have:

(4 * 3) + 0 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14

This means that each 'a' term contributes 14 to the simplified expression, and the 'b' term still contributes 2.

However, I noticed I made a mistake in my initial simplification. I should have combined the 'a' and 'b' terms before combining like terms.

So, I'll try again:

First, I'll combine the 'a' and 'b' terms: 4a + 2b becomes 4a + 2a + b

Then, I'll combine the 'a' terms: 4a + 2a + 3a = 9a

Your thinking:","At first, I don't know what ""simplified"" means in this context, but I can do the operation given for the variable.

So, for 5x + 3, I know that addition is just putting numbers together, but since there's only one number (5x) and an operation (plus) with another number (3), I don't see any way to simplify this.

The first term is just x. The second term, x * x, is x² (since x * x = x²).

The correct answer, considering the problem asks for simplification, is B) x + x² simplifies to 2x.",B,"To simplify the expression, we need to remember the distributive property, which states that when multiplying a sum by a multiplier, we can distribute the multiplier to each term in the sum.

So, in this case: x + x² = x * 1 (since 1 is the multiplier for x) + x * x (since x * x means squaring x).

The first term is just x. The second term, x * x, is x² (since x * x = x²).

So, x + x² = x + x² (which seems repetitive, but they are different instances of x * 1 and x * x). However, we can combine the terms because they are equal, giving us:

x + x² = 2x

Question: Simplify: x + x²

Your thinking:","Alright, let's solve this step by step.

I know that when you square a number, you multiply it by itself. So, if x is multiplied by x (x²), that's just x^2.

Now, I have x + x² (which is x + the square of x).

But in this problem, I'm supposed to simplify it, and it looks like I already have the simplified form. So, I guess the answer is B) x + x².

However, when I look at the options, they all seem different from what I got. I think I made a mistake somewhere. Let's think again...

Okay, I see it now. I need to combine the x terms. If I add x and x (since x squared is not an x term), I get 2x.

So, the simplified form should be 2x, not x + x².

Final answer: C) 2x (but I made a mistake, it should have been 2x instead of x + x²).",C,"Alright, let's solve this step by step.

Question: Simplify: x + x²

A) x³
B) x + x²

D) 2x³

Your thinking:","Alright, let's break this down. I know that when you multiply a number by itself, you get the square of that number. So, if I have x times x, that's x² already.

Now, I have x + x². I need to get rid of the x² in the addition part. I can do that by moving x² to the other side of the equation and changing the sign. So, it becomes x - x².

But wait, when I subtract x² from x, I'm actually subtracting the square of a number from the number itself. I'm not sure if that's allowed, but let's see what happens.

So, now I have x - x² = x - x + x² = 2x. But the options don't have 2x, they have 2x² instead. I think I might have made a mistake somewhere, but I'm not sure where. I'll have to ask my teacher about this.

Question: Simplify: x + x²

A) x³
B) x + x²
C) 2x²
D) 2x³

Your thinking:","Alright, let's simplify the expression x + x^2.

I know that if you square a variable, you multiply it by itself. So, when I see x^2, I think of it as x * x.

But when I'm adding x and x * x, I'm not sure how to combine them. I think I can distribute the addition, but I'm not sure if I should do it like this:

x + x * x = x + x^2 + x

Or maybe I should do it like this:

x + x^2 + x = 2x + x^2

But that doesn't seem right because it looks like I added x twice.

So, I'll try another approach:

I know that adding the same number multiple times doesn't change the value of the expression, so maybe I can just combine the x's and the x^2's:

x + x^2 = x + x*x = x*1 + x*x = x(1 + x)

But that doesn't seem to be one of the given answers.

I'm not sure what to do next, so I'll ask my teacher for help or double-check the answers.
