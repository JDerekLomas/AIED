Note: In many Indian government schools, students often struggle with English as a medium of instruction and frequently mix up concepts or use "rote-learned" phrases even if they don't fully apply.

**Student 1 (basic):** 
(a) Almunium 
(b) because if heat come tracks will grow.
(c) Copper is good wire.

**Student 2 (basic):** 
(a) Alumminum
(b) Because tracks expand in summer. Gaps prevent accident.
(c) Copper because it is good conductor.

**Student 3 (struggling):** 
(a) Iron
(b) For train to run.
(c) Iron wire.

**Student 4 (advanced):** 
(a) Aluminum expands the most.
(b) Gaps are left for thermal expansion. In summer, tracks expand due to heat; if no gap is left, the tracks will bend (buckle) and cause accidents.
(c) Copper. It is a very good conductor of electricity and has low resistance.

**Student 5 (basic):** 
(a) Alumnium
(b) Due to heat expansion.
(c) Copper wire because electricity flows.

**Student 6 (basic):** 
(a) Aluminyum 
(b) To stop track from breaking in hot sun.
(c) Copper metal.

**Student 7 (struggling):** 
(a) Metal
(b) Gaps are for air.
(c) [Left Blank]

**Student 8 (struggling):** 
(a) 100 degree
(b) train wheels need space.
(c) Silver.

**Student 9 (competent):** 
(a) Aluminium 
(b) Tracks expand in summer heat. Gaps are left so that they have space to expand without bending. 
(c) Copper metal because it is cheap and good conductor of current.

**Student 10 (competent):** 
(a) Aluminium
(b) Because of thermal expansion in summer seasons.
(c) Copper is recommended because it conducts electricity easily.

**Student 11 (advanced):** 
(a) Aluminum (from the given table).
(b) In summers, iron tracks expand due to heat. Gaps are left to allow this expansion, otherwise the tracks will warp and derail the train.
(c) Copper is best for wires because it has high conductivity and is ductile.

**Student 12 (struggling):** 
(a) Iron
(b) Gap for safety.
(c) [Scrawled drawing of a wire]

**Student 13 (competent):** 
(a) Aluminum
(b) Gaps are provided for expansion of tracks during hot weather. 
(c) Copper because it is a very good conductor.

**Student 14 (basic):** 
(a) Aliminium 
(b) To save tracks from bending. 
(c) Copper wire.

**Student 15 (basic):** 
(a) Alluminum
(b) Summer heat makes tracks long. 
(c) Copper.

**Student 16 (basic):** 
(a) Aluminium
(b) Gaps prevent the railway line from cracking. 
(c) Gold metal.

**Student 17 (competent):** 
(a) Aluminum
(b) Gaps are left because solids expand on heating. It prevents railway tracks from bending in summer.
(c) Copper metal because it is cheaper than silver and a great conductor.

**Student 18 (struggling):** 
(a) Table
(b) Gap is for repair.
(c) Steel.

**Student 19 (struggling):** 
(a) heating
(b) because of heat and light.
(c) Iron metal.

**Student 20 (competent):** 
(a) Aluminium
(b) Gaps are left for expansion. In heat, the metal expands and fills the gap. If no gap, the track will buckle.
(c) Copper is recommended because it is a good conductor of electricity.
