**Student 1 (struggling):** 300 - 80 = 220 choclate.

**Student 2 (basic):** 80 students and 300 chocolate. 300/80 = 3 chocolate each and 60 left. 20 more needed. Class get 10 students each class.

**Student 3 (advanced):** Total students = 80. Each should get equal. Next multiple of 80 after 300 is 80 x 4 = 320. So 320 - 300 = 20 chocolates required. Total classes = 8. Students per class = 80/8 = 10. Each student gets 4, so each class gets 10 x 4 = 40 chocolates.

**Student 4 (basic):** 300 divide by 80. 300 is not coming in 8 table. 320 comes. So 20 more chocolate. Class get 40.

**Student 5 (struggling):** 300 chocolate. 80 student. 8 classes. Each class 100. 

**Student 6 (competent):** Total student = 80. Each get 4 chocolate = 320. Extra needed = 320 - 300 = 20 chocolates. 
80 / 8 classes = 10 student in each class. 
Chocolates for 1 class = 10 x 4 = 40 chocolates.

**Student 7 (struggling):** [Blank]

**Student 8 (basic):** 80 x 4 = 320. Minmum 20 chocolate more. Total 80 student / 8 class = 10. 

**Student 9 (basic):** 300 / 80 = remainder is 60. So need 20 more for 80. Ans: 20 chocolates. Each class get 30.

**Student 10 (competent):** 80 students need 320 chocolates to have 4 each. So 20 more required.
Each class has 10 students. 
Each class gets 10 x 4 = 40 chocolates.

**Student 11 (competent):** For equal distribution, 320 is needed (80 x 4). Extra = 20 chocolates. 
8 classes means 10 students per class.
Each class gets 40 chocolates.

**Student 12 (struggling):** 80 + 8 = 88. 300 total. 

**Student 13 (basic):** 20 choclate need. Total class is 8. 320/8 = 40. Each class get 40 choclates.

**Student 14 (advanced):** To distribute equally, the total number of chocolates must be a multiple of 80. The nearest multiple greater than 300 is 320. 
Min chocolates required = 320 - 300 = 20.
Number of students per class = 80 / 8 = 10.
Chocolates per class = 10 students × 4 chocolates = 40 chocolates.

**Student 15 (basic):** 80 stusents. 320-300 = 20 extra. 8 classes get 40-40 choclets.

**Student 16 (competent):** 80 x 4 = 320. 
Requirement = 20 more chocolates.
Students in 1 class = 80/8 = 10.
Each class will get 10 x 4 = 40.

**Student 17 (struggling):** 80 divide 300 = 3.6. 20 needed. 8 classes get 300.

**Student 18 (struggling):** School has 80. 300 choklate. 8 classes. [Scrawled drawing of a chocolate bar]

**Student 19 (competent):** 80 x 3 = 240, 80 x 4 = 320.
Min chocolates required = 20.
Students per class = 80 / 8 = 10.
Chocolates for each class = 10 x 4 = 40.

**Student 20 (basic):** 300 + 20 = 320. Ans is 20 choclates. Each class get 10 students and 40 choclates.
