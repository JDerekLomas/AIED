Student 1 (struggling): 112 + 10 = 122 pensils

Student 2 (basic): 112 / 10. Each box 11 pensil. Remaning 2.

Student 3 (basic): total 112. 10 box. 11 pencil in 1 box. 

Student 4 (basic): Each box have 11. Minimum 8 more need. 

Student 5 (advanced): Total pencils = 112. Boxes = 10. To make it equal, we need 120 pencils because 120 is divisible by 10. So minimum pencils required is 120 - 112 = 8 more. Each box will have 12 pencils.

Student 6 (struggling): 112 pencils 10 box. ans = 100.

Student 7 (basic): divide 112 by 10. Remainder is 2. So 8 more pencils. Each box 12.

Student 8 (competent): 112 / 10 = 11 pensils each. 2 left. To make it equal, add 8. So 120/10 = 12. Ans: 8 pencils needed. Each box has 12.

Student 9 (competent): 112 divide 10 = 11 (Quotient), 2 (Remainder). Minimum pencils needed to add = 10 - 2 = 8. Each box = 12 pencils.

Student 10 (advanced): Given: 112 pencils, 10 boxes. For equal distribution, 112 must be multiple of 10. Next multiple is 120. Pencils required = 120 - 112 = 8. Pencils in each box = 120/10 = 12.

Student 11 (basic): 120 - 112 = 8. Answer 12 pencils.

Student 12 (struggling): 112
- 10
-----
102

Student 13 (competent): To make equal in 10 boxes, we need 120 pencils. Total extra pencils = 8. Pencils in each box = 12.

Student 14 (struggling): [blank]

Student 15 (competent): 112 pencils / 10 boxes = 11 pencils in each box and 2 remaining. So 8 more pencils required to make 12 in each box.

Student 16 (struggling): box = 10. pencil = 112. each box 10.

Student 17 (competent): For equal boxes, we need 120 pencils. Required = 8 pencils. Each box = 12.

Student 18 (basic): 112/10. Quotient 11, Remainder 2. We need 8 more. Total 12.

Student 19 (struggling): 112 box and 10 pensil total 1120.

Student 20 (basic): 8 more pencils. Each box 12 pencil.
