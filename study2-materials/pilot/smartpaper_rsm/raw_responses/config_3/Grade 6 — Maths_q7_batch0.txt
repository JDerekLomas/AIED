Student 1 (competent): 10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours. Increase = 6 x 2 = 12. Total temperature = 30 + 12 = 42 degree C.

Student 2 (basic): 10 to 4 is 6 hours. 2+2+2+2+2+2 = 12. 30 + 12 = 42 C.

Student 3 (struggling): 30 + 2 + 4 = 36 degree.

Student 4 (competent): Time gap = 6 hours. Temperature rise = 6 * 2 = 12. Final temp = 30 + 12 = 42°C.

Student 5 (basic): 11am-32, 12pm-34, 1pm-36, 2pm-38, 3pm-40, 4pm-42. Ans: 42.

Student 6 (basic): 10 am to 4 pm is 6 hours. 6 multiply 2 is 12. 30+12 = 42.

Student 7 (struggling): 30 + 10 + 4 = 44 C.

Student 8 (basic): 30 degree + 12 degree = 42 degree celcius.

Student 9 (competent): Temperature at 10 am = 30. Total hours = 6. Increase = 6 x 2 = 12. At 4 pm = 30 + 12 = 42°C.

Student 10 (basic): 42 C.

Student 11 (struggling): 32 degree.

Student 12 (struggling): [Left Blank]

Student 13 (struggling): Jodhpur temperature is 30. evening 4. 30 + 4 = 34.

Student 14 (basic): 10 to 4 = 6. 6 x 2 = 12. 30 + 12 = 42.

Student 15 (competent): Initial temp = 30°C. Time = 6 hours. Increase = 6 x 2 = 12°C. Total = 30 + 12 = 42°C.

Student 16 (advanced): Temp at 10:00 = 30°C. Duration (10:00 to 16:00) = 6 hours. Rate of increase = 2°C/hr. Total increase = 6 × 2 = 12°C. Final temperature = 30°C + 12°C = 42°C.

Student 17 (competent): 42 degree Celsius because 6 hours multiply by 2 is 12 and 30 plus 12 is 42.

Student 18 (advanced): Time elapsed from 10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours. Since temp rises 2°C every hour, total rise = 6 x 2 = 12°C. Therefore, temp at 4 pm = 30°C + 12°C = 42°C.

Student 19 (basic): 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4. (6 hours). 30+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 42.

Student 20 (struggling): 10 + 30 + 2 + 4 = 46.
