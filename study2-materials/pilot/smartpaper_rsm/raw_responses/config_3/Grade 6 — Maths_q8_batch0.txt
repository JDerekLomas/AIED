Student 1 (struggling): 15 + 8 = 23 cm

Student 2 (basic): Area = 15 x 8 = 120. Perimeter = 15 + 8 + 15 + 8 = 46.

Student 3 (basic): L = 15, B = 8. Area is 120 cm. Perimeter is 46 cm.

Student 4 (basic): Area = 120 sq cm, Perimiter = 46 cm

Student 5 (basic): 120 and 46

Student 6 (competent): Area of rectangle = l × b = 15 × 8 = 120 sq cm. Perimeter = 2(l + b) = 2(15 + 8) = 2(23) = 46 cm.

Student 7 (basic): Area = 15 × 8 = 110. Perimeter = 46.

Student 8 (struggling): 158 cm

Student 9 (advanced): Length (l) = 15 cm, Breadth (b) = 8 cm. Area = l × b = 15 × 8 = 120 cm². Perimeter = 2(l + b) = 2(15 + 8) = 2 × 23 = 46 cm.

Student 10 (basic): area - 120cm, perameter - 46cm

Student 11 (struggling): [Blank]

Student 12 (competent): Area = 120 sq.cm. Perimeter = 2(15+8) = 46 cm.

Student 13 (struggling): 15 + 8 + 15 + 8 = 36 cm.

Student 14 (basic): Area = 120. Perimeter = 46.

Student 15 (competent): Area = L x B = 15 x 8 = 120 cm^2. Perimeter = 2(L+B) = 46 cm.

Student 16 (competent): L=15cm, B=8cm. Area=120 sq cm. Perimeter=46 cm.

Student 17 (advanced): Given: l = 15 cm, b = 8 cm. Area = l × b = 15 × 8 = 120 cm². Perimeter = 2(l + b) = 2(15 + 8) = 2(23) = 46 cm.

Student 18 (competent): Area = 15*8 = 120 sq.cm. Peri = 46 cm.

Student 19 (struggling): 15 mulitply 8 = 100.

Student 20 (struggling): rectangle is 15 8. total 23.
