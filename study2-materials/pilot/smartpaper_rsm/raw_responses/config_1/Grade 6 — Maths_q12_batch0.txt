Student 1 (basic): Total pencil = 112. Box = 10. 112 / 10 = 11. 2 pencil left. 8 more pencil needed. Each box 12 pencil.

Student 2 (competent): Total pencils = 112. Boxes = 10. To make it equal, we need 120 pencils. So 120 - 112 = 8 pencils required. Each box will have 12 pencils.

Student 3 (basic): 112 pencils. 10 box. 112 + 8 = 120. 8 pencil needed. Each box 12.

Student 4 (competent): No. of pencils = 112. No. of boxes = 10. For equal distribution, 112 / 10 gives remainder 2. Next multiple of 10 is 120. Pencils needed = 8. Pencils in each box = 12.

Student 5 (struggling): 112 - 10 = 102 pencils.

Student 6 (basic): 112 divide by 10. 11 pencil in each box. 2 is left. 8 more pencils.

Student 7 (struggling): 11210 pencils.

Student 8 (advanced): Total pencils = 112. Number of boxes = 10. To have an equal number of pencils in each box without any left over, the total must be divisible by 10. The next multiple of 10 after 112 is 120. 
1) Minimum pencils required = 120 - 112 = 8 pencils.
2) Pencils in each box = 120 / 10 = 12 pencils.

Student 9 (struggling): [Left Blank]

Student 10 (struggling): 112 + 10 = 122.

Student 11 (basic): 10 x 11 = 110. 10 x 12 = 120. We need 8 more pencils. Each box 12 pencils.

Student 12 (advanced): Given: 112 pencils, 10 boxes. 
To find the minimum pencils to add: 10 - (112 mod 10) = 10 - 2 = 8 pencils.
Total pencils = 112 + 8 = 120.
Pencils per box = 120 / 10 = 12.
Ans: 8 pencils needed, 12 in each box.

Student 13 (struggling): 112 pencils in 10 box. 112.

Student 14 (basic): 112 / 10. Remainder is 2. So 8 more pencils needed to make it 120. 12 pencils in each box.

Student 15 (struggling): 10 boxes 112 pencils. 1120.

Student 16 (competent): 112 pencils and 10 boxes. 112 is not in 10 table. 120 is in 10 table. So 8 pencils more needed. Each box will have 12 pencils.

Student 17 (competent): To put equal pencils in 10 boxes, total should be 120. 
Extra pencils needed = 120 - 112 = 8.
Pencils in each box = 12.

Student 18 (basic): 112 + 8 = 120. 8 pencils needed. 12 pencils in each box.

Student 19 (competent): Total pencils = 112. Boxes = 10. 
112 / 10 = 11 pencils and 2 left. 
To make it equal we need 12 in each. 
12 x 10 = 120. 
120 - 112 = 8 pencils required.

Student 20 (basic): 112 / 10 = 11.2. So 12 pencils. 8 pencils needed.
