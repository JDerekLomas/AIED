**Student 1 (struggling):** 300 + 80 = 380 choclate.

**Student 2 (advanced):** Total students = 80. To distribute equally, each student gets at least 3 chocolates (80 x 3 = 240). If we give 4 each, we need 320. So minimum chocolates required = 320. 
Total classes = 8. Students per class = 80/8 = 10.
Chocolates per class = 10 x 4 = 40 chocolates.

**Student 3 (basic):** 80 students. 300/80. 3 chocolates each. 60 left. 
Each class gets 300/8 = 37.5.

**Student 4 (basic):** 80 x 4 = 320. We need 20 more chocolates. 
Each class has 10 students. 10 x 3 = 30 chocolates.

**Student 5 (basic):** 300 / 80 = 3.75. 
Each class get 300 / 8 = 37.5 choclates.

**Student 6 (struggling):** 80 students 8 class. 80 - 8 = 72.

**Student 7 (competent):** To give equal chocolates, 80 x 4 = 320. So 320 chocolates are required.
Each class has 80/8 = 10 students.
Each class gets 320 / 8 = 40 chocolates.

**Student 8 (struggling):** [Blank]

**Student 9 (struggling):** 300 choklate. 80 student. 300 - 80 = 220.

**Student 10 (struggling):** 80 + 8 = 88.

**Student 11 (advanced):** For equal distribution, we need a multiple of 80. The next multiple after 300 is 80 x 4 = 320. 
Minimum chocolates = 320.
Number of students per class = 80 / 8 = 10.
Chocolates per class = 320 / 8 = 40 chocolates.

**Student 12 (struggling):** 300/80 = 3.

**Student 13 (basic):** 80 students. 300 is not divide by 80. So 320 choclates.
8 classes. 320 / 8 = 40. Each class get 40.

**Student 14 (competent):** 80 x 4 = 320. Minimum 320 chocolates needed.
80 students / 8 classes = 10 students per class.
10 x 4 = 40 chocolates for each class.

**Student 15 (basic):** 300 / 80. Remainder is 60. 
Each class gets 300 / 8 = 37 choclates.

**Student 16 (competent):** Total students = 80. For equal distribution, we need 320 chocolates (4 per student).
Total classes = 8.
Chocolates per class = 320 / 8 = 40.

**Student 17 (competent):** 80 students need 320 chocolates to get 4 each. 
Each class has 10 students. 
10 students x 4 chocolates = 40 chocolates per class.

**Student 18 (basic):** 300 / 80 = 3 choclates each. 
Each class = 300 / 8 = 37.5.

**Student 19 (basic):** 80 * 4 = 320. 
320 / 8 = 40. Each class get 40.

**Student 20 (competent):** Minimum chocolates = 320 (so everyone gets 4).
Students per class = 80 / 8 = 10.
Chocolates per class = 320 / 8 = 40.
