Student 1 (struggling): 15 + 8 = 23 cm

Student 2 (competent): Area = L x B = 15 x 8 = 120 sq cm. Perimeter = 2(L+B) = 2(15+8) = 2(23) = 46 cm.

Student 3 (struggling): [Blank]

Student 4 (advanced): Given: Length = 15 cm, Breadth = 8 cm.
Area of rectangle = l × b = 15 × 8 = 120 cm²
Perimeter of rectangle = 2(l + b) = 2(15 + 8) = 2 × 23 = 46 cm.

Student 5 (basic): Area is 120. Perimter is 46.

Student 6 (competent): Area = 15 * 8 = 120 sq cm. Perimeter = 15+15+8+8 = 46 cm.

Student 7 (struggling): 15 multiply 8 = 110

Student 8 (basic): Area = 15 x 8 = 120 cm. Perimeter = 15 + 8 = 23 cm.

Student 9 (advanced): Length (l) = 15 cm, Breadth (b) = 8 cm
Area = l × b = 15 cm × 8 cm = 120 sq.cm
Perimeter = 2(l + b) = 2(15 + 8) = 2(23) = 46 cm

Student 10 (basic): Area = 120 cm, Perimeter = 46 cm

Student 11 (basic): 15 x 8 = 120 (Area). 15+15+8+8 = 46 (Perimeter).

Student 12 (struggling): rectangle = 158 cm

Student 13 (struggling): 15 + 8 + 15 + 8 = 46. Area = ?

Student 14 (basic): Area = 15 x 8 = 120 sq cm. Perimiter = 36 cm.

Student 15 (basic): Area = 120. Perimeter = 46.

Student 16 (competent): Area = L x B = 15 x 8 = 120 sq cm. Perimeter = 2(15+8) = 46 cm.

Student 17 (competent): Area of rectangle = 15 x 8 = 120 cm². Perimeter = 2(15+8) = 46 cm.

Student 18 (struggling): 15 - 8 = 7 cm

Student 19 (basic): Area = 120 cm. Perimeter = 46 cm.

Student 20 (competent): L=15, B=8. Area = 15x8 = 120 sq cm. Perimeter = 2(15+8) = 46 cm.
