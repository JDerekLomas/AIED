Student 1 (competent): 10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours. Increase = 6 x 2 = 12. Total temperature = 30 + 12 = 42°C.

Student 2 (basic): 10 to 4 is 6 hours. 2+2+2+2+2+2 = 12. 30 + 12 = 42 degree.

Student 3 (advanced): Time duration from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM = 6 hours.
Rate of increase = 2°C/hour.
Total increase = 6 × 2 = 12°C.
Final temperature = 30°C + 12°C = 42°C.

Student 4 (competent): 10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours. 6 * 2 = 12. 30 + 12 = 42 C.

Student 5 (competent): 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4. Total 6 hours. 6 x 2 = 12. Answer is 30 + 12 = 42 degree Celcius.

Student 6 (struggling): 30 + 2 + 4 = 36 degree.

Student 7 (struggling): 30 + 2 = 32 C.

Student 8 (advanced): Initial Temp = 30°C (10 AM).
Time elapsed until 4 PM = 6 hours.
Temperature rise = 6 hours × 2°C/hr = 12°C.
Temperature at 4 PM = 30°C + 12°C = 42°C.

Student 9 (struggling): [Blank]

Student 10 (struggling): 10 + 4 = 14. 30 + 14 = 44.

Student 11 (competent): 6 hours x 2 degree = 12 degree. 30 + 12 = 42°C.

Student 12 (competent): 10 am to 4 pm is 6 hours. 6 x 2 = 12. Temp will be 42°C.

Student 13 (basic): 11am-32, 12pm-34, 1pm-36, 2pm-38, 3pm-40, 4pm-42. Ans: 42.

Student 14 (basic): 30 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 42 degree C.

Student 15 (basic): 10 to 4 is 6 hours. 6 multiply 2 is 12. 30 + 12 = 42.

Student 16 (struggling): Jodhpur temperature is 30 + 10 + 4 = 44.

Student 17 (basic): 6 hours gap. 6 x 2 = 12. 30 + 12 = 42.

Student 18 (basic): 30 + 12 = 42 degree.

Student 19 (struggling): 30 degree + 2 degree = 32 degree.

Student 20 (basic): 10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours. 6 x 2 = 12. 30 + 12 = 42.
