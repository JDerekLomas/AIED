**Student 1 (basic):** (a) Gas (b) Because of heat. (c) Copper because it is good.

**Student 2 (advanced):** (a) According to the table, gases expand the most. (b) Gaps are left between railway tracks to allow for thermal expansion during summer. Without gaps, the tracks would bend or buckle. (c) Copper metal, because it is a very good conductor of electricity and is flexible.

**Student 3 (basic):** (a) Aluminium (b) For safety. (c) Iron wire because it is strong.

**Student 4 (competent):** (a) Gas expands most. (b) In summer tracks get hot and expand. If no gap is there, they will break. (c) Copper because it conducts electricity well.

**Student 5 (basic):** (a) Liquid (b) To stop accident. (c) Copper wire.

**Student 6 (competent):** (a) Gas. (b) Gaps are left because metals expand on heating. The gap gives space for expansion in summer. (c) Copper, because it has low resistance.

**Student 7 (struggling):** (a) Iron (b) train will run (c) steel

**Student 8 (struggling):** (a) water (b) [blank] (c) plastic

**Student 9 (advanced):** (a) Gases show maximum expansion on heating. (b) Railway tracks are made of steel which expands when temperature rises. Gaps prevent the rails from warping or deforming. (c) Copper is recommended because it is a superior conductor and more ductile than other common metals.

**Student 10 (basic):** (a) Gas (b) Because it becomes hot in sun. (c) Copper is best.

**Student 11 (basic):** (a) Air (b) To save the track from bending. (c) Gold metal.

**Student 12 (struggling):** (a) 100 (b) gap is for wheels (c) silver

**Student 13 (competent):** (a) Gas expands the most. (b) Metals expand when heated. Gaps are left so tracks don't bend in summer heat. (c) Copper because it is a good conductor of electricity.

**Student 14 (competent):** (a) Gas. (b) Due to thermal expansion, the tracks increase in length. Gaps provide space. (c) Copper metal because it allows current to flow easily.

**Student 15 (struggling):** (a) Solid (b) [blank] (c) Iron

**Student 16 (struggling):** (a) heating (b) for the train (c) wire

**Student 17 (basic):** (a) Gas (b) Because of expansion. (c) Copper because it is cheap and good.

**Student 18 (competent):** (a) Gases. (b) Gaps are left for expansion of the iron rails during hot weather. (c) Copper, because it is a very good conductor.

**Student 19 (basic):** (a) Gas (b) To prevent bending of tracks. (c) Copper.

**Student 20 (struggling):** (a) Table (b) No answer (c) Copper metal.
