Student 1 (competent): The property of metals to be beaten into thin sheets is called Malleability.

Student 2 (basic): It is called Maleability.

Student 3 (competent): Malleability is the property that allows metals to be beaten into thin sheets.

Student 4 (advanced): This property is known as malleability. Because of this, metals like aluminium can be converted into thin foils without breaking.

Student 5 (basic): Malebility.

Student 6 (basic): malleablity

Student 7 (basic): It is called Maliability.

Student 8 (struggling): Hardness of metal.

Student 9 (struggling): [blank]

Student 10 (struggling): aluminium foil is used for food.

Student 11 (struggling): Ductility

Student 12 (competent): The property is Malleability.

Student 13 (basic): maleable

Student 14 (basic): Malleablity

Student 15 (competent): Malleability.

Student 16 (struggling): beating metal

Student 17 (basic): Maleability

Student 18 (advanced): The property of metals by which they can be beaten into thin sheets is called malleability. For example, silver and aluminium foils.

Student 19 (struggling): Good conductor

Student 20 (competent): Malleability is the property of metals to make thin sheets.
