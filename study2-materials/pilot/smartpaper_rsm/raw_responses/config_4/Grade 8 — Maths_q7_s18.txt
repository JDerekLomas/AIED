To distribute chocolates equally among 80 students using the 300 chocolates available, the minimum number required for a fair distribution is **80 chocolates** (1 for each student). 

If there are 8 classes with an equal number of students, each class has 10 students ($80 \div 8 = 10$). Therefore, if each student gets one chocolate, each class gets **10 chocolates**.
