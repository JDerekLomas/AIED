To distribute chocolates equally among 80 students, each student must get at least 1 chocolate, so the minimum number required is **80 chocolates**. 

Since there are 8 classes with an equal number of students, each class has 10 students (80 ÷ 8 = 10). If the 300 chocolates are distributed equally among the 80 students, each student gets 3 chocolates (with 60 left over). Therefore, each class gets **30 chocolates**.
