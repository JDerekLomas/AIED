<explanation>The most common error is the fundamental misconception that "a negative and a negative make a negative." Students often see the minus signs in the question and result (-24) and assume the arithmetic is correct without applying the rule that the product or quotient of two negatives must be positive. Option C is the most frequent wrong answer because the diagram visually supports the "size" of the numbers (3 lots of 8 make 24), leading students to validate both calculations based on the digits alone while ignoring the sign laws. Lower year groups struggle more as they are still transitioning from concrete arithmetic to abstract directed number rules.</explanation>
