<explanation>The most common error is failing to correctly multiply two negative numbers. Students often correctly multiply the first term (-3 * m = -3m) but then see the minus sign in the bracket and either 'bring it down' or apply the rule that 'a negative and a negative make a negative', leading to -3m - 6 (Option B). Some students also struggle with the initial term's sign or forget to multiply the second term entirely, but the sign error on the constant term is the most persistent misconception across all Key Stages.</explanation>
