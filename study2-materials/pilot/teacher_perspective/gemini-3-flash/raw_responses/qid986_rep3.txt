<explanation>Students frequently struggle with the 'order of operations' in reverse when solving equations. Tom's error is a classic 'floating term' mistake; students see -6 and +6, ignoring the fact that the entire expression is divided by 2. Katie's error is the specific misconception identified: she sees a division by 2 and performs another division (10 ÷ 2 = 5) rather than the inverse operation (multiplication). Many students will select 'Both' because they recognise the numbers 16 (10+6) and 5 (10/2) as 'maths-related' results of the numbers in the equation, failing to verify the logic of the steps.</explanation>
