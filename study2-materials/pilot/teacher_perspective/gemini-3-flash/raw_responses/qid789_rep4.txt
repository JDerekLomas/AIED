<explanation>There are two distinct hurdles in this question. The first is the conceptual addition: many lower-ability students will choose A (8/20) because they apply the 'add across' intuition to both numerators and denominators. However, among those who understand that the denominator remains the same (choosing 8/10), a significant proportion across all year groups will fail to "Write your answer in its simplest form." Therefore, Option B is the most common pitfall. Even in Year 11, under exam pressure, students frequently forget the final simplification step or perform it incorrectly (leading to Option D if they only divide the numerator).</explanation>
