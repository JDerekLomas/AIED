<explanation>The most common error is failing to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly. Students often read the expression from left to right, performing -4 + (-5) first to get -9, then multiplying by 3 to reach -27 (Option B). This is a "double-hurdle" question: it tests both the priority of operations (multiplication before addition) and directed number arithmetic. Even students who remember the order of operations often struggle with the signed number arithmetic, specifically the addition of two negatives or the multiplication of a negative and a positive. Option C is a common "accidental" answer where students do -4 + (-5) + 3 or make a calculation error in the multiplication.</explanation>
