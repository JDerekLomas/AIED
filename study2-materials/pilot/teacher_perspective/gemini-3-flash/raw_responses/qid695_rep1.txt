<explanation>The most common error is calculating strictly from left to right (18 ÷ 2 = 9, then 9 + 2 = 11, then 11 × 2 = 22), leading to option C. Students often view the equals sign as a prompt to perform operations in the order they appear. Even students who know the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS often mistakenly believe that Addition must come before Multiplication because 'A' precedes 'M' in the acronym, which would lead to 18 ÷ (2 + 2) × 2, though this is less common than simple left-to-right processing. Option A is a result of adding first then dividing the total, while D is a calculation slip.</explanation>
