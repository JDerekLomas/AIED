<explanation>The primary misconception is the 'sign rule' for multiplication. Many students, particularly in lower years, remember that a negative is involved but incorrectly apply the logic that 'negative plus negative equals negative' to multiplication, leading them to choose A (-3 x -8 = -24). Option C is a common error for students who confuse 'product' with 'sum', while Option D is a simple calculation error. The 'two negatives make a positive' rule is one of the most frequently misapplied concepts in KS3 and KS4 algebra and number work.</explanation>
