<explanation>The most common error is Option A, driven by a 'left-to-right' reading habit. Many students see '2 ÷ 3' and immediately write it as a fraction, then simply append '+ ab', failing to recognise that the entire expression within the brackets must form the denominator. Additionally, some students choose D because they do not yet fully internalise that the 'hidden' multiplication sign is a formal convention, while others struggle with the commutative property of addition, not realising that 3 + ab is identical to ab + 3.</explanation>
