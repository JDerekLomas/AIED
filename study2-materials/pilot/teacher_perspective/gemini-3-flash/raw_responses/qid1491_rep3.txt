<explanation>The primary error is a confusion between the rules for multiplying negatives and the notation of indices. Many students associate a negative base with a negative result regardless of the exponent (Option A). This is exacerbated by the "calculator error" where typing -2^4 without brackets yields -16, leading students to believe that is the mathematically correct definition. Lower ability students frequently default to multiplication (Option B or D), treating the exponent as a multiplier (e.g., -2 * 4 = -8).</explanation>
