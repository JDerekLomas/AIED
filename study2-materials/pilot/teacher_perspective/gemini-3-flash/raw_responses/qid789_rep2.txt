<explanation>The high incorrect rate is driven by a "two-step" hurdle. While many students avoid the classic mistake of adding denominators (Option A), a significant majority across all year groups fail to "Write your answer in its simplest form." Year 7s and 8s are most likely to choose A due to the intuitive but incorrect additive strategy. Older students (Years 9-11) generally know to keep the denominator the same, but frequently stop at 8/10 (Option B), either through haste or a lack of fluency in simplifying fractions. Option B is the most common distractor because it feels 'correct' as the immediate result of the calculation.</explanation>
