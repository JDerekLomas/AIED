<explanation>The most common error is the "left-to-right" bias (Option B). Students often view mathematics as a narrative that must be read from left to right, assuming that the sequence of numbers dictates the order of operations. Even when students know the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym, many struggle to apply it when a subtraction or addition appears at the start of the expression. A smaller subset of students choose Option A due to the common misconception that 'Addition' must always come before 'Subtraction' because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, though Option B remains the dominant intuitive error across all Key Stage 3 and 4 year groups.</explanation>
