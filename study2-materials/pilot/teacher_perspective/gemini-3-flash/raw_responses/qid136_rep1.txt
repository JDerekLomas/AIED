<explanation>The primary misconception is the 'sign rule' for multiplication. Many students, particularly in lower years, remember that a negative must be involved to get a negative answer, but they incorrectly apply the logic that "two negatives make a negative" (often confusing it with addition rules like -3 + -8 = -11). Option A is the most common distractor because students see two negatives and the correct absolute product (24), but fail to realise that (-3) × (-8) = +24. Option C is a common error for students who confuse 'product' with 'sum'.</explanation>
