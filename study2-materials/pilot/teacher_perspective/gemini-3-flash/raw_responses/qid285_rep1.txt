<explanation>Students frequently struggle with the 'order of operations' in reverse when rearranging. The most common error (Option A) stems from two specific misconceptions: 1) failing to recognize that 'r' is multiplying 'omega squared' and thus requires division, and 2) applying the power of 2 to the other side of the equation (squaring) rather than performing the inverse operation (square rooting). Option D is also a common 'half-way' error where students correctly root the F but forget that the square root must apply to the entire quotient after division.</explanation>
