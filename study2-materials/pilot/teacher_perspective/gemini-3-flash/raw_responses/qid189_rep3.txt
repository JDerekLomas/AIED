<explanation>The primary misconception involves a failure to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly. Students often perform the subtraction first (1 - 3 = -2) and then multiply by 15, leading to -30 (Option D). However, the most frequent error in my experience comes from students who calculate 1 - 3(15) but ignore the priority of multiplication entirely or treat the expression as (1 - 3) * 15. More specifically, Option C (-14) is a very common 'distractor' result where students calculate 15 - 1 = 14 and then simply attach the negative sign, or they do 1 - 15 to get -14, ignoring the '3n' coefficient entirely. However, focusing strictly on the 'left-to-right' misconception mentioned, many students will calculate 1 - 3 = -2, then -2 * 15 = -30. If they manage the multiplication first (45) but struggle with the directed number subtraction (1 - 45), they often arrive at -44, but many will mistakenly calculate 45 - 1 to get 44 or 46 (Option B) due to number line confusion.</explanation>
