<explanation>Students frequently struggle with the 'balancing' concept when negative numbers are involved. The most common error here is 'operation matching' rather than using the inverse. Jo sees -3 and -5 and thinks that because 5 + 3 = 8, the result must be 8, ignoring the signs. Paul sees the -5 and -3 and similarly thinks he can move one to the other side to make 8. Many students will select C because both Jo and Paul have produced an equation that 'looks' simpler and contains the number 8, which students instinctively feel should be the result of combining 5 and 3. They fail to recognise that to eliminate -5 you must add 5 (resulting in 2v = 6v + 2) or to eliminate -3 you must add 3 (resulting in 2v - 2 = 6v).</explanation>
