<explanation>The primary error is the sign rule: students often remember that "a minus and a minus make a..." but fail to apply it correctly under exam pressure, leading to answer B (-4). In Year 7 and 8, many students also confuse multiplication with addition, leading them to calculate -1 - 4 = -5 (Answer D) or simply add the absolute values to get +5 (Answer C). Even at GCSE level (Years 10-11), the 'invisible' negative sign in front of the 1 and 4 is a persistent source of 'careless' errors where students treat the calculation as 1 x 4 but carry over a negative sign from the original expression.</explanation>
