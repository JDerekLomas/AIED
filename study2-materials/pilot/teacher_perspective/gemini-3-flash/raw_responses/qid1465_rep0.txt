<explanation>The most common error is processing the expression strictly from left to right (3 - 5 = -2, then -2 + 4 = 2, then 2 * 2 = 4), which leads to answer B. This happens because students often view the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) as a secondary rule to the natural reading order. Additionally, many students who do remember to multiply first (4 * 2 = 8) often struggle with the resulting directed number calculation "3 - 5 + 8". They may incorrectly calculate 3 - (5 + 8) leading to -10 (Answer D), or simply fail to handle the subtraction of a larger number from a smaller one correctly. Answer C (-12) is typically chosen by students who add 5 and 4 first (9), then multiply by 2 (18), then subtract from 3.</explanation>
