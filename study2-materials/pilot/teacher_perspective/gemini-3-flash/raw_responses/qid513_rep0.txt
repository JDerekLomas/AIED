<explanation>Students frequently struggle with the concept of inverse operations, often applying the operation they see rather than its opposite. In Step 1, students see '- 4' and instinctively subtract 4 from 15 (getting 11) instead of adding it. In Step 2, they see '2p' (multiplication) and instinctively multiply 11 by 2 (getting 22) instead of dividing. Option C is the most common distractor because students follow Isaac's flawed logic consistently; they see the 'correct' arithmetic results of the wrong operations and assume the algebra is correct. This 'mimicry of operations' is a classic hurdle in early GCSE algebra mastery.</explanation>
