<explanation>The most prevalent error is selecting A (-16). This stems from two main issues: 1) The 'visual' misconception where students see a negative sign and an exponent and instinctively assume the result must remain negative. 2) Calculator dependency; when students type -2^4 into a standard scientific calculator without brackets, the calculator correctly follows BIDMAS and squares 2 before applying the negative, yielding -16. Students then internalise this as the "correct" rule for all negative bases. Option B is also a common 'low-ability' error where students multiply the base by the index (-2 * 4).</explanation>
