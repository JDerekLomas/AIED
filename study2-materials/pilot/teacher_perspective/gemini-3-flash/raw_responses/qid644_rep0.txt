<explanation>The most prevalent error is the sign. Many students correctly identify that 1 multiplied by 4 is 4, but they fail to apply the rule that 'a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive'. Option B (-4) is the most common distractor because students often think that if there is a minus sign involved, the answer must stay negative. Options C and D are chosen by students who confuse the operations and add the numbers (-1 - 4 = -5) instead of multiplying them, which is a common 'cognitive overload' error when faced with brackets.</explanation>
