<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS. Students tend to read the expression left-to-right, calculating -4 + (-5) first to get -9, then multiplying by 3 to get -27 (Option B). This is a dual-threat question because it tests both order of operations and directed number arithmetic. Even students who remember to multiply first often struggle with the signs, sometimes arriving at -11 (Option C) by incorrectly calculating -4 + 15 or making a sign error during the multiplication phase. However, the 'left-to-right' processing remains the most persistent misconception across all Key Stage 3 and lower-tier Key Stage 4 cohorts.</explanation>
