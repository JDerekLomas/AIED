<explanation>The primary misconception here is the "Zero doesn't count" fallacy. Many students believe that because 0 does not add value to the sum, it should not be included in the divisor when calculating the mean. This leads them to choose Option C (dividing by 4). Option B is a common distractor for students who understand the process but fail to apply BIDMAS/Order of Operations, as a calculator would only divide the 7 by 5. Option A is the correct representation of the mean, but many students overlook it because the 0 is omitted from the numerator, even though adding 0 doesn't change the total.</explanation>
