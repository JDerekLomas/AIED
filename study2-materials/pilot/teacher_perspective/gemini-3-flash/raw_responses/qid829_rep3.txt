<explanation>The most common error stems from the calculation of the constant term (-3 multiplied by -2). Many students correctly identify that -3 and -2 sum to -5 for the middle term, but fail to apply the rule that 'a negative times a negative equals a positive' for the final term, leading them to choose D. Year 7 and 8 students often struggle as they may not have been introduced to binomial expansion or are still fragile with directed number rules. By Year 11, while the method is well-rehearsed, sign errors remain the single most frequent cause of marks lost on this topic.</explanation>
