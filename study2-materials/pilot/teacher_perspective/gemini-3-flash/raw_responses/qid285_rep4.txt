<explanation>The high error rate in younger years is due to lack of exposure to rearranging (changing the subject) and the use of Greek letters, which students find intimidating. The most common error (A) stems from the specific misconception mentioned: instead of dividing by r, students 'move' it and keep the same operation (multiplication), and instead of square-rooting to undo the square, they square the other side. Option D is also a very common distractor for Year 10/11 students who understand the inverse operations but fail to apply the square root to the entire expression (r and F), or incorrectly apply the order of operations by rooting before dividing.</explanation>
