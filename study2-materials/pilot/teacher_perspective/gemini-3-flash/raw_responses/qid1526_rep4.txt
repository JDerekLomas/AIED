<explanation>The most persistent misconception in secondary mathematics regarding fractions is the 'add across' error. Students frequently add the numerators (3 + 2 = 5) and the denominators (5 + 7 = 12) to arrive at 5/12 (Option C). This stems from a desire for intuitive symmetry and a lack of conceptual understanding of common denominators. Option A represents a subtraction error or a partial calculation using the 'cross-multiplication' method (21 - 10 instead of 21 + 10), while Option D suggests a student who knows the denominator should be 35 but has simply added the original numerators.</explanation>
