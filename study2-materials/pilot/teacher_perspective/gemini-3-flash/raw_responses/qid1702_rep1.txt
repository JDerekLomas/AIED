<explanation>The primary difficulty lies in the multi-step nature of the substitution and the subsequent algebraic manipulation. Students correctly substitute y = 0.5 to get 10x - 3 = 30. However, the most common error is failing to use the inverse operation correctly; students often subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it, leading to 10x = 27 and x = 2.7 (Option D). Additionally, weaker students may struggle with the initial multiplication of 6 * 0.5 or incorrectly substitute 0.5 for x instead of y, leading to other distractors. In Year 7 and 8, many students will not have encountered linear equations in this form (ax + by = c), making the success rate very low.</explanation>
