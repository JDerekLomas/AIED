<explanation>The most common error in this specific question stems from students performing the same operation as seen in the expression rather than the inverse. To solve for x, students should subtract 1 and then divide by 2. However, many students (particularly those prone to the misconception identified) will add 1 to the bounds (-3+1=-2, 7+1=8) or, more commonly, multiply by the coefficient of x rather than dividing. Option D is a classic "distractor" where students have added 2 and multiplied by 3, or performed other non-inverse operations. Additionally, the "double-ended" inequality often confuses students who are only used to one-sided inequalities, leading them to only process the right-hand side or lose track of the negative signs on the left.</explanation>
