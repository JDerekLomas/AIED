<explanation>The most common error is the 'floating sign' or 'matching operation' misconception. Students see a '-3' or a '-5' and instinctively believe that to 'move' it to the other side, they must perform that same operation (subtracting) rather than the inverse (adding). Jo has subtracted 3 from -5 to get -8, and Paul has subtracted 5 from -3 to get -8. Because both students have performed a logical-looking (though mathematically incorrect) step that results in the same numerical value (-8), many students select C, believing both methods are valid 'shortcuts'. Only higher-attaining students consistently recognise that the inverse operation is required to maintain the equality.</explanation>
