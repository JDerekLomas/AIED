<explanation>The most common error is the "add across" misconception, where students add the numerators (2+1=3) and the denominators (9+3=12) independently, leading to Option B. This stems from a misapplication of multiplication rules to addition. Option C is also a common distractor for students who recognise they need a common denominator but fail to adjust the numerator of the second fraction (2/9 + 1/9), while Option D represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the operation entirely.</explanation>
