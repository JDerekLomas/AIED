<explanation>The correct equation is 10x + 30 = 180, leading to 10x = 150 and x = 15. Students choosing D (x = 21) typically set up the equation correctly but fail at the inverse operation stage: they calculate 180 + 30 = 210, then 210 / 10 = 21. This confirms the misconception of using the same operation (+30) rather than the inverse (-30). Younger students (Year 7-8) often struggle further by either setting the sum to 360 or failing to simplify the algebraic terms correctly.</explanation>
