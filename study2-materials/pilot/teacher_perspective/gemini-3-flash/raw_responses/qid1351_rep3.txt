<explanation>The primary error is a combination of poor directed number skills and 'operation matching'. Students often see the -3 and 12 and perform 12 - 3 to get 9, leading them to p = -9 (Option C) or p = 9 (Option A). Many students struggle when the constant is on the left-hand side of the equals sign, often incorrectly 'moving' the -3 instead of the +12. Option C is the most common distractor because students correctly identify that the answer should be negative but fail to apply the inverse operation of subtracting 12 from -3 (-3 - 12 = -15).</explanation>
