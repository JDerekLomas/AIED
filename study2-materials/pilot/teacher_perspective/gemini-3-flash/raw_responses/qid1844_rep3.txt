<explanation>The most prevalent error is confusing the y-intercept with the x-intercepts (roots). Students see the numbers 8 and 6 and immediately associate them with the coordinates, often forgetting to change the sign or, in this case, selecting the roots instead of the intercept (Option B). Among those who know to multiply the constants (-8 * -6), a significant number will make a sign error, leading them to Option D. In younger year groups (7-8), the concept of a quadratic graph is often unfamiliar, leading to 'additive' guesses like Option A.</explanation>
