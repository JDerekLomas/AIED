<explanation>The most common error is the 'difference' misconception (Option C), where students see -3 and 12 and simply find the difference between their absolute values (12 - 3 = 9) then incorrectly apply a sign. Option A is the specific result of the tested misconception (failing to use the inverse), where students do 12 - 3 = 9. However, in my experience, the presence of the negative constant on the left-hand side frequently causes 'cognitive overload' where students abandon formal algebraic steps and try to find a number that 'looks right' with 12 and 3, leading them to 9 or -9. Year 7s struggle significantly with the variable being on the right-hand side, often trying to 'read' the equation from left to right as a subtraction.</explanation>
