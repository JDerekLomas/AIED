<explanation>The most common error is choosing C (2/9). This stems from two distinct misconceptions: first, students often believe they should 'add' probabilities for combined events rather than multiply them. Second, when adding the fractions 1/4 and 1/5, many students demonstrate the classic 'freshman's dream' error where they add the numerators and denominators directly (1+1=2 and 4+5=9). Answer A (1/9) is also a common distractor for those who know to multiply but still add the denominators, or those who think there are 9 total outcomes and only 1 way to get it, but '2/9' usually wins out because students feel they have 'two' spinners so the numerator must be 2.</explanation>
