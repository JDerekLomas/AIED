<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly. Students frequently process the calculation from left to right, performing -4 + (-5) first to get -9, then multiplying by 3 to reach -27 (Option B). This is exacerbated by the presence of negative numbers; students often focus so much cognitive load on handling the signs that they revert to "reading" the expression like a sentence. Option C is a common secondary error where students apply BIDMAS but fail the integer arithmetic (-5 * 3 = -15, then -4 - 15 = -19, but students may incorrectly calculate -4 + 15 = 11 or similar).</explanation>
