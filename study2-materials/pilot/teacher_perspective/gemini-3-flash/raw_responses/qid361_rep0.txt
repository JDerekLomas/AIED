<explanation>The most common error is choosing 'C' because students fail to recognise that Paul's expression violates the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students often read the word problem linearly and assume that because the 'multiply by 7' comes last in the text, it should simply be written at the end of the expression. They lack the structural understanding that the final multiplication must apply to the entire preceding result, requiring an outer set of brackets. Many students see Paul's use of double brackets as "looking mathematical enough" to be correct without checking the distribution of the 7. Younger students (Year 7-8) also struggle with the fraction bar notation as a grouping symbol, often preferring Paul's division sign notation despite its incorrect placement relative to the addition of 4.</explanation>
