<explanation>The most common error is processing the calculation from left to right (12 ÷ 2 = 6, then 6 + 1 = 7, then 7 × 2 = 14), leading to answer C. Students often forget that multiplication takes priority over addition. Another common error is answer A, where students perform the division and addition first (7) then add 2, or misinterpret the BIDMAS hierarchy by thinking addition comes before multiplication because 'A' comes before 'M' in some mnemonic variations, though left-to-right remains the dominant intuitive error.</explanation>
