<explanation>The most common error is the "left-to-right" misconception (Option A), where students ignore the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and simply calculate 5 + 4 = 9, then 9 x 3 = 27. Despite being taught the priority of multiplication over addition from Year 6 onwards, many students revert to reading the expression like a sentence. Even at GCSE level (Year 10/11), a significant number of students under pressure or in a non-calculator context will fall back on this intuitive but incorrect linear processing.</explanation>
