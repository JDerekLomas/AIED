<explanation>The most common error is calculating strictly from left to right (18 ÷ 2 = 9; then 9 + 2 = 11; then 11 × 2 = 22), leading to option C. Students often view the equals sign as a prompt to "do something" with the next number they see rather than treating the expression as a whole. Even students who know the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS often mistakenly believe Addition comes before Subtraction, or Multiplication before Division, or simply forget to apply the rules when the operators are mixed in a linear string. Option A (3) is another common error where students do the addition first (2+2=4), then 18/2=9, then 9/4 or similar confusion, but C remains the dominant distractor due to the 'reading' habit.</explanation>
