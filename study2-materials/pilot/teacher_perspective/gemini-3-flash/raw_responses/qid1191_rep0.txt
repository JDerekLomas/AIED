<explanation>The most common error (leading to D) is the 'additive' misconception where students use the same operation instead of the inverse. Students often add 5 to 20t (getting 25t) and subtract 5t from 10 (getting 5), resulting in 25t = 5, hence t = 1/5. Another common error is failing to group like terms correctly across the equals sign, often resulting in 15t = 5 (t = 1/3, not an option) or 25t = 15 (t = 3/5). Year 7 and 8 students frequently struggle with the concept of "doing the same to both sides" when variables appear on both sides of the equation.</explanation>
