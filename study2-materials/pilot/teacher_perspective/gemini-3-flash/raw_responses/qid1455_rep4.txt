<explanation>The most common error is selecting Option A because it follows the chronological order of the words in the sentence. Students often translate "add five then multiply by four" directly into "n + 5 * 4" without considering the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). They fail to recognise that without brackets, the multiplication would happen first. Option B is a secondary common error where students are used to the standard "ax + b" format for linear equations and map the numbers onto that familiar structure regardless of the logic. Year 7 and 8 students particularly struggle with the formal algebraic notation required to show that an entire expression must be operated on as a single unit.</explanation>
