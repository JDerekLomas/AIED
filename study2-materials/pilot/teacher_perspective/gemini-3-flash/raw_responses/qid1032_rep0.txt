<explanation>The most common error is the "left-to-right" misconception (Option A), where students process the calculation in the order it is read (5+4=9, then 9x3=27). Despite being taught BIDMAS/BODMAS repeatedly, many students view addition and multiplication as having equal priority or simply follow the visual flow of the sentence. Younger students often forget the rule entirely, while older students in lower sets often revert to left-to-right processing under exam pressure or when they lack confidence in arithmetic conventions.</explanation>
