<explanation>The most persistent misconception in secondary mathematics regarding fractions is the 'add across' error. Students frequently add the numerators (3+2=5) and the denominators (5+7=12) to get 5/12 (Option C). This is an intuitive leap because it follows the logic of multiplication and integer addition. Option A is a secondary distractor for those who know they need a common denominator of 35 but perform a subtraction or a calculation error (21-10 instead of 21+10). Option D represents a misunderstanding of the common denominator process where the numerator is simply added without scaling. Even at Year 11, under exam pressure, a significant minority of Foundation students revert to the 'add across' method.</explanation>
