<explanation>The most common error is the 'add across' misconception (Answer D), where students add the whole numbers (2+2=4), then the numerators (7+1=8), and then the denominators (10+4=14). This stems from a misunderstanding of the need for a common denominator. Even students who understand common denominators often struggle with mixed numbers, sometimes choosing A because they convert to improper fractions correctly but fail to convert back to the requested mixed number format, or C due to multiplying the denominators instead of finding the lowest common multiple.</explanation>
