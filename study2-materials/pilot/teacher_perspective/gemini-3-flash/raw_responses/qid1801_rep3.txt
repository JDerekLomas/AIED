<explanation>The most common error stems from the misconception identified: using the same operation instead of the inverse. Students choosing option A have seen '+1' and added 1 to both ends (-5+1=-4, 5+1=6) and then seen '2x' and multiplied by 2 (-4*2=-8, 6*2=12, roughly leading to the values in A). However, even more specifically, many students struggle with the 'three-sided' nature of a double inequality. Younger students (Year 7-8) often haven't encountered this notation and will guess or treat it as a single inequality. Option C is a common 'distractor' for those who make a sign error with the negative (-5-1 becoming -4 instead of -6). Option A remains the strongest distractor for those failing to use inverse operations correctly.</explanation>
