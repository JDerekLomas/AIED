<explanation>The most common error (Option A) stems from students failing to apply inverse operations correctly. Instead of dividing by 'r', they may attempt to move it to the other side without changing the operation, or more commonly, they misinterpret the square power. Many students see the squared symbol and think the inverse is to square the other side (F²) rather than square rooting the entire expression. In Year 7 and 8, the concept of changing the subject is often not yet mastered, and the use of Greek letters like omega (ω) adds a layer of 'notation anxiety' that leads to guessing. Option D is also a frequent distractor for higher-tier students who understand the square root is needed but fail to apply it to the denominator after the division step.</explanation>
