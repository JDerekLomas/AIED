<explanation>Students frequently struggle with inverse operations and the priority of operations in equations. Tom's error is "moving" the -6 by adding it to the 10 before dealing with the denominator, which is a common mistake when students don't see the fraction bar as a grouping symbol. Katie's error is applying the division by 2 to the 10 (getting 5) instead of multiplying. Many students will see both "logical-looking" manipulations and assume both are valid alternative routes, leading them to choose C. They often fail to check if the operation applied to both sides maintains equality.</explanation>
