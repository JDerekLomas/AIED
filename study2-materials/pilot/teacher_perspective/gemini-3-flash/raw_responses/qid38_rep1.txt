<explanation>The most common error (distractor B) stems from the 'add everything' misconception: students add the numerators (3+4=7) and the denominators (2x+x=3x). Even students who understand they need a common denominator often struggle with algebraic fractions compared to numerical ones. Many will choose D because they correctly identify 2x as the common denominator but forget to multiply the second numerator by 2, simply adding 3 and 4 to get 7/2x. Year 7 and 8 students typically haven't mastered algebraic addition of fractions, leading to very high error rates.</explanation>
