<explanation>The correct equation is 10x + 30 = 180, leading to 10x = 150 and x = 15. Students making the specific 'same operation' error will add the constants (42 - 12 = 30) but then add 30 to 180 instead of subtracting it, resulting in 10x = 210, which gives answer D (x = 21). Younger students often struggle with the multi-step nature of this problem: first forming the expression, then setting up the equation, and finally using inverse operations. Year 7 and 8 students frequently fail to simplify the terms correctly or mistakenly equate the sum to 90 or 360.</explanation>
