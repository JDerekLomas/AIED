<explanation>The most common error is processing the calculation from left to right (8 - 7 = 1, then 1 + 10 = 11, then 11 * 3 = 33), leading to answer D. This stems from a lack of fluency in applying BIDMAS/BODMAS rules, where multiplication must take precedence over addition and subtraction. Answer A (36) is also a common distractor for students who correctly identify the multiplication (30) but then incorrectly process the subtraction/addition by doing 8 - (7 + 30). Answer C represents a fundamental misunderstanding of negative numbers and order of operations combined.</explanation>
