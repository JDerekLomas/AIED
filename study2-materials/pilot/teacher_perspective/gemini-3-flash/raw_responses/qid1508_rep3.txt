<explanation>The most common error is the 'Left-to-Right' misconception, where students ignore the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and simply process the numbers as they appear: 3+6=9, 9÷2=4.5, 4.5+1=5.5 (Option C), or more frequently, they miscalculate the division or round during the process. However, the specific trap in Option D (5) often comes from students doing (3+6) ÷ (2+1), while Option B (3) comes from other procedural inconsistencies. In my experience, despite being taught BIDMAS early on, the instinct to read a mathematical sentence like a piece of text is incredibly strong and persists even into GCSE years, especially under time pressure or when the division results in a non-integer mid-calculation.</explanation>
