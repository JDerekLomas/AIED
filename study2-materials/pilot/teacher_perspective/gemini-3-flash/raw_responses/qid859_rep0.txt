<explanation>The most common error is failing to use inverse operations when moving terms across the equals sign. For option A (d=0), students often subtract 6d from 12d to get 6d, but then mistakenly add the -3 to the +3 on the right-hand side (thinking 3 - 3 = 0) or simply see the numbers 'cancel out'. Option D is another common pitfall where students correctly reach 6d = 6 but then perform 6 ÷ 18 or 2 ÷ 6 due to poor division fluency. In Year 7 and 8, many students struggle with the concept of 'variables on both sides' and will often simply add all the integers together (3+3) and all the coefficients together (12+6).</explanation>
