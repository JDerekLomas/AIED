<explanation>The most common error is answer A (20). Students often substitute x=0 correctly to get 2y=10, but then perform the operation they 'see' (multiplication) rather than the inverse (division). They calculate 10 multiplied by 2 instead of 10 divided by 2. Younger students also struggle with the implicit multiplication in 4x, though since x=0, this is less of a barrier here than the final step of isolating y. Answer D (2.5) is another common distractor for those who confuse the coefficients of x and y, or mistakenly divide 10 by 4.</explanation>
