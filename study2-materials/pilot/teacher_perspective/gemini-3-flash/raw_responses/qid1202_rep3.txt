<explanation>The most common error is Option A (y=2). Students often see the numbers 3 and 5 and intuitively perform the subtraction 5 - 3 = 2, ignoring the negative sign attached to the y. They struggle with equations where the variable is being subtracted (a - x = b). Another significant group will choose Option C (y=8) by incorrectly applying the inverse operation, thinking they must add 3 to 5 because they see a subtraction sign, or simply failing to account for the fact that the 3 is positive. The negative result (y = -2) is counter-intuitive for many students who still believe that "you can't take a larger number from a smaller one" or who struggle with the multi-step process of isolating a negative variable.</explanation>
