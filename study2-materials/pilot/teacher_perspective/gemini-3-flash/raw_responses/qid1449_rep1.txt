<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS rules. Many students read the expression left-to-right, calculating -4 + (-5) first to get -9, then multiplying by 3 to reach -27 (Option B). This is a persistent misconception where students view the expression as a story rather than a set of operations with a specific hierarchy. Additionally, some students struggle with the directed number aspect; those who calculate correctly (3 × -5 = -15) may still falter at -4 - 15, potentially reaching -11 (Option C) if they mistakenly apply 'two minuses make a plus' to an addition/subtraction context.</explanation>
