<explanation>The most common error is option C, which stems from a failure to recognize the 'n-shaped' (negative) nature of the parabola. Students frequently identify the roots correctly as -5 and 1, leading them to the factors (x+5) and (x-1), but they often forget to check the coefficient of x². Even high-achieving students often default to the 'standard' positive quadratic form. Option D is also a common distraction for students who confuse the signs of the roots with the signs inside the brackets (e.g., seeing a root at -5 and choosing a factor of (x-5)). In Year 7 and 8, the high incorrect percentage reflects that these students generally haven't covered quadratic factorisation or sketching, leading to pure guesswork based on the numbers visible on the axes.</explanation>
