<explanation>The most common error is processing the calculation from left to right (3+6=9, 9/2=4.5, 4.5+1=5.5, which is option C) or, more frequently, performing both additions before the division (3+6=9 and 2+1=3, then 9/3=3, which is option B). However, the specific misconception tested here is the standard left-to-right processing without BIDMAS/order of operations. Many students will calculate 3+6=9, then 9/2=4.5, then 4.5+1=5.5. Surprisingly, a high volume of students also mistakenly group the numbers around the division sign, calculating (3+6) / (2+1) to get 3. In my experience, Option D is often the result of students performing 6/2=3, then adding 1 to get 4, but then forgetting the initial 3 or misapplying the sequence, though 5.5 (C) is the most mathematically "logical" wrong answer for the left-to-right error.</explanation>
