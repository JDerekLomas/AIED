<explanation>The most common error is a failure to correctly invert the fraction (1/2). Many students see the '2' and instinctively feel it should remain in the denominator when moved to the other side of the equation, leading them to Option C (h = A / 2b). This stems from a misunderstanding of 'dividing by a half' being equivalent to 'multiplying by two'. Additionally, lower-ability students often choose Option A because they simply swap the subject (h) with the area (A) without performing any inverse operations, or they are confused by the presence of the 1/2 and don't know how to isolate h.</explanation>
