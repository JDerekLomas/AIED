<explanation>The most common error is selecting B (-4/3). Students often correctly identify the need for the reciprocal to get a magnitude of 1, but they apply a "matching" rule to the sign. Many students mistakenly believe that to get a negative result, both numbers being multiplied must be negative, or they confuse the rules for adding negatives (where two negatives stay negative) with multiplication. Additionally, some students choose C or D because they struggle with the concept of a multiplicative inverse entirely, but B remains the dominant distractor due to the 'sign-matching' misconception.</explanation>
