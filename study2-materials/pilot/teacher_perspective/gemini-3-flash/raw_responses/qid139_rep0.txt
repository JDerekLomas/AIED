<explanation>The most prevalent error is the sign mistake (Option B). Even students who understand the process of expansion often default to 'a negative times a negative is a negative' when working under pressure, or they simply forget to apply the sign rule to the constants. Younger students (Year 7 and 8) frequently confuse addition and multiplication rules, leading them to Option D (-7) or Option A (+7) because they see -4 and -3 and perform an additive operation rather than a multiplicative one. By Year 11, while the 'FOIL' or grid method is well-rehearsed, a significant minority still succumb to the 'negative sign blindness' where they treat the terms as 4 and 3 but then arbitrarily attach a negative sign to the result.</explanation>
