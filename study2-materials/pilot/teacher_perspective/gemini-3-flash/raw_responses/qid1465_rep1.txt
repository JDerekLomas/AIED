<explanation>The most common error is processing the expression strictly from left to right (3 - 5 = -2; then -2 + 4 = 2; then 2 * 2 = 4), leading to answer B. This happens because students often view the equals sign as a prompt to "calculate as you go" rather than treating the expression as a single entity governed by BIDMAS/BODMAS rules. Even students who remember the acronym often fail to apply the hierarchy when addition/subtraction appear before multiplication. Answer D is also a common distractor for students who correctly identify that multiplication comes first (4 * 2 = 8) but then struggle with directed numbers, incorrectly calculating 3 - (5 + 8) or making signs errors.</explanation>
