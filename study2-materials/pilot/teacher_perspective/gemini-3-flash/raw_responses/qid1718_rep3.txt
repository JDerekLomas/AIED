<explanation>The most pervasive error is the 'Freshman's Dream' or linear distribution misconception, where students simply square both terms inside the bracket individually, leading to Option B (x² - 9) or Option C (x² + 9). Option B is particularly common as students see the minus sign and carry it through without considering the FOIL/grid method. Regarding the specific misconception mentioned (multiplying two negatives), Option A is a classic pitfall for students who remember there is a middle term (-6x) but fail to correctly evaluate (-3) * (-3), intuitively feeling that a subtraction in the bracket must result in a negative constant.</explanation>
