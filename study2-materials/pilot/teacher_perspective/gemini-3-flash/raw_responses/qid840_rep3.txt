<explanation>The most common error is selecting 'Both' (C) because students often fail to distinguish between performing an inverse operation and simply repeating the number they see. Tom has seen the '5' and divided 40 by 5 (getting 8) instead of multiplying, while Katie has correctly divided both sides by 8. Many students believe that 'doing something with the 5' is enough to make Tom's step valid. Additionally, students often struggle with the 'multi-step' nature of this problem, wrongly assuming that you must eliminate the denominator first, leading them to dismiss Katie's perfectly valid division step.</explanation>
