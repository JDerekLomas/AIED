<explanation>The most common error in fraction addition is the 'add across' misconception, where students add both the numerators and the denominators (2+1=3 and 5+5=10), leading to Option D. While Option B is mathematically equivalent to the correct answer, the question specifically asks for a mixed number; however, in my experience, students who understand the concept of common denominators rarely choose the improper fraction over the mixed number unless they have converted it unnecessarily. The primary hurdle here is the instinct to treat the denominator as a standard integer operation.</explanation>
