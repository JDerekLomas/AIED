<explanation>The primary misconception is a literal left-to-right translation of the English sentence into mathematical notation without considering BIDMAS/order of operations. Option B is the most common distractor because students "write what they hear" in the order they hear it (n, then -6, then ÷3). They fail to recognise that in algebra, a fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol. Option D is a secondary error where students apply the division only to the variable, while Option C indicates a confusion between the inverse operation needed to solve the equation and the expression needed to represent the situation.</explanation>
