<explanation>The most common error (Option A) stems from students failing to use inverse operations. Instead of dividing by r and taking the square root, they 'move' the symbols and apply the operation seen in the question (squaring) to the other side. Year 7 and 8 students often haven't encountered formal rearrangement involving squares, leading to high failure rates. In higher years, even students who understand the steps often struggle with the order of operations, sometimes choosing D because they square root before dividing, or incorrectly associating the multiplication of r and w with a need to multiply on the other side.</explanation>
