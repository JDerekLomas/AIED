<explanation>The most common error is option C, driven by a 'left-to-right' processing bias where students translate 'c divided by h' immediately into a fraction and then simply 'tack on' the +4 at the end, ignoring the grouping function of the brackets. Option D is also a frequent 'reversal error' where students confuse the dividend and divisor when moving from horizontal to vertical notation. In Year 7, many students are still transitioning from arithmetic thinking to algebraic notation and often struggle to see the vinculum (fraction bar) as a grouping symbol that replaces brackets.</explanation>
