<explanation>The most common error is the 'add everything' approach (Option C), where students apply a flawed rule of adding both numerators and denominators (2+3 and x+x). This stems from a weak conceptual understanding of fractions as parts of a whole. Even higher-achieving students sometimes over-complicate the problem by applying the 'cross-multiply' method used for different denominators, leading them to Option A, which they then fail to simplify. Option D is a common confusion between the operations of addition and multiplication.</explanation>
