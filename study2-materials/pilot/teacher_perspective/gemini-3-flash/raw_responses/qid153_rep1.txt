<explanation>The most common error (Option B) stems from students instinctively dividing the larger number by the smaller number (12 ÷ 3) rather than performing the correct algebraic inverse (3 ÷ 12). This is a deeply ingrained 'rule' many students subconsciously follow because they are more comfortable with integer results than fractions. Option A and C attract students who struggle with directed numbers or incorrectly apply sign changes when moving terms across the equals sign, but the 'division order' error remains the dominant misconception in this specific layout.</explanation>
