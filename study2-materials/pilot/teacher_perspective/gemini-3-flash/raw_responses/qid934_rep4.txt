<explanation>The most common error (leading to answer A) is a result of students failing to understand the structure of the equation $4x + 2y = 10$. Many students see '$2y = 10$' once $x=0$ is substituted, and instead of dividing by 2 (the inverse operation), they multiply by 2, resulting in 20. Another significant group of students struggle with the implicit multiplication between the coefficient and the variable, or simply guess '5' because they see $10 \div 2$ but often get there through faulty reasoning. In Year 7 and 8, the concept of a linear equation in two variables is often unfamiliar, leading to high error rates.</explanation>
