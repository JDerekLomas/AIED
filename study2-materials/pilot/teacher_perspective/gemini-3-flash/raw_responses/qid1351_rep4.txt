<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply inverse operations correctly when dealing with negative results. Option A (p=9) is the most common distractor because many students simply look at the numbers 12 and 3 and find the difference, effectively calculating 12 - 3 rather than -3 - 12. Students also frequently struggle when the constant term is on the left-hand side of the equals sign, leading them to "collect" the 3 and 12 as 15 (Option D) or mistakenly think the answer must be positive. The negative start point (-3) combined with the requirement to subtract 12 often leads to the common integer arithmetic error of moving towards zero rather than away from it.</explanation>
