<explanation>The primary hurdle is the 'double negative' rule. Many students correctly multiply the first term to get -3m, but then fail to process the multiplication of -3 and -2 correctly. The most common error is Option B, where students either believe a negative multiplied by a negative stays negative, or they simply 'bring down' the minus sign from inside the bracket without considering the multiplier. A smaller cohort chooses Option C by ignoring the negative sign on the 3 entirely. Even at GCSE level (Year 11), this remains one of the most persistent 'slip' errors under exam pressure.</explanation>
