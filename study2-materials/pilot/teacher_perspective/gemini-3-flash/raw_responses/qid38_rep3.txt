<explanation>The most common error is the classic 'add the tops, add the bottoms' misconception, leading to answer B (7/3x). In Year 7 and 8, many students haven't mastered algebraic fractions and will treat 'x' as a label or simply apply numerical fraction misconceptions. Even in Years 10 and 11, students often forget to find a common denominator (2x) and instead just add the numerators to get 7, then struggle with the denominator, often choosing B or D. Answer D is a common 'half-way' error where students recognise the denominator should be 2x but forget to multiply the second numerator by 2.</explanation>
