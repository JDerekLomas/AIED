<explanation>The primary error is the 'negative times a negative' rule. Many students successfully multiply the first term to get -5m, but then simply 'bring down' the minus sign from inside the bracket or believe that a negative multiplied by a negative stays negative, leading to -35. In Year 7 and 8, many students also struggle with the basic distributive property, but by Key Stage 4, the error is almost exclusively related to the directed number signs.</explanation>
