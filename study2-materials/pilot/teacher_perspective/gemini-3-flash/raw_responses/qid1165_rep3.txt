<explanation>The primary error is the 'negative times a negative' rule. Many students correctly identify that 8 x 2 = 16, but their intuition tells them that because both numbers are negative, the result must remain negative (Option D). In Year 7 and 8, students also frequently confuse multiplication with addition, leading them to -10 (Option A). By Year 11, while most know the rule, a significant minority still make 'slip' errors under pressure or when the negative signs are embedded within algebraic brackets rather than presented as a standalone calculation.</explanation>
