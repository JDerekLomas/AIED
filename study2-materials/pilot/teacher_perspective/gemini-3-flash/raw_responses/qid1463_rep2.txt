<explanation>The primary misconception involves the squaring of a negative number within the discriminant ($b^2 - 4ac$). Students frequently calculate $-3^2$ as $-9$ rather than $(-3)^2 = 9$, often exacerbated by incorrect calculator use or the belief that the negative sign 'stays' there. Year 7 and 8 students will almost all get this wrong as the quadratic formula is not on their curriculum (KS3), while Year 10 and 11 students continue to struggle with the directed number rules specifically when indices are involved.</explanation>
