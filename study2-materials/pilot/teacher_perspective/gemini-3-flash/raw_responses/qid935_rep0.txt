<explanation>The most common error (leading to C) occurs because students substitute k=8 to get 2j - 8 = -10, but then fail to use the inverse operation. Instead of adding 8 to both sides, they subtract 8, resulting in 2j = -18, and thus j = -9. Younger students (Year 7/8) often struggle with the negative result and the multi-step nature of the substitution, while older students frequently make the "same operation" sign error under time pressure.</explanation>
