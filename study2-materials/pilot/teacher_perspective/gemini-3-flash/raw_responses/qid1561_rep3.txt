<explanation>The most common error is Option B (t=4). Students frequently divide the larger number by the smaller number (20 ÷ 5) regardless of the algebraic structure, simply because it results in an integer. Younger students often believe that division must result in a smaller number or that the 'bigger number goes first'. Additionally, many students struggle with the final step of 'divide by the coefficient' when that coefficient is larger than the constant, leading them to invert the operation to avoid a fractional answer.</explanation>
