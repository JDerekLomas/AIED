<explanation>The most common error is selecting -16 (A). Students often apply the 'rule' that if the base is negative, the answer must be negative, or they fail to track the pairs of negatives cancelling out (-2 * -2 = 4, 4 * -2 = -8, -8 * -2 = 16). Additionally, many students are misled by their experience with scientific calculators; if they type -2^4 without brackets, the calculator correctly follows BIDMAS and gives -16, reinforcing the misconception that the brackets don't change the sign of the result. Answer B and D are common for students who multiply the base by the index (2 x 4).</explanation>
