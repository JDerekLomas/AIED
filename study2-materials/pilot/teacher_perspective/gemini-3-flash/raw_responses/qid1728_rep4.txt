<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students typically read the expression from left to right, performing the subtraction first (3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 or 1/2) and then multiplying the result by 1/5, leading to the incorrect answer B (1/10). Even students who remember BIDMAS often struggle with the fractional arithmetic required for the correct path (3/4 - 1/20), frequently failing to find a common denominator (15/20 - 1/20 = 14/20 = 7/10).</explanation>
