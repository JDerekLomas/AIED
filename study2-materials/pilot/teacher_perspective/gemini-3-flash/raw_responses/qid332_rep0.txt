<explanation>The most common error is the belief that you can multiply by the denominator (3) without multiplying every term in the equation. Students often think Katie is correct because they recognize the inverse operation of division is multiplication, but they fail to apply it to the '-5'. This 'partial multiplication' is a deep-seated misconception. Furthermore, many students struggle with the order of operations in reverse (SAMDIB/reverse BODMAS), leading them to think both methods are valid 'first steps' depending on preference, rather than understanding the distributive property required for Katie's method to be correct (which would require x - 15 = 36).</explanation>
