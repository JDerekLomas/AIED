<explanation>The most common error is choosing option B (-4/3). Students often correctly identify the need for a reciprocal to reach the magnitude of 1, but they struggle with the sign. There is a deeply ingrained misconception that "a negative times a positive must be negative," which is correct, but students often misapply the rule or over-identify the negative signs they see in the question. Many students believe that to keep the answer negative, the multiplier must also be negative. Additionally, weaker students may choose C or D due to a lack of understanding of reciprocals, but B is the dominant distractor for those who understand the fraction arithmetic but not the directed number rules.</explanation>
