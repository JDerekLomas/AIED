<explanation>The most common error is the 'left-to-right' misconception. Students look at the left-hand side and calculate (8+12) then divide by 4, arriving at 5. Because the right-hand side also results in 5 (due to the brackets explicitly forcing that order), they conclude that both sides are equal and choose C. Even students who remember the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS often fail to apply it when the addition comes first in the expression, as their natural instinct is to read the numbers as they appear. By Year 11, while most understand priority of operations, a significant minority still make 'careless' errors under pressure by defaulting to left-to-right processing.</explanation>
