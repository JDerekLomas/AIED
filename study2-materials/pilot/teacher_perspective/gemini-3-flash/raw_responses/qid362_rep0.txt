<explanation>The most common error is the 'coefficient grab', where students assume the gradient is simply the coefficient of x (4) without rearranging into y=mx+c. For those who do attempt to rearrange, many fail to use inverse operations, incorrectly moving 4x to the other side as a positive or forgetting to divide the entire term by 3. Option B is highly attractive to lower-attaining students who recognize the term 'gradient' is linked to x but lack the algebraic fluency to manipulate the equation. Option D is the second most common error, representing students who understand a division by 3 is necessary but fail to handle the negative sign when subtracting 4x.</explanation>
