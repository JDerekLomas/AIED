<explanation>The primary issue is the 'left-to-right' processing bias. Students often translate word problems into algebra chronologically. In Option A, they see 'n', '+5', and 'x4' in the same order as the text, failing to recognise that without brackets, BIDMAS/order of operations dictates that the multiplication happens before the addition. Many students also confuse 'multiply the result' with 'multiply the last thing I wrote'. Option B is a common error for those who have started learning about 4n but forget the structure of the whole expression, while Option A remains the most seductive 'trap' for those who haven't mastered the use of brackets to group operations.</explanation>
