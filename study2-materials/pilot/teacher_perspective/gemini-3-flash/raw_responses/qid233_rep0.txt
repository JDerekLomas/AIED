<explanation>The most common error is following a 'left-to-right' reading order, leading students to Option A. Many students see '2 ÷ 3' and immediately write it as a fraction, then simply add the remaining terms. They fail to recognise that the parentheses (brackets) dictate that the entire expression (3 + ab) must be the denominator. Furthermore, weaker students often struggle with the 'invisible' multiplication in 'ab' and may be tempted by Option D because it retains the 'x' sign, or Option B if they over-complicate the distributive law. The transition from linear arithmetic notation to fractional algebraic notation is a significant hurdle in Key Stage 3.</explanation>
