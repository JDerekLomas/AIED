<explanation>The primary misconception involves the "floating" of terms without using inverse operations. For option B (1 ≥ n), students often subtract 2 from 3 instead of adding 5 to 2, or they see the 3 and 2 and perform 3-2=1. Option D is also a very strong distractor for those who correctly calculate 7 but incorrectly flip the inequality sign when moving the variable to the right-hand side. Year 7 and 8 students struggle significantly as they often have not mastered the concept of variables on both sides, nor the specific rules for inequalities.</explanation>
