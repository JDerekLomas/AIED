<explanation>The primary error is the 'negative sign' misconception (Option C). Students often calculate 3 to the power of 4 correctly as 81, but mistakenly believe that because the base is negative, the final answer must remain negative. This is exacerbated by poor calculator technique, where students input -3^4 without brackets, yielding -81. Secondary errors (Options B and D) come from students multiplying the base by the index (3 x 4 = 12), a pervasive misconception across all year groups when dealing with indices.</explanation>
