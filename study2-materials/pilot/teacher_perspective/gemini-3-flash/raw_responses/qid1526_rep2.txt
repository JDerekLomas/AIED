<explanation>The most prevalent error in fraction addition is the 'add across' misconception, where students treat the numerators and denominators as independent integers (3+2=5 and 5+7=12), leading directly to Option C. Even high-attaining students often revert to this intuitive error when under pressure or when they haven't practiced common denominators recently. Option A represents a subtraction error or a mistake in the 'cross-multiplication' method (21-10 instead of 21+10), while Option D suggests a partial understanding where the student knows to find a common denominator but still simply adds or multiplies the original numerators incorrectly.</explanation>
