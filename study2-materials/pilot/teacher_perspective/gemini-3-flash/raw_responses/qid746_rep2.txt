<explanation>The most common error is processing the calculation from left to right, ignoring the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students who answer 'D' (4) perform the calculation as (4+12) ÷ (2+2) = 16 ÷ 4 = 4. Even though the brackets are present, many students have a "left-to-right" compulsion that overrides their knowledge of brackets. Answer 'A' (10) is also common, where students do the division before the addition but ignore the brackets: 4 + (12 ÷ 2) + 2 = 12. The correct sequence requires evaluating the brackets first (4), then the division (12 ÷ 4 = 3), and finally the addition (4 + 3 = 7).</explanation>
