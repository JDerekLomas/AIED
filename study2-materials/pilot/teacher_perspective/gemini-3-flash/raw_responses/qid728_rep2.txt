<explanation>The primary misconception here is a rigid, sequential application of BIDMAS/BODMAS without understanding the grouping effect of brackets. Many students select Option A because they see "Addition before Subtraction" in the mnemonic (AS), leading them to group the 6+4 first to get 10, then calculating 16-10=6, and finally 6/2=3 (failing to reach 7, but choosing the option that "looks" like a standard BIDMAS problem). Option D is often overlooked because students struggle to process three terms inside a bracket; they instinctively want to perform the division last to reach the target of 7, but often fail to check the internal priority of the 16-6+4. Students also frequently default to a left-to-right reading strategy, which makes them resistant to brackets that encompass the start of the expression unless it "feels" right.</explanation>
