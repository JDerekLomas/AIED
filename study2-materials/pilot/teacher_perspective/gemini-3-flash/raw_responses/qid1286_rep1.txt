<explanation>This is a multi-step rearrangement task involving a fractional coefficient. Lower years (7-8) struggle because the sphere volume formula is not yet part of their core curriculum, and the algebraic manipulation is too advanced. For Years 9-11, the most common error is failing to use the inverse operation when moving the 4/3 and the pi. Option A is a classic "visual" error where students see the 4, 3, and pi and simply multiply them by V rather than dividing. Option B is also frequent as students often forget that pi is in the numerator of the original fraction (4/3 * pi * r^3) and thus should move to the denominator with the 4.</explanation>
