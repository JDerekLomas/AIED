<explanation>The most common error is selecting 'C' (Both) because students often fail to recognise that the final operation (multiply by 7) must apply to the entire previous expression, including the +4. Students frequently read Paul's expression linearly from left to right; because the +4 appears at the end of his expression, they assume it correctly represents the final step of the instruction, failing to notice that his brackets exclude the 4 from the multiplication. Additionally, many students struggle with the hierarchy of nested brackets and the distributive nature of the 7 in Jo's correct version.</explanation>
