<explanation>The most common error is Option B (3/12), where students apply the 'add across' strategy, summing both the numerators (2+1) and the denominators (9+3). This is a persistent misconception rooted in a misunderstanding of fractions as single values rather than parts of a whole. Even in older year groups, students under pressure or with weak foundational fluency revert to this 'intuitive' but incorrect method. Option C is also a common 'distractor' for students who recognize the need for a common denominator but fail to adjust the numerator of the second fraction.</explanation>
