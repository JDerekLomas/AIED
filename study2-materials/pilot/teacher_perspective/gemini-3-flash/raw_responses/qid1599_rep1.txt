<explanation>The most common error is selecting Option C, driven by a literal left-to-right translation of the expression. Students often struggle to conceptualise the vinculum (fraction bar) as a grouping symbol that replaces brackets. In Year 7 and 8, many students still view division primarily through the '÷' symbol and fail to recognise that in algebraic notation, the entire divisor (h+4) must move below the line. Option D is also a frequent 'distractor' for students who understand it should be a fraction but confuse the dividend and divisor (numerator/denominator placement).</explanation>
