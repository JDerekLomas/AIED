<explanation>Students frequently struggle with inverse operations and the priority of operations when solving equations. For Tom's line, many students see '-6' and '+6' to get 16, failing to realise they must multiply the whole side by 2 first or add 12. For Katie's line, they correctly identify the need to move the '2', but they divide 10 by 2 instead of multiplying. Option C is the most common trap because both '16' and '5' are results of using the wrong operation (addition instead of multiplication for Tom, and division instead of multiplication for Katie) on the number 10, which looks 'mathematically plausible' to a struggling student.</explanation>
