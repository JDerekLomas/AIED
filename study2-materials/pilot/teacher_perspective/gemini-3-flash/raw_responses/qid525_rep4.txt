<explanation>The most common error is the 'add across' misconception (Answer D), where students add the whole numbers (2+2=4), then the numerators (7+1=8), and then the denominators (10+4=14). This stems from a misunderstanding of the need for a common denominator and a false analogy with multiplication rules. Answer A is often avoided because students are specifically asked for a mixed number, though it is mathematically equivalent to the correct answer. Students who struggle with finding the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) may also choose C if they simply multiply the denominators to get 40 but then fail to adjust the numerators correctly or fail to simplify.</explanation>
