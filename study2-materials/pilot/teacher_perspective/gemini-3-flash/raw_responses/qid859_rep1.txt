<explanation>The most common error is failing to use inverse operations when moving terms across the equals sign. For Option A (d=0), students often subtract 6d from 12d to get 6d, but then mistakenly subtract 3 from 3 (instead of adding 3 to 3), leading to 6d = 0. Option D is also common, where students correctly get 6d = 6 but then divide 6 by 18 (mistakenly adding the coefficients) or perform 6/18 by confusing which number is the divisor. Year 7 and 8 students particularly struggle with the "variables on both sides" concept, often trying to combine all terms without regard for the equals sign.</explanation>
