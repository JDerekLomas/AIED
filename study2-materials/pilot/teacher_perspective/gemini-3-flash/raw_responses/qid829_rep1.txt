<explanation>The most common error stems from the multiplication of two negative integers (-3 and -2). Many students correctly identify that -3 + -2 = -5 for the middle term, but then fail on the constant term by calculating -3 × -2 as -6 (Option D) or by incorrectly combining the signs to get -1m (Option B). Year 7 and 8 students often haven't mastered binomial expansion, while Year 10 and 11 students often make 'reversion' errors under pressure, defaulting to the idea that "a minus and a minus make a minus" when multiplying, or simply making a sign slip on the final term.</explanation>
