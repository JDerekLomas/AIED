<explanation>The most common error in this specific question stems from students failing to use inverse operations. Option A is the result of adding 1 to both sides (-5 + 1 = -4, 5 + 1 = 6) and then multiplying by 2 (or simply miscalculating the steps by performing the operations shown rather than their opposites). Many students struggle with the three-part inequality structure, often only applying operations to one side or the other. Additionally, Year 7 and 8 students frequently haven't been introduced to double-sided inequalities, leading to high incorrect rates. Even in Year 11, the negative sign on the left (-5) causes sign errors; students choosing C often correctly subtract 1 but then struggle with -6 divided by 2, or they simply guess due to the symmetrical nature of the bounds.</explanation>
