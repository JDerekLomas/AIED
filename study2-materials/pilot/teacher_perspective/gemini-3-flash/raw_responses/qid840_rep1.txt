<explanation>The most common error is choosing 'Both' (C) because students frequently confuse inverse operations with the operation shown in the question. For Tom's working, many students see the '5' and '40' and instinctively divide (40 ÷ 5 = 8) rather than multiplying by the denominator. For Katie's working, while correct (dividing both sides by 8), many students struggle to see this as a valid 'first step' compared to the more traditional method of multiplying by the denominator first. Younger students in Year 7 and 8 often struggle with the fractional notation of division entirely, leading to high error rates.</explanation>
