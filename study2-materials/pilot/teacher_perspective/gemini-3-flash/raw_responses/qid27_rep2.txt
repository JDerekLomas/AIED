<explanation>The most common error is failing to correctly handle the double negative (subtraction of a negative product). Students typically calculate 2 * -2 = -4, but then perform 10 - 4 to get 6 (Option B), or they simply forget the sign rules entirely and think -2 * -2 = -4, leading to 10 - 4. Option A is chosen by students who believe 10 - 2 is 8, then multiply by -2, or perform 10 - 22 (concatenation). Option B remains the dominant distractor across all year groups because it feels "right" to subtract when a minus sign is visible, failing to recognise that -2d means (-2) * (-2).</explanation>
