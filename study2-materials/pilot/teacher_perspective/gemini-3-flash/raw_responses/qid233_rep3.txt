<explanation>The most common error is a 'left-to-right' processing bias (Option A), where students treat the division as applying only to the first term (2 ÷ 3) rather than the entire bracketed expression. Students often struggle with the transition from linear arithmetic notation to fractional algebraic notation. Option D is also a frequent 'distractor' for lower-attaining students who recognize the structure but fail to apply the convention of omitting the multiplication sign (×) in algebra.</explanation>
