<explanation>The most common error is choosing option B because it follows the linear, left-to-right reading of the sentence ("take away six" then "divide by three"). Students often fail to recognize that in formal algebraic notation, the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) must be maintained. Without brackets or a vinculum (the fraction bar), the division in option B would technically be performed before the subtraction. Option D is a secondary distractor for students who confuse the structure of two-step equations, while option C is a common error for those who confuse 'divide' with 'multiply'.</explanation>
