<explanation>The most common error is the 'add across' misconception, where students treat numerators and denominators as independent integers (1+1+2+3=7 and 3+4+3+4=14), leading to Option B. While the numbers are chosen to encourage grouping (1/3 + 2/3 = 1 and 1/4 + 3/4 = 1), weaker students often default to a procedural algorithm. Some may attempt to find a common denominator of 12 but make arithmetic errors in conversion, leading to Option A or D, but the 'freshman's error' of adding denominators remains the most prevalent mistake across all key stages.</explanation>
