<explanation>The most common error is a failure to correctly handle the multiplication of two negative constants (-5 and -7). While many students successfully use the FOIL method or a grid to find the middle term (-12m), they frequently default to "negative times a negative equals a negative" when calculating the final term, leading them to choose D. Year 7 and 8 students often haven't mastered binomial expansion yet, while Year 10 and 11 students often make this mistake due to cognitive load or "sign blindness" during exam pressure.</explanation>
