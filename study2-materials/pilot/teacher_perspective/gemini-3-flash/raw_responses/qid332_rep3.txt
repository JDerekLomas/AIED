<explanation>The most significant hurdle here is the 'selective' multiplication of terms. Students frequently believe that to 'get rid' of a denominator, they only need to multiply the fraction and the answer on the RHS, completely forgetting to multiply the independent constant (-5). They see Katie's logic of $12 \times 3 = 36$ as intuitive and fail to recognise that the subtraction of 5 must also be scaled if the entire equation is multiplied by 3. This leads a majority of students to choose 'Both', especially those who have been taught 'cross-multiplication' or 'moving' numbers without a deep understanding of maintaining equality through balancing.</explanation>
