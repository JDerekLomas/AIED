<explanation>The most common error is choosing 'C' (Both) because students read Paul's expression from left to right and assume the '+ 4' and '7' are applied in the order they appear in the sentence. They fail to recognise that in Paul's version, the multiplication by 7 only applies to the division term, not the '+ 4', due to the BIDMAS/order of operations. Many students struggle with the nested nature of function machines when converted to algebraic notation, specifically the requirement for outer brackets to 'protect' the result of previous additions/subtractions before a final multiplication.</explanation>
