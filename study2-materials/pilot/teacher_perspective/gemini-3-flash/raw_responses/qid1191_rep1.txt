<explanation>The most common error (leading to answer D) is the 'same operation' misconception. Students see the -5 and +10 and decide to add them to get 15, then see 20t and 5t and add them to get 25t, resulting in 25t = 5 (or 15). Alternatively, they subtract 5t from 20t to get 15t, but then subtract 10 from 5 (or vice versa) because they fail to use the inverse operation when moving terms across the equals sign. Answer A (t=0) is also a common 'panic' answer when students conflate the terms and assume they cancel out.</explanation>
