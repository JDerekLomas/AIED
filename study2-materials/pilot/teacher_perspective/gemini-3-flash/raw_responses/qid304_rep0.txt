<explanation>The most prevalent error is the 'Left-to-Right' bias, where students simply process numbers as they read them (Option A). Despite BIDMAS/BODMAS being taught from Year 6, many students struggle to override their natural reading instinct. Option B is also a common distraction for students who remember that 'multiplication comes before subtraction' but forget that brackets take absolute priority. Even in Year 11, under pressure, a significant minority of students will fall back on the intuitive left-to-right approach rather than applying the formal hierarchy of operations.</explanation>
