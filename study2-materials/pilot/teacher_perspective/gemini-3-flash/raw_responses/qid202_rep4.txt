<explanation>The most common error in fraction addition is the 'add everything' strategy, where students add the numerators (1+2=3) and the denominators (5+5=10), leading to answer D. While many students correctly identify that 2+1=3 for the whole number part, the intuition to treat the denominator as a value to be summed rather than a common unit remains a persistent misconception. Answer B is mathematically correct but fails the instruction to provide a 'mixed number', a common source of lost marks for higher-ability students who over-complicate the process by converting to improper fractions first.</explanation>
