<explanation>The most common error is the "division order" misconception. Students correctly identify that they need to divide by 20 to isolate t, but they reflexively divide the larger number by the smaller number (20 ÷ 5) rather than the correct order (5 ÷ 20), leading them to answer B (t=4). Additionally, weaker students often struggle with equations where the solution is a fraction less than 1, as they assume the answer must be an integer. A smaller cohort may choose C or D due to confusion over sign changes when moving terms across the equals sign.</explanation>
