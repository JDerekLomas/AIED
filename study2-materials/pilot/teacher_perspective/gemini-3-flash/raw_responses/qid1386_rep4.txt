<explanation>The most common error is the "add everything" strategy (Option C), where students treat the numerator and denominator as independent integers, resulting in 5/2x. Year 7 and 8 students often struggle with the abstract nature of 'x' as a common denominator, while older students may over-complicate the problem by attempting to find a common denominator via cross-multiplication (Option A), even though the denominators are already identical. Option D represents a confusion between addition and multiplication rules.</explanation>
