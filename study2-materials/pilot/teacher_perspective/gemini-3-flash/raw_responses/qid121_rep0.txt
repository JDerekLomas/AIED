<explanation>The most common error is failing to handle the sign change when rearranging to the form y = mx + c. Students often correctly identify that they need to divide by 3, but they struggle with the two-step rearrangement. Many will see the 5 and 3 and instinctively choose 5/3 (Option C) because they forget to subtract 5x from both sides, or they simply identify the coefficient of x without considering the full algebraic manipulation required. Year 7 and 8 students typically haven't mastered linear graphs in this implicit form, leading to very high error rates, while Year 11 students still frequently make 'sign errors' under pressure.</explanation>
