<explanation>The most common error is selecting B because students translate the sentence word-for-word into mathematical symbols without considering the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). They see "take away six" and write "- 6", then "divide by three" and write "÷ 3", failing to recognise that the division must apply to the entire result of the subtraction. Many students also confuse the structure of Option D, which represents "divide by three then take away six," showing a lack of understanding of how fraction bars act as grouping symbols.</explanation>
