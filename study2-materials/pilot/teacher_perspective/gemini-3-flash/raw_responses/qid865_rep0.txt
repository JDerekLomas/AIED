<explanation>The most common error is selecting option C. Students frequently identify the roots correctly from the graph (x = -5 and x = 1) and correctly recall that the factors should be (x + 5) and (x - 1). However, they often overlook the 'n-shape' of the curve indicating a negative x² coefficient. They see the (x - 1) in option C and assume it matches the root x = 1, failing to realise that expanding (x - 1)(x + 5) results in a positive x² (a 'u-shape'). Option A is correct because (1 - x) provides the root x = 1 while ensuring the leading term is -x² when expanded. Lower year groups (7-8) score very poorly as they likely haven't covered quadratic factorisation or the relationship between roots and factors yet.</explanation>
