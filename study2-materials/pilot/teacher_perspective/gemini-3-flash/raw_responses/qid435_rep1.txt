<explanation>The primary hurdle here is the combination of BIDMAS/order of operations with directed numbers. 

For Option B (the correct answer), many students calculate -28 - 8 = -36 because they fail to see the multiplication as (-4) x 2, or they correctly get -8 but then struggle with the "double negative" effect of subtracting a negative (-28 - (-8)).

Option C is the most common distractor because students frequently believe (-5)² is -25 (misidentifying it as -(5²)). They then calculate -25 + 5 = -20. This misconception—that squaring a negative results in a negative—is incredibly persistent even into Key Stage 4.

Option A often leads to -4 - (-16) = 12, but students often make sign errors mid-calculation, while Option D is usually discounted quickly as it results in a positive 22.</explanation>
