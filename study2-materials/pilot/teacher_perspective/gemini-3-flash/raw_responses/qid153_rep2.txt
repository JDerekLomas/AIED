<explanation>The most common error (Option B) stems from two main issues: first, students often intuitively divide the larger number by the smaller number (12 ÷ 3) regardless of the algebraic structure, and second, they struggle with the concept of a fractional answer when the coefficient is larger than the constant. Option A and C are also frequent due to sign errors when 'moving' the -3 across the equals sign, but the 12/3 vs 3/12 error is the most persistent misconception across all ability levels.</explanation>
