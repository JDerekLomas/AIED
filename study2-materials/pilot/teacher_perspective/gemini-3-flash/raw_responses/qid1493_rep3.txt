<explanation>The primary misconception is the 'left-to-right' bias. Many students instinctively read a mathematical expression like a sentence and assume the operations must be performed in the order they appear. Option C (8-7) is the most common error because '1' feels like a 'friendly' starting point for a calculation. Additionally, while many students memorise the BIDMAS/order of operations acronym, they often forget that 'Indices' (the power of 3) takes precedence over both subtraction and division, or they mistakenly think the index only applies to the final result of the previous operations.</explanation>
