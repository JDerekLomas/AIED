<explanation>The most common error stems from a failure to use inverse operations correctly, specifically after substituting x = 0.3. Students calculate 2(0.3) = 0.6, then correctly subtract this from 12 to get 11.4. However, when faced with 3y = 11.4, they often divide 12 by 3 to get 4 and then incorrectly "add back" the 0.2 (from 0.6/3) or, more commonly, they perform 12/3 = 4 and then add the 0.6/3 to get 4.2 (Option C). Option C is the "additive" error trap. Option A (4.1) is often chosen by students who subtract 0.6 from 12 to get 11.4 but then struggle with the division by 3, or simply try to find a number that "looks right" near 4. The decimal nature of the input (0.3) significantly increases the cognitive load, leading many students to abandon formal algebraic steps in favour of flawed mental estimation.</explanation>
