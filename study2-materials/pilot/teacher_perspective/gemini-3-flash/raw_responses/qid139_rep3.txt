<explanation>The most prevalent error is a failure to correctly apply the rules for multiplying directed numbers, specifically that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive. Many students instinctively see the minus signs and assume the result must remain negative. Additionally, there is a common 'additive' misconception where students perform -4 - 3 to get -7 (Option D) or simply add the absolute values to get +7 (Option A) because they confuse the operation of expansion (multiplication) with the simplification of terms (addition/subtraction). Option B is the most frequent distractor as it shows the student knows to multiply 4 and 3, but lacks the confidence or knowledge to handle the signs correctly.</explanation>
