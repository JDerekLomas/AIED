<explanation>The primary difficulty lies in the multi-step nature of the substitution and the subsequent algebraic manipulation. Students substitute y = 0.5 to get 10x - 3 = 30. Many then incorrectly subtract 3 from 30 (instead of adding) to get 10x = 27, leading to x = 2.7 (Option D). This confirms the 'same operation instead of inverse' misconception. Option A (4.25) is another common trap where students correctly add 3 but then divide 34 by 8 or make a similar arithmetic slip, while others might confuse the x and y positions in the table entirely.</explanation>
