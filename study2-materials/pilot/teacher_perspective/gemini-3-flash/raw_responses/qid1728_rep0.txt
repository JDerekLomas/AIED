<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students typically read the question from left to right, performing the subtraction first: 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 (or 1/2). They then multiply this result by 1/5, leading to 1/10 (Option B). This is a classic "procedural interference" where the ease of the subtraction (having common denominators) lures the student into ignoring the priority of multiplication. Secondary errors include Option A, where students subtract numerators and denominators and then multiply, showing a total lack of fractional arithmetic understanding.</explanation>
