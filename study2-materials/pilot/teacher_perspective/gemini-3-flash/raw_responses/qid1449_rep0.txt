<explanation>The most common error is failing to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly. Students often read the expression from left to right, performing the addition first: (-4 + -5) = -9, then multiplying by 3 to get -27 (Option B). Even students who remember the order of operations often struggle with the directed number aspect; some may calculate -4 + -15 but arrive at -11 (Option C) by incorrectly subtracting 4 from 15, or even 27 (Option A) if they believe "two negatives make a positive" applies to the final addition step.</explanation>
