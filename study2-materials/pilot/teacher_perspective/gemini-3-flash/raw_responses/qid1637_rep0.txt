<explanation>The most common error in this specific question stems from students using the same operation rather than the inverse. For option D, students see '+1' and add 1 to both ends (-3+1=-2, 7+1=8) then see '2x' and multiply by 2 (-2*2=-4, 8*2=16), leading them to a result close to D. Additionally, many students struggle with the 'double-sided' nature of the inequality, often only performing the operation on one side or getting confused by the negative integer (-3 - 1 = -4). Option B is also a common distractor for those who subtract 1 correctly but then fail to divide by 2 properly or ignore the negative sign.</explanation>
