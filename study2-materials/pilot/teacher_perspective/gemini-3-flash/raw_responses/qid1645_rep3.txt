<explanation>The most common error is the 'same operation' misconception cited in the prompt. Students often see '+9' and '3' and instinctively add or multiply rather than using the inverse. Specifically, for answer D, students often subtract 9 correctly to get 30, but then subtract the 3 (instead of dividing) to get 27, or more commonly, they divide 30 by 3 to get 10, but then miscalculate or 'hallucinate' a perfect square nearby. However, the specific error targeted here is the failure to divide by 3 first; many students will do 39 + 9 = 48, then 48 / 3 = 16, then square root to get +/- 4 (Option D). Option A is also common for students who add 9 and then add 3. In Year 7 and 8, many students haven't mastered solving two-step equations involving squares, leading to very high error rates.</explanation>
