<explanation>The most common error is failing to apply the correct order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students frequently work from left to right, calculating 2 x 3 = 6 first, and then squaring the result to get 36 (Option C). Another significant cohort of students will mistake the exponent for a multiplier, calculating 2 x (3 x 2) = 12 (Option B). Even in Year 11, under exam pressure, many students default to a linear left-to-right processing of the expression.</explanation>
