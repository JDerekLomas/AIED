<explanation>The most frequent error is option C (p = -9). Students often correctly identify that they need to move the 12, but they perform the operation 12 - 3 (getting 9) and then simply attach the negative sign from the -3 to the result. Another significant group will choose A (p = 9) by ignoring the negative sign on the 3 entirely (12 - 3). The specific difficulty here is the "negative equals a positive" structure; students are much more successful when the variable is on the left and the constant on the right. Many struggle to process that they are starting at -3 on the number line and moving 12 units to the left (subtracting 12 from both sides).</explanation>
