<explanation>The most common error is the "add across" misconception, where students treat the numerator and denominator as independent integers (3+1=4 and 5+4=9), leading to answer A. This is a persistent intuitive error because it follows the logic of multiplication. Answer B represents a confusion between adding and multiplying (3+1 over 5*4), while C is a calculation error after finding a common denominator. Even at GCSE (Year 11), a significant minority of students revert to these basic errors under time pressure or if they have not mastered the concept of a common denominator.</explanation>
