<explanation>The most common error (Option D) stems from students performing the same operation as seen in the equation rather than the inverse. Students often add 9 to 39 (getting 48) and then divide by 3 (getting 16), finally taking the square root to get 4. Others may struggle with the order of operations in reverse (SAMDIB), perhaps dividing by 3 before subtracting 9. Option A is a distractor for those who miscalculate 30/3 as 25 or similar arithmetic slips. Younger years (7-8) often haven't mastered solving equations with squares or negative roots, leading to very high error rates.</explanation>
