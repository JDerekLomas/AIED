<explanation>The most common error is failing to apply the distributive property to the second term within the brackets, specifically regarding the sign. Students often correctly negate the first term (-2) but then simply 'bring down' the existing subtraction sign, resulting in -2 - 3p (Option B). This stems from a weak understanding of the negative sign outside the bracket representing a multiplier of -1. Younger students or lower-ability GCSE students frequently forget the 'negative times a negative equals a positive' rule when it is embedded within an algebraic expansion, often focusing so much on the 'expansion' process that their basic directed number rules slip.</explanation>
