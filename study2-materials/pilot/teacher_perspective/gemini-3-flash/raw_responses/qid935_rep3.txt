<explanation>The most common error (leading to answer C) occurs when students substitute k=8 to get 2j - 8 = -10, but then fail to use the inverse operation. Instead of adding 8 to -10, they subtract 8 from -10, resulting in 2j = -18 and j = -9. This is a classic 'same operation' error often exacerbated by the presence of negative numbers. Answer B is also a common distraction where students ignore the negative signs entirely (2j + 8 = 10, so j = 1), but C specifically targets the misconception of failing to use the additive inverse when crossing the equals sign.</explanation>
