<explanation>The primary hurdle here is the squaring of a negative number. Students often calculate -1 squared as -1 rather than 1. When they then calculate -2 multiplied by -1, they frequently get -2 (Option A) or correctly get +2 but then combine it with their initial error. 

Option D (0) is the most common error because students often perform the calculation as: (-1)^2 - 2(-1) + 1 -> -1 - 2 + 1 = -2, or more commonly, they lose track of the signs entirely and do 1 - 2 + 1 = 0. 

In higher year groups, even those who know 'minus times a minus is a plus' often fall victim to 'calculator error' logic where they type -1² into a scientific calculator without brackets, yielding -1, and they trust the machine over their own arithmetic rules.</explanation>
