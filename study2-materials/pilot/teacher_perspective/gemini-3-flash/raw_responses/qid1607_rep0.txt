<explanation>The most common error is the 'operation mimicry' misconception. In Step 1, students correctly identify the inverse of division is multiplication (15 * 4 = 60). However, in Step 2, they see the '+1' and, instead of performing the inverse operation (subtracting 1 to get 59), they instinctively add 1 to the 60 to get 61. Many students will select C because they focus on the numerical manipulation (60 + 1) rather than the algebraic requirement of balancing the equation. Younger students in Year 7 and 8 often struggle with the multi-step nature of this problem and are highly likely to validate Step 2 because '60 + 1 = 61' is a true arithmetic statement, ignoring the context of solving for k.</explanation>
