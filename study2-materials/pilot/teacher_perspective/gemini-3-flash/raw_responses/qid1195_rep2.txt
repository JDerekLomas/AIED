<explanation>The most common error is failing to apply the correct order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students frequently work from left to right, calculating 2 x 3 = 6 and then squaring the result to get 36 (Option C). Another significant cohort of students will mistake the exponent for a multiplier, calculating 3 x 2 = 6 and then 2 x 6 = 12 (Option B). Even in Year 11, under exam pressure, the 'left-to-right' instinctive processing remains a persistent error pattern for foundation-tier students.</explanation>
