<explanation>The primary error is a combination of poor directed number skills and the 'same operation' misconception. Many students see the 12 and the 3 and instinctively find the difference (9) because the negative sign on the 3 is cognitively demanding. Those who do attempt the inverse often perform 12 - 3 (Option A) or -3 + 12 (Option C) because they struggle to correctly apply the subtraction of 12 from a negative starting point. Option A is the most common 'low-confidence' guess where students ignore the negative sign entirely.</explanation>
