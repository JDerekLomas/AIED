<explanation>The most common error is failing to use inverse operations. Students often see the '+1' and add it to the boundaries (-3+1=-2 and 7+1=8) or, as specifically targeted by option D, they see the '+1' and '2x' and perform the operations shown (e.g., -3-2 and 7*2+1) or simply apply the wrong inverse. Option D specifically reflects the misconception of multiplying by 2 and adding 1 to the limits (-3*2+1=-5 and 7*2+1=15) rather than subtracting 1 and dividing by 2. Additionally, many students in lower years have not yet been introduced to double-sided inequalities, leading to confusion or guessing.</explanation>
