<explanation>The most common error stems from a failure to use inverse operations correctly, specifically when dealing with the constants. Many students see '+2' and '-5' and instinctively combine them to get '-3' (leading to option A) or, more commonly, subtract 2 from 5 to get 3, then divide by the difference in n-terms, leading to an answer involving 1 (Option B). Furthermore, students often struggle when the variable ends up on the right-hand side; they may correctly reach 7 ≥ n but then reflexively flip the inequality sign to 'n ≥ 7' (Option D) because they are used to seeing the variable on the left, not realizing that flipping the sides requires flipping the symbol. Option B is particularly attractive to students who make the 'same operation' error (5 - 2 = 3) and then divide by the 1n difference.</explanation>
