<explanation>The most common error in fraction addition is the 'additive strategy', where students simply add all the numerators (1+1+2+3=7) and all the denominators (3+4+3+4=14), leading to Option B. Even though this specific question can be solved easily by grouping like-denominators (1/3 + 2/3 = 1 and 1/4 + 3/4 = 1), many students revert to mechanical, incorrect procedures when they see multiple terms. Option A is a common error for students who try to find a common denominator but only add the first two terms or get lost in the process. Option D represents a student who correctly finds a common denominator of 12 but makes a calculation error in the numerators or fails to simplify.</explanation>
