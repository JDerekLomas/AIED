<explanation>Students struggle with this question due to a combination of substitution errors and multi-step algebraic manipulation. The most common error (leading to D) occurs when students correctly substitute y = 0.5 to get 10x - 3 = 30, but then subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it (10x = 27, so x = 2.7). This confirms the "same operation instead of inverse" misconception. Additionally, some students struggle with the decimal 0.5, mistakenly calculating 6 * 0.5 as 3.5 or even 6.5. Year 7 and 8 students often haven't encountered equations in the form ax + by = c, leading to very high error rates.</explanation>
