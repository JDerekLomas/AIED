<explanation>The primary misconception is two-fold. First, many students incorrectly believe that squaring a negative number results in a negative value (e.g., thinking (-2)² is -4), leading them to pick C or D because they expect the result to be negative. Second, students often have a 'whole number bias' and struggle to conceptualise that squaring a fraction or decimal between 0 and 1 results in a smaller value (0.5² = 0.25), which is necessary for the expression 2n² - 1 to result in a negative total (0.5 - 1 = -0.5). Option C is the most common distractor because students see the negative sign and immediately assume it must lead to a negative result.</explanation>
