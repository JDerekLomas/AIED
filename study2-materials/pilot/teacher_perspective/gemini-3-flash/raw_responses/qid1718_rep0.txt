<explanation>The most persistent error across all year groups is the "freshman's dream" misconception, where students simply square the individual terms inside the bracket (x² and 3²), leading them to choice B or C. They fail to recognise that the squared bracket implies multiplying the binomial by itself, thus missing the middle -6x term. Among those who do attempt a full expansion (using FOIL or the grid method), a significant number struggle with directed numbers, incorrectly concluding that -3 multiplied by -3 is -9, which leads them to choice A.</explanation>
