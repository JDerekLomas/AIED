<explanation>The most common error is failing to correctly square a negative number. Students substitute b = -3 into the formula and evaluate (-3)² as -9 rather than 9. This is compounded by the fact that many students type -3² into a non-scientific calculator or a scientific one without brackets, which yields -9. Year 7 and 8 percentages are near-total because the quadratic formula is not typically introduced until Year 9/10, so they would be guessing or applying basic BIDMAS incorrectly to an unfamiliar structure.</explanation>
