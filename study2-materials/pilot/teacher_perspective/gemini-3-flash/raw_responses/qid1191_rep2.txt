<explanation>The most common error in this specific multi-step equation is failing to use inverse operations when moving terms across the equals sign. Students often 'collect like terms' by simply adding the coefficients they see: they might do 20t + 5t to get 25t, and 10 - 5 to get 5, leading to 25t = 5, and thus t = 5/25 or 1/5 (Option D). Another common error is Option A, where students subtract 5t from 20t to get 15t, but then subtract 10 from 10 (or 5 from 5) due to confusion with the signs, resulting in 15t = 0. Option C is chosen by those who correctly get 15t but incorrectly combine -5 and 10 to get -15.</explanation>
