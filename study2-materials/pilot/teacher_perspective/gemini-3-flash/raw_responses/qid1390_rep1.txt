<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students typically read the expression from left to right, performing the addition (1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6) before the multiplication (5/6 * 1/3 = 5/18), leading to option B. This is compounded by the fact that students often find fraction addition more cognitively demanding than multiplication; once they have successfully found a common denominator for the first part, they feel a sense of completion and simply multiply by the final term. Option C is another common distractor for those who add the first two fractions incorrectly by adding numerators and denominators (2/5) then multiplying.</explanation>
