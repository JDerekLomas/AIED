<explanation>The most common error is choosing 'C' (Both) because students read Paul's expression from left to right and assume the '+ 4' and '7' are applied in the order they appear in the text. They fail to recognise that in Paul's version, BIDMAS/BODMAS rules dictate that the multiplication by 7 would only apply to the bracketed term, leaving the +4 isolated at the end. Many students also struggle with the visual representation of the vinculum (fraction bar) acting as a grouping symbol in Jo's correct expression, often preferring Paul's linear notation because it mirrors the chronological order of the instructions, despite being mathematically incorrect due to the placement of the final set of brackets.</explanation>
