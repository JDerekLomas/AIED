<explanation>The most common error is choosing option D (-9). Students frequently associate the removal of a number with subtraction, regardless of the relationship between the coefficient and the variable. They see a '9' and want it 'gone', leading them to subtract. Younger students or lower-attaining students also struggle with the invisible multiplication sign in '9y', often misinterpreting it as an additive relationship. Option B is also a common distractor for students who recognize the inverse relationship but get confused about which operation 'undoes' the current state, but D remains the dominant misconception in UK classrooms when first learning one-step and two-step equations.</explanation>
