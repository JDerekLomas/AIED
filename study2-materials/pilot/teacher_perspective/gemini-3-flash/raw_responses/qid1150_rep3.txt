<explanation>The most common error (Option B) stems from students incorrectly applying the inverse operation to the 'r' term. Instead of multiplying by 'r' to undo the division, students often see the fraction and believe they must divide the other side by 'r'. Additionally, many students struggle with the order of operations in rearranging; they may try to square root before isolating the v^2 term. Option A is also common for students who understand they need to multiply by 'r' but then apply the power of 2 to the wrong variable or the entire expression.</explanation>
