<explanation>The most common error is choosing -16 (Option A). This stems from two main issues: first, students often fail to track the 'sign' through repeated multiplication, incorrectly applying the 'negative and a positive makes a negative' rule to the final step. Second, there is significant interference from how calculators handle this input; if a student types -2^4 without brackets, the calculator correctly gives -16 (following BIDMAS/BODMAS), leading students to believe the negative sign is not being squared/raised to the power. Option B (-8) is also common among younger students who multiply the base by the index.</explanation>
