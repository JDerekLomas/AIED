<explanation>The most common error is processing the calculation strictly from left to right (3+6=9, then 9÷2=4.5, then 4.5+1=5.5), which leads to option C. Students often view the equals sign as a signal to perform operations in the order they appear. Another common error is adding the 2 and 1 first (3+6÷3), leading to option D. Even high-achieving students often revert to left-to-right processing when under time pressure or when the division results in a non-integer mid-calculation, as seen here.</explanation>
