<explanation>The most common error is failing to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly. Students often work from left to right, calculating 2 x 3 first to get 6, and then squaring the result to get 36 (Option C). A secondary error is multiplying the base by the index (3 x 2 = 6) and then multiplying by the leading 2 to get 12 (Option B). In Year 7, the 'left-to-right' instinct is very strong, and even by Year 11, under exam pressure, many students revert to this linear processing instead of prioritising the exponent.</explanation>
