<explanation>The most common error (Option B) stems from students instinctively dividing the larger number by the smaller number (12 ÷ 3) rather than performing the correct algebraic inverse (3 ÷ 12). This is a deeply ingrained habit from primary school where divisions usually result in integers. Additionally, many students struggle with equations where the solution is a fraction less than one. Option A is a common secondary error where students correctly identify the fraction 3/12 but incorrectly apply a sign change, confusing the rules of additive inverses with multiplicative ones, or simply mismanaging the movement of the -3 across the equals sign.</explanation>
