<explanation>The primary misconception is two-fold. First, students often believe that squaring a negative number results in a negative value (e.g., thinking (-2)^2 is -4), leading them to select C or D because they expect the result to be negative. Second, many students have a weak grasp of squaring decimals and fractions; they often fail to realise that squaring a number between 0 and 1 results in a smaller value. In option B, 0.5 squared is 0.25, and 2 * 0.25 is 0.5, making the expression 0.5 - 1 = -0.5. Most students will avoid the decimal/fraction options (A and B) due to "fraction phobia" and gravitate towards the negative integers in C and D, erroneously believing they are the only way to achieve a negative result.</explanation>
