<explanation>The most common error is the 'inverse operation' misconception. Students see the -3 on the left and the +3 on the right and instinctively perform 3 - 3 = 0, leading to 6d = 0 (Option A). Alternatively, they may correctly subtract 6d from 12d to get 6d, but then incorrectly subtract 3 from 3 (instead of adding 3 to 3) on the right-hand side. Option D is also a common 'distractor' for students who correctly reach 6d = 2 or 6d = 6 but struggle with the final division or mix up the numerator and denominator.</explanation>
