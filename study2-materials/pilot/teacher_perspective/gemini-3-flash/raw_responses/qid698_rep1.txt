<explanation>The most common error is the 'additive' misconception. Students identify the individual probabilities as 1/4 and 1/5, but instead of multiplying them for independent events, they add them incorrectly by adding both the numerators and the denominators (1+1 over 4+5), leading to 2/9 (Option C). Some students may correctly identify that they need to add the fractions but still perform the 'add numerators, add denominators' error, while others simply see two '1s' and two spinners with a total of nine sections, leading them to Option C via a different faulty logic. Option A is also a common distractor for those who add the denominators but forget to change the numerator.</explanation>
