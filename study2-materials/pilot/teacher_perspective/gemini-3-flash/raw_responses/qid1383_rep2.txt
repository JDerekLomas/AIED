<explanation>The most common error is C (-81), caused by the misconception that an even power of a negative number remains negative. This is often exacerbated by students' experience with calculators, where entering -3^4 without brackets yields -81. Younger students (Year 7-8) also frequently choose B or D (12 or -12) due to the 'multiplication' misconception, where they multiply the base by the exponent (3 x 4) rather than performing repeated multiplication. By Year 11, while most understand indices, a significant portion still fail to correctly apply the 'negative x negative = positive' rule over four iterations.</explanation>
