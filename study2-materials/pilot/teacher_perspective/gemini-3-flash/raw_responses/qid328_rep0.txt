<explanation>The most common error is the 'add across' misconception (Option B), where students treat the numerators and denominators as independent integers (2+1=3 and 9+3=12). This is a persistent intuitive error because it follows the rules of multiplication. Option C is also common for students who recognise they need a common denominator but fail to adjust the numerator of the second fraction (2/9 + 1/9). In Year 7 and 8, many students still lack the procedural fluency to find a common denominator (9) and instead default to the simplest looking operation.</explanation>
