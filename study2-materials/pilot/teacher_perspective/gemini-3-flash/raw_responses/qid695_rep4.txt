<explanation>The most common error is calculating strictly from left to right (18 ÷ 2 = 9, then 9 + 2 = 11, then 11 × 2 = 22), leading to answer C. Many students view the equals sign as a prompt to perform operations in the order they appear. Some students may also choose A by performing the addition first (2 + 2 = 4), then 18 ÷ 2 = 9, then 9 ÷ 4 or similar confused steps, but 'Left-to-Right' remains the dominant misconception for this specific structure.</explanation>
