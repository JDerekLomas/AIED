<explanation>The most common error (Option B) stems from students incorrectly applying the inverse operation for the denominator. Instead of multiplying by 'r' to undo the division, they divide by 'r' again, or simply 'move' the r to the other side without changing the operation correctly. Additionally, many students struggle with the order of operations in rearranging, often attempting to square root before isolating the squared term. Option A is also common among students who confuse the power of 2 with a square root, or simply guess when faced with multiple algebraic steps.</explanation>
