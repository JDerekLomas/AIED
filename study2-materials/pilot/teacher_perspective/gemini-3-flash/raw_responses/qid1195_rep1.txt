<explanation>The most common error is failing to follow the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students frequently read the expression from left to right, performing 2 x 3 first to get 6, and then squaring the result (6²) to get 36 (Option C). A secondary error is multiplying the base by the exponent (3 x 2 = 6, then 2 x 6 = 12, Option B), but the left-to-right processing is the dominant misconception in this specific structure.</explanation>
