<explanation>The most common error is selecting 'Both' (Option C). Students frequently struggle with the 'inverse operation' concept when dealing with fractions. For Tom's working, many students see the 40 and the 5 and instinctively divide (40 ÷ 5 = 8) because they associate the fraction bar with division, but they apply the operation to the RHS rather than performing the inverse (multiplication). For Katie's working, while correct (dividing both sides by 8), many students fail to recognise that you can divide the numerator of a fraction while keeping the denominator constant, or they simply get distracted by Tom's 'clean-looking' result of 8.</explanation>
