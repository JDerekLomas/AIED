<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students typically read the expression from left to right, performing the addition (1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6) before the multiplication (5/6 × 1/3 = 5/18), leading to Option B. Even students who know the rules of BIDMAS often "switch off" when fractions are involved, as the cognitive load of fraction arithmetic distracts them from the structural logic of the expression. Option C is also common for students who add the numerators and denominators (2/5) then multiply, or vice versa.</explanation>
