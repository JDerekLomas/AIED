<explanation>The most common error is choosing B (t=4). Students often default to dividing the larger number by the smaller number (20 ÷ 5) because they are more comfortable with integer results than fractions. Additionally, many students struggle with the final step of the inverse operation; instead of dividing by the coefficient of t (20), they divide by the constant (5). In Year 7 and 8, the concept of a solution being a fraction less than 1 is a significant hurdle, as they often assume equations should "work out nicely" as whole numbers. A smaller subset of students will choose C or D due to confusion regarding the sign when moving the -5 across the equals sign.</explanation>
