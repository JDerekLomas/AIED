<explanation>The primary hurdle here is a combination of two factors: the 'Left-to-Right' misconception and the presence of decimals. Many students instinctively believe that operations should be performed in the order they appear (0.1 minus 0.2 first). Because 0.1 - 0.2 results in a negative number, students often experience 'subtraction anxiety' or 'negative number avoidance'. They look at Katie's suggestion and see 0.2 ÷ 0.3 as a larger value being placed first, which they erroneously assume is a 'fix' to avoid the negative result. Furthermore, students often struggle to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS rules when the numbers aren't simple integers; the cognitive load of the decimals makes them default to the simplest reading (left to right), leading them to reject Tom's correct application of priority.</explanation>
