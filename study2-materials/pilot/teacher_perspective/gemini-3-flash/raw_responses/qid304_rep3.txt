<explanation>The primary misconception is the "left-to-right" bias, where students treat a mathematical expression like a sentence in English. Despite being taught BIDMAS/BODMAS, many students instinctively choose Option A (1+2) because it is the first operation they encounter. Another significant group of students mistakenly believe that addition should come before subtraction or multiplication simply because of the order of letters in the BIDMAS acronym, or they ignore the brackets entirely if they perceive the numbers inside to be "harder" (due to the negative result). Option B is also a common distraction for those who remember they should multiply before adding but forget that brackets take absolute precedence.</explanation>
