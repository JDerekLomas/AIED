<explanation>The most common error (Option D) stems from students using the same operation rather than the inverse. Students see "+9" and add it to 39 to get 48, then divide by 3 to get 16, and finally square root to get 4. Another common error is forgetting the negative root, though this question includes it in all options. Year 7 and 8 students often struggle with the multi-step nature of this equation and the order of operations in reverse (BIDMAS/SAMDEB).</explanation>
