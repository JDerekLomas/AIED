<explanation>The most common error (leading to answer B) occurs because students often fail to use the inverse operation when moving the constant. They see -8 and 'add' it to -10 to get -18, but more commonly, they ignore the negative signs entirely or perform 2j = -10 + 8 = -2 (correct) but then multiply by 2 instead of dividing, or they calculate 2j = 10 + 8 = 18, leading to j = 9. Option B is a 'magnet' for students who struggle with directed numbers and the process of isolating the variable, often simply combining the digits 10 and 8 in an additive way without regard for the negative signs.</explanation>
