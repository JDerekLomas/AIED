<explanation>The primary reason students struggle here is the 'double negative' trap combined with BIDMAS/order of operations. In Option B, many students correctly identify that (-4) x 2 = -8, but then fail to handle -28 - (-8) correctly, often simplifying it to -28 - 8 = -36. Option C is the most common distractor because students frequently believe (-5)^2 is -25 (misapplying the rule that a negative squared is positive, or simply typing it into a non-scientific calculator without brackets), leading them to -25 + 5 = -20. Option A is also a trap where students lose track of the multiple negative signs during the subtraction of a negative product.</explanation>
