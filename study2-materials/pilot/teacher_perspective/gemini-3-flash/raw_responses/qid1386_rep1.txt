<explanation>The most prevalent misconception in fraction addition is the 'add across' error, where students add both the numerators and the denominators (leading to Option C). Even though the denominators are already common, the presence of an algebraic variable 'x' often triggers a sense of panic or over-complication. Students in lower years (7-8) may not have encountered algebraic fractions yet and will apply basic fraction misconceptions. Year 9-11 students often confuse the rules of addition with multiplication (leading to Option D) or feel they must 'do something' to the denominators because they are used to finding a common denominator in more complex problems (leading to Option A).</explanation>
