<explanation>The most common error is processing the expression strictly from left to right (3 - 5 = -2; -2 + 4 = 2; 2 * 2 = 4), leading to answer B. This happens because students often view the equals sign as a prompt to calculate as they read, overriding the rules of BIDMAS/BODMAS. Another significant error is 'C', where students perform the addition before the subtraction (3 - 9 = -6, then * 2 = -12), a result of the common misconception that 'Addition' must come before 'Subtraction' because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym. Even higher-ability students often lapse into left-to-right processing under time pressure.</explanation>
