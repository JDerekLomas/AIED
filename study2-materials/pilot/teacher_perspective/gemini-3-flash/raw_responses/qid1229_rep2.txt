<explanation>This is one of the most persistent misconceptions in secondary mathematics, even among high-attaining students. Most students believe that squaring a negative number always results in a positive answer (Option C). They fail to understand that a scientific calculator follows the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) strictly: it treats -6² as -(6²), calculating the index before the unary minus. Only by using brackets, i.e., (-6)², would the calculator return 36. Options A and B are less common, typically chosen by students who confuse squaring with multiplying by 2.</explanation>
