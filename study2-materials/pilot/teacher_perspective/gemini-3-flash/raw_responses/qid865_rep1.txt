<explanation>The most common error is selecting Option C. Students identify the roots as -5 and 1 and correctly recall that the factors should be (x + 5) and (x - 1). However, they often fail to check the orientation of the parabola (the 'n' shape vs 'u' shape). They assume a positive x² coefficient by default. Option A is frequently missed because students struggle to recognise that (1 - x) is equivalent to -(x - 1), which provides the necessary negative x² term for a downward-opening curve. In lower years (7-8), most students haven't covered quadratics, leading to near-total incorrect guesses based on simple number matching.</explanation>
