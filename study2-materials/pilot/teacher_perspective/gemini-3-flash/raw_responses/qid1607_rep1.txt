<explanation>The most common error is the 'operation mimicry' seen in Step 2. Many students correctly identify that they must multiply by 4 in Step 1 (inverse of division), but then lose focus in Step 2. Instead of performing the inverse operation of adding 1 (subtracting 1 from 60 to get 59), they see the '+1' and instinctively add 1 to 60. This is a classic 'procedural fluency' breakdown where the student follows the sign they see rather than the inverse logic required for balancing equations. In lower years (7 and 8), many students will also struggle with the fractional notation itself, but for those who reach Step 2, 'adding because they see a plus sign' is the dominant misconception.</explanation>
