<explanation>The primary issue is the 'left-to-right' processing bias. Many students read algebraic expressions like a sentence, assuming the order of operations follows the physical layout of the terms (Option C). Even students who know BIDMAS/BODMAS often fail to apply it when translating between algebraic notation and written English. Option B is a common error for students who confuse 'ab' with 'a+b', a persistent misconception in lower sets. By Year 11, higher-tier students handle this easily, but foundation-tier students still frequently struggle with the invisible multiplication sign and the priority of that multiplication over the initial addition.</explanation>
