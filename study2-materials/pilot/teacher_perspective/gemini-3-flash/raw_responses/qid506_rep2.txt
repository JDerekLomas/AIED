<explanation>The most common error is option A. Students see the 3 and the 12 and instinctively perform the operation 12 ÷ 3 because they are used to the answer being a 'nicer' integer or a simpler fraction. They fail to apply the formal inverse operation of dividing both sides by 3 (or multiplying by 1/3). Another significant cohort will choose C, simply multiplying 3 by 12 and ignoring the fractional structure entirely. Even high-achieving GCSE students often rush this and treat the 3 as a divisor of the denominator rather than a multiplier of it.</explanation>
