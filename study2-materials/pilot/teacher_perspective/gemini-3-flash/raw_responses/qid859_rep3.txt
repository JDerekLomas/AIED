<explanation>The most common error is failing to use inverse operations when moving terms across the equals sign. For option A (d=0), students often subtract 6d from 12d to get 6d, but then mistakenly add the -3 and +3 on the right side (3 + 3 = 6), leading to 6d = 6; however, a significant subset simply sees the -3 and +3 and assumes they "cancel out" to zero, leading to 6d = 0. Option D is also a common distractor for students who correctly reach 6d = 2 (by incorrectly subtracting 3 from 5 or similar arithmetic slips) or who get the division upside down (3/9 or 2/6).</explanation>
