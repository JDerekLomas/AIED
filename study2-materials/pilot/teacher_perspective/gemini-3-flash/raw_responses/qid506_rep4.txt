<explanation>The most common error is choosing Option A (p=1/4). This stems from the misconception that they should perform the operation they "see" or find easiest rather than the inverse. Students see a 3 and a 12 and immediately think of division (12 ÷ 3 = 4), leading them to 1/4. Even those who understand they need to divide by 3 often struggle with the division of a fraction, mistakenly "cancelling" the 3 into the 12 (multiplication instead of division of the denominator) or simply confusing the relationship between the whole number and the fraction's denominator.</explanation>
