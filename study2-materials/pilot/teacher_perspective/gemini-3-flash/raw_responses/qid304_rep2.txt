<explanation>The most common error is the "left-to-right" bias. Many students read a mathematical expression like a sentence and assume the operations must be performed in the order they appear. Even students who can recite the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym often fail to apply it when the addition (A) appears at the very start of the string, as the visual pull of '1 + 2' is incredibly strong. Some students may also choose B if they have a partial understanding of BIDMAS (knowing multiplication comes before addition) but neglect the priority of the brackets entirely.</explanation>
