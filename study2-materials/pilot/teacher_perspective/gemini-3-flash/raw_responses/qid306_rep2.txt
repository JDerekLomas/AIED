<explanation>The primary misconception stems from a rigid, literal interpretation of the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym. For Problem P, many students believe addition must always come before subtraction because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym (leading them to incorrectly pick C or D). However, the most prevalent error across both problems is "left-to-right processing" regardless of operators. In Problem Q, students frequently succumb to the "Addition before Multiplication" error (picking A or C) because they read the expression like a sentence. Option A is the most common wrong answer because it represents the most basic intuitive approach: simply working from left to right in both instances, ignoring the hierarchy of operations entirely.</explanation>
