<explanation>The most persistent error is the 'Freshman's Dream' or distributive misconception (Option B), where students simply square the x and square the -3, completely omitting the middle term (-6x). Regarding the specific misconception mentioned in the prompt (Option A), students often struggle with the directed number rule that 'a negative times a negative equals a positive', particularly when they are already mentally fatigued by the process of FOIL/expanding. Year 7 and 8 students often haven't been formally introduced to binomial expansion, leading to very high error rates, while Year 11s still frequently drop the middle term or make sign errors under exam pressure.</explanation>
