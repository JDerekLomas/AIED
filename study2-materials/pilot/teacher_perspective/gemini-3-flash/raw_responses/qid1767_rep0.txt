<explanation>The most common error is choosing Option D (-7). This stems from a 'pattern matching' misconception where students see the minus sign in the expression (x - 7) and believe they must perform that same operation to 'move' or 'deal with' the number. They fail to understand the concept of inverse operations required to isolate the variable. In Year 7 and 8, many students also confuse the notation and might select B or C if they have a weak grasp of the relationship between operations, but D remains the dominant distractor across all age groups because it mimics the sign already present in the equation.</explanation>
