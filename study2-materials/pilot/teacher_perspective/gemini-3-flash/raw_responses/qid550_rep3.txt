<explanation>The most common error stems from a rigid, literal interpretation of BIDMAS/BODMAS. Many students believe that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, addition must always be performed first. Consequently, they calculate Tom's left side as (3+2)-1=4 and the right side as 3-(1+2)=0, leading them to believe Tom is incorrect. Furthermore, many students struggle with the concept of commutativity when it involves subtraction, failing to see that the sign belongs to the number following it. Katie's example is often seen as 'more' correct because it looks like a standard swap, but the confusion over Tom's statement usually drives the wrong choice.</explanation>
