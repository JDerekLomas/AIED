<explanation>The most common error is the "division by the smaller number" misconception. When students see 20 and 5, they instinctively divide 20 by 5 to get 4 (Option B), regardless of the algebraic structure. Furthermore, many students struggle with the concept that the solution to an equation can be a fraction less than 1; they assume the variable must be an integer. Option C and D are less common but attract students who confuse the inverse operation of subtraction (adding 5) with the sign of the final result.</explanation>
