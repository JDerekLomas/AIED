<explanation>This is one of the most persistent misconceptions in secondary mathematics. Students have "negative times a negative equals a positive" so deeply ingrained that they automatically apply it here. They fail to understand that the calculator follows BIDMAS/BODMAS strictly: the indices (squaring) take priority over the subtraction/negation. Therefore, the calculator treats it as -(6^2) rather than (-6)^2. Even high-attaining Year 11 students frequently fall into this trap because they intuit the expression as "negative six, squared" rather than "the negative of six-squared." Option A and B are less common, usually chosen by students who confuse squaring with multiplying by two.</explanation>
