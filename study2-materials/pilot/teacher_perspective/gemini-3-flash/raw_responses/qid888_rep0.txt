<explanation>The most common error is a negative number arithmetic misconception. While many students correctly use 'FOIL' or the grid method to find the terms m^2, 7m, 5m, and 35, they struggle with the signs. Specifically, students often correctly calculate -5m - 7m = -12m, but then fail on the final term, incorrectly believing that -5 multiplied by -7 is -35. This leads them to choose option D. Option A is a common error for students who subtract the coefficients (7-5) instead of adding two negatives, while option C is chosen by students who ignore the negative signs entirely.</explanation>
