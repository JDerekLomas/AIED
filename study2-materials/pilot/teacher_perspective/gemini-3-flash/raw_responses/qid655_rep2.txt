<most_common_wrong_answer>C</most_common_wrong_answer>
<explanation>This question is deceptively difficult because it combines three high-error areas: negative number arithmetic, fractional answers (non-integer results), and the "order" of division. 

The most common wrong answer is C because students correctly identify that the missing number must be positive to result in a negative product (-6 * +x = -8), but then they instinctively divide the larger absolute value by the smaller one (8 ÷ 6) and erroneously re-apply a negative sign because they see negatives in the question. 

Many students will also choose B or C because they struggle with the algebraic step of dividing -8 by -6, often confusing the rule "a negative times a negative is a positive" with the visual appearance of the numbers. Finally, students frequently get the fraction upside down (6/8 vs 8/6) because they assume they should divide the coefficient by the answer rather than the other way around.</explanation>
