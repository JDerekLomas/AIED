<explanation>The most common error is the 'add everything' strategy (Option D), where students correctly add the whole numbers and the numerators, but incorrectly add the denominators (5 + 5 = 10). This stems from a lack of understanding that the denominator represents the size of the parts, not a quantity to be summed. Option B is a 'distractor' for students who correctly calculate the value but fail to follow the instruction to leave it as a mixed number, though it is mathematically equivalent. Option C represents a complete failure of fraction arithmetic logic, adding both numerators and denominators without considering the whole numbers.</explanation>
