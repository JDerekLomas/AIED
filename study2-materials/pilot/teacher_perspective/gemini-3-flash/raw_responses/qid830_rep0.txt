<explanation>The most common error is failing to use inverse operations correctly. After substituting x = 0.3, students get 0.6 + 3y = 12. Many students will subtract 0.6 to get 11.4, but then struggle with 11.4 ÷ 3. However, the specific misconception highlighted (using the same operation) leads students to Option C: they calculate 2(0.3) = 0.6, then instead of subtracting 0.6 from 12, they incorrectly "add" or misapply the relationship, often arriving at 12.6 ÷ 3 = 4.2. Additionally, the decimal 0.3 often causes cognitive load issues, leading students to guess or make arithmetic slips. Option A (4.1) is also a common distractor for students who subtract 0.6 to get 11.4 but then perform the division 12.3 / 3 or similar place-value errors.</explanation>
