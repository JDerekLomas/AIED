<explanation>This is one of the most persistent misconceptions in secondary mathematics. Students almost universally believe that squaring a negative number results in a positive answer because "two negatives make a plus." They fail to realise that scientific calculators follow BIDMAS/BODMAS strictly: the index (Indices) is applied to the 6 before the subtraction/negative sign (Subtraction) is considered. Therefore, the calculator evaluates it as -(6x6). Even high-attaining Year 11 students frequently fall into this trap unless they have been explicitly taught how the calculator processes the syntax versus how they might write it by hand with brackets.</explanation>
