<explanation>The most prevalent error is confusing the y-intercept with the x-intercepts (roots). Students see the numbers 8 and 6 and immediately associate them with the coordinates, often forgetting to flip the signs or, more crucially, confusing which axis is which (Option B). For those who do understand they need to find the constant term by multiplying -8 and -6, a significant number will make a sign error, leading them to Option D (-48). In Year 7 and 8, the concept of a quadratic graph is largely unfamiliar, so most will guess or incorrectly add the numbers (Option A).</explanation>
