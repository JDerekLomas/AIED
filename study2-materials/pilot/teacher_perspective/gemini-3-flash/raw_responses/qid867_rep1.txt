<explanation>The most pervasive error is 'squaring the components' (Option B), where students simply square the x and square the -4, completely omitting the middle term (-8x). While the specific misconception noted is the sign of the constant (Option D), Option B remains the dominant error across all year groups due to a lack of understanding that (x-4)^2 means (x-4)(x-4). Option D is chosen by students who correctly identify the need for a middle term via FOIL/Grid method but fail on the integer multiplication of (-4) * (-4), erroneously believing a negative multiplied by a negative stays negative.</explanation>
