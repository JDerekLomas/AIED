<explanation>The most common error (Option A) stems from students applying the operation shown in the expression rather than the inverse. Instead of subtracting 1 from both sides, they add 1 (-5 + 1 = -4, 5 + 1 = 6 is a common step, but often they simply 'do' the addition to the numbers: 5+4 and 5+6). More specifically, Option A results from students adding 1 to 5 and 10, then multiplying by 2. Option C is a common 'guess' where students simplify the bounds to a symmetrical range. Year 7 and 8 students typically haven't encountered three-part inequalities, leading to very high error rates. Even at GCSE (Year 11), the 'double-sided' nature of the inequality causes students to only apply the operation to one side or perform the inverse operation incorrectly.</explanation>
