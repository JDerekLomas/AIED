<explanation>The most common error is the 'operation mimicry' seen in Step 2. Students correctly identify that they need to move the 1 (Step 1 is often handled well because the multiplication is intuitive), but then they see a plus sign and instinctively add 1 to 60 to get 61, rather than performing the inverse operation of subtraction. Many students also struggle with the 'Is it correct?' format; they often assume that if a student has provided a multi-step solution in a question, it is likely to be correct unless they find a glaring arithmetic error. Lower ability students frequently confuse 'changing the side' with 'keeping the operation'.</explanation>
