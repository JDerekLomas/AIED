<explanation>The most frequent error occurs when students multiply the constant terms (-3 and -2). Many students correctly identify that 3 x 2 = 6, but they either believe that "a negative and a negative make a negative" (misapplying addition rules to multiplication) or they simply lose track of the sign during the expansion process. Option D is the most common distractor because it correctly handles the middle term (-3m - 2m = -5m) but fails on the final sign. Option B is also a common error for students who struggle with directed number addition (-3 + -2 resulting in -1), but at Key Stage 4, the sign of the constant term is the most persistent "slip" even among higher-ability students.</explanation>
