<explanation>The primary misconception here is twofold: First, students frequently believe that a zero in a data set "doesn't count," leading them to divide by 4 instead of 5 (Option C). This is the most prevalent error across all year groups. Second, students with weak BIDMAS/order of operations knowledge may select Option B, failing to realise that without brackets or a fraction bar, only the 7 is being divided by 5. Option A is often viewed with suspicion by lower-ability students because the zero is "missing" from the numerator, even though its inclusion wouldn't change the sum.</explanation>
