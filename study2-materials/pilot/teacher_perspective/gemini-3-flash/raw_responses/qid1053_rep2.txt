<explanation>The high error rate in younger years is due to quadratic factorisation not being part of the standard KS3 curriculum for many, leading to guessing. For Year 10 and 11, the primary error is 'sign confusion'. Students often correctly identify the factors of 6 as 3 and 2, but struggle with the directed number arithmetic required to sum to -1. Option D is the most common distractor because students see the negative sign in the expression and associate it with the smaller number, or they incorrectly calculate +3 - 2 as -1. Option B is also a common trap for students who forget that two negatives must multiply to a positive constant term.</explanation>
