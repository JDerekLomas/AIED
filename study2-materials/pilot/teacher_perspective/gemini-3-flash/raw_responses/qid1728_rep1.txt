<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students typically read the expression from left to right, performing the subtraction first: (3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4). They then multiply this result by 1/5 (2/4 * 1/5 = 2/20), which simplifies to 1/10 (Option B). This error is incredibly persistent because students often view fractions as a 'topic' separate from general arithmetic rules. Even higher-ability students frequently default to left-to-right processing when faced with multi-step fraction arithmetic. Option A is a common secondary error where students subtract both numerators and denominators (3-1=2, 4-4=0 or 16), showing a fundamental lack of fraction fluency.</explanation>
