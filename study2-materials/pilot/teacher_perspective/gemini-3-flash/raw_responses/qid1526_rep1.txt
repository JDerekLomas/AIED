<explanation>The most common error is the 'add across' misconception (Option C: 3+2=5 and 5+7=12). This is an incredibly persistent intuitive error where students treat the numerator and denominator as independent integers rather than parts of a single value. Younger students (Year 7-8) frequently default to this when they forget the algorithm for a common denominator. Option A is a common calculation error during the 'cross-multiplication' process (subtracting instead of adding), while Option D represents a partial understanding where the denominator is correct but the numerators are simply added without scaling.</explanation>
