<explanation>The most common error is failing to use inverse operations correctly, specifically with the constants. Many students see '+2' and '-5' and instinctively combine them to get '-3' (leading to option A) or mistakenly subtract 2 from 3 to get 1 (leading to option B). Option B is particularly common because students often struggle when the variable appears on both sides; they may subtract 3n from 4n to get 'n' correctly, but then erroneously subtract 5 from 2 (getting -3) or 2 from 3 (getting 1) due to a lack of systematic step-by-step manipulation. Additionally, some students who reach '7 &gt;= n' may reflexively flip the inequality sign when moving the variable to the left, leading them to choose D.</explanation>
