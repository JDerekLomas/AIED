<explanation>This question is deceptively difficult because it combines negative number arithmetic with fractional outcomes. 

The most common error is choosing C (-8/6). Many students correctly identify that the missing value must involve 8 and 6, but they struggle with two main areas: 
1. Sign rules: Students often remember "a negative and a negative make a positive" but misapply it, thinking that because the target is -8, they must multiply by another negative. 
2. Division order: Many students instinctively put the smaller number on top (Option B) or get confused when the division doesn't result in an integer. 

In Year 7 and 8, many students will guess A or B because they are uncomfortable with improper fractions. By Year 11, while sign rules are better understood, the pressure of a non-calculator context still leads to a high frequency of 'sign-flipping' errors.</explanation>
