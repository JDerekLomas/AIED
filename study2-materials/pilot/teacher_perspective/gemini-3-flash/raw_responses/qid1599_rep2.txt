<explanation>The most common error is option C, driven by a 'left-to-right' processing bias where students translate 'c divided by h' into a fraction first and then simply append the '+4' at the end, neglecting the brackets which indicate the entire expression (h+4) is the divisor. Option D is also a frequent 'distractor' for students who understand the fraction bar represents division but struggle with the spatial orientation of the numerator and denominator (the 'dividend/divisor' relationship).</explanation>
