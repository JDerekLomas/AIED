<explanation>The primary hurdle is the multi-step nature of BIDMAS/order of operations combined with directed numbers. Option B is frequently missed because students calculate -28 - (-8) and incorrectly resolve the double negative to a negative, or calculate -28 - 8 = -36. However, Option C is the most common distractor because students often believe (-5)² is -25 (a very common calculator/mental error), leading them to -25 + 5 = -20. Option A is also a strong distractor for those who struggle with the sign of the product of -4 and 4.</explanation>
