<explanation>The most common error is the 'add everything' strategy (Option C), where students apply the same logic to the denominators as they do to the numerators (2+3 and x+x). This is a fundamental misconception rooted in numerical fractions that persists into algebraic fractions. Option D is also common for students who confuse the rules of addition with the rules of multiplication. Year 7 and 8 students often struggle with this specific question because they are simultaneously grappling with the concept of 'like terms' in algebra and the rules of fraction arithmetic; many feel that an 'x' must be combined with another 'x' to become '2x' or 'x^2' regardless of the operation.</explanation>
