<explanation>The most common error (Option B) stems from two main issues: first, the 'bigger number divided by smaller number' intuition, where students reflexively calculate 12 ÷ 3 rather than 3 ÷ 12. Second, as noted in the misconception focus, many students struggle with the final step of a linear equation when the coefficient is larger than the constant, mistakenly applying subtraction or incorrect division order. Option A is also a frequent distractor for students who confuse the sign change when moving the -3 across the equals sign, or who believe the answer must be negative because they are 'taking away'.</explanation>
