<explanation>The most prevalent error is the sign mistake. Students frequently remember that 4 x 3 = 12, but struggle with the rule for multiplying two negative integers, leading them to choose B (-12). In lower year groups (Year 7 and 8), many students also confuse multiplication with addition, leading them to choose D (-7) or A (+7) because they are "combining" the numbers rather than finding the product. By Year 11, while most understand the expansion process, a significant minority still make "slip" errors with negative signs under exam pressure.</explanation>
