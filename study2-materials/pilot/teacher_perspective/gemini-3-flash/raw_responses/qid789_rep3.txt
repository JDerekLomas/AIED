<explanation>There are two distinct hurdles in this question. The first is the conceptual misconception of adding the denominators (leading to Option A), which is very common in lower years. However, the most significant "trap" for older or more capable students is the instruction to "Write your answer in its simplest form." Many students will correctly calculate 8/10 but fail to simplify it to 4/5, leading them to choose Option B. In my experience, even high-achieving Year 11s often lose marks by neglecting the final simplification step under exam pressure.</explanation>
