<explanation>The most common error is a failure to correctly invert the fraction (the 1/2). Many students see the 2 and instinctively want to move it to the denominator of the other side (Option C), essentially treating the operation as multiplication by 2 rather than division by 2. Option A is chosen by students who lack an understanding of 'changing the subject' and simply reorder the variables. Lower ability students also struggle with the fractional coefficient, often forgetting that multiplying by 1/2 is the same as dividing by 2, leading to errors in the inverse operation required to isolate h.</explanation>
