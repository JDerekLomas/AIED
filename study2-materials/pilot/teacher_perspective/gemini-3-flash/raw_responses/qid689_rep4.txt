<explanation>The most common error is the 'commutative misconception' where students see the numbers 10 and 5 and automatically perform 10 ÷ 5 because they are conditioned to divide the larger number by the smaller number, leading to Option C (p=2). Many students also struggle with equations where the unknown is the denominator; they often incorrectly 'move' the 5 by multiplying (leading to Option B, p=50) or simply guess that 5 divided by something cannot be 10, leading to confusion. Option C is the dominant distractor because it mimics the structure of 10 = p × 5 or 10 ÷ 5 = p.</explanation>
