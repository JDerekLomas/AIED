<explanation>The most significant error here is the fundamental misconception that "a negative and a negative make a negative." Many students see the minus signs in the question and the minus sign in the result (-24 or -8) and assume the calculation is correct because they are "staying in the negatives." Option C is the most common distractor because students often focus on the numerical relationships (3 x 8 = 24 and 24 / 3 = 8) and the visual representation of the arrows pointing left (negative direction), leading them to believe both statements are logically sound without strictly applying the formal rules for multiplying and dividing directed numbers. Even higher-ability students often rush and fail to verify the sign of the product/quotient.</explanation>
