<explanation>The most common error is choosing option D (3/14). This stems from a 'whole number' intuition where students apply the addition operation to both the numerators and the denominators independently. Even though students are taught that the denominator represents the size of the 'parts' and should remain constant when denominators are the same, the procedural pull of 7+7=14 is very strong, especially for students with lower attainment or those working under time pressure. Option B is a rarer error associated with confusing addition rules with multiplication rules.</explanation>
