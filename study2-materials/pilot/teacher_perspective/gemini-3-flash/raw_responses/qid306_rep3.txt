<explanation>The primary misconception is a rigid adherence to the 'Left-to-Right' rule for all calculations, leading students to choose Option A. While Year 7 students are often taught BIDMAS/BODMAS, they frequently struggle with the hierarchy of operations when mixed with addition and subtraction. Many students also fall into the trap of Option D because they misinterpret the 'A' (Addition) coming before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, believing they must always add before they subtract, even though they are of equal priority. However, the most prevalent error in a 'mixed' question like this is simply processing the numbers in the order they appear (Reading Order), which makes Option A the most frequent distractor across all year groups.</explanation>
