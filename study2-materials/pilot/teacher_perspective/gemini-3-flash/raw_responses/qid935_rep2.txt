<explanation>The most common error (leading to answer C) occurs because students often fail to use the inverse operation correctly when dealing with negative results. A student will substitute k=8 to get 2j - 8 = -10. Instead of adding 8 to both sides, they may subtract 8 from -10 (getting -18) or simply lose track of the signs, leading to 2j = -18, hence j = -9. Additionally, many students struggle with the cognitive load of "half-finished" simultaneous equations, often trying to perform operations on the -10 and 8 without formal substitution steps.</explanation>
