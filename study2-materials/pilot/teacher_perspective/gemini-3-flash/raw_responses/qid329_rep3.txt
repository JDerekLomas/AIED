<explanation>The primary reason for incorrect answers is the 'left-to-right' bias. Many students ignore BIDMAS/BODMAS when decimals are involved, as the cognitive load of the numbers distracts them from the order of operations. Students choosing B (Katie) often believe that because subtraction appears first in the expression, it must be performed first (0.1 - 0.2), and then they see Katie's reordering as a way to 'fix' the negative result they anticipate. Additionally, many students struggle with the commutative property, wrongly believing subtraction can be reordered like addition.</explanation>
