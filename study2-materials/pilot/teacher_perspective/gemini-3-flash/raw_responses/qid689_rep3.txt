<explanation>The most common error is answer C (p=2). Students instinctively see the numbers 10 and 5 and perform the operation 10 ÷ 5 because they are conditioned to divide the larger number by the smaller number. They often fail to recognise that the variable is the divisor. Even higher-ability students often fall into the trap of "solving" it as 5p = 10 rather than 10p = 5. Answer B (p=50) is also common among students who see 'divide by p' and decide to multiply the two visible constants (10 * 5) regardless of their positions in the equation.</explanation>
