<explanation>The most common error is the 'Left-to-Right' misconception (Option B), where students treat mathematics like reading a sentence. Even though BIDMAS/BODMAS is taught early in secondary school, many students revert to chronological processing under pressure. A smaller cohort chooses Option A because they have been taught 'Addition comes before Subtraction' in the acronym (AS), leading them to incorrectly believe addition must always be performed first even when it is at the end of the expression. Option D is rarely chosen by this age group as they generally recognize math has specific rules, even if they can't recall them correctly.</explanation>
