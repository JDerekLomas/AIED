<explanation>The most common error is choosing B (-4/3). Students often correctly identify the need for the reciprocal to reach a magnitude of 1, but they apply a "matching" rule to the sign rather than a multiplicative one. They see a negative result and a negative starting term and instinctively feel the missing term should also be negative. Furthermore, many students confuse the rules for perpendicular gradients (negative reciprocals) with the identity for 1, or they simply fail to process that "negative times negative equals positive." In Year 7 and 8, many students struggle to even identify 4/3 as the reciprocal, often choosing C or D because they find fraction multiplication non-intuitive.</explanation>
