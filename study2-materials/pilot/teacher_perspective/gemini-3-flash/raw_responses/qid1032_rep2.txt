<explanation>The most common error is the "left-to-right" misconception (Option A), where students ignore the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and simply process the numbers as they read them: 5 + 4 = 9, then 9 × 3 = 27. Despite being taught order of operations early in Key Stage 3, many students revert to left-to-right processing under pressure or when they haven't achieved fluency. Option C represents a double error (adding then multiplying incorrectly), while Option D is a rarer calculation slip.</explanation>
