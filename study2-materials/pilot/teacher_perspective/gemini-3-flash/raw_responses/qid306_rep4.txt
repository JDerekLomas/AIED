<explanation>The primary misconception is a rigid 'left-to-right' processing bias, leading students to select Option A. In Problem P, many students correctly identify that addition and subtraction have equal priority and work left-to-right. However, the same 'reading order' logic is incorrectly applied to Problem Q, where they ignore the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule that multiplication takes precedence over addition. A secondary misconception (Option D) occurs among students who over-apply the acronym, believing 'Addition' (A) must always come before 'Subtraction' (S) in Problem P because of the letter order in BIDMAS.</explanation>
