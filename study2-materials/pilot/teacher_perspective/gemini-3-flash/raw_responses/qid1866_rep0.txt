<explanation>The most common error is a "left-to-right" processing bias where students ignore the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students calculate 8 - 7 = 1, then 1 + 10 = 11, and finally 11 × 3 = 33 (Option D). Another common error involves performing the addition before the subtraction (7 + 30 = 37, then 8 - 37 = -29), stemming from a literal interpretation of the 'A' coming before 'S' in BIDMAS, leading to Option C. However, the simple linear calculation is the most frequent mistake seen in UK classrooms under exam pressure.</explanation>
