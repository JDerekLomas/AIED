<explanation>The primary hurdle is the double negative. Students often correctly substitute to get '10 - 2(-2)', but then apply the 'two negatives make a positive' rule inconsistently. Many students calculate 2 * -2 = -4, but then perform 10 - 4 to get 6 (Option B), failing to see that subtracting a negative is equivalent to addition. Option A (-12) is common among lower-ability students who ignore the 10 and do -2 - 10, or perform 10 - 2 = 8 then 8 * -2. Option D (32) occurs when students concatenate the numbers (10 - 22) or perform (10-2)*-2 incorrectly. Even in Year 11, the '10 - 4' error persists under exam pressure.</explanation>
