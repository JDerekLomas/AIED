<explanation>The most common error stems from a failure to apply the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students see "1 - 3n" and perform the subtraction first: (1 - 3) = -2, then multiply by 15 to get -30 (Option D), or more commonly, they misinterpret the expression entirely by calculating (1 - 3) = -2 and then adding 15, or simply making a sign error in the substitution. However, Option C (-14) is a very frequent distractor because students calculate 1 - 3(15) but process it as (1 - 3) * 15 or they calculate 1 - 15 = -14, ignoring the coefficient of n. In my experience, many students also struggle with the negative result, leading them to subtract 1 from 45 instead of 45 from 1, resulting in 44 or -46 (Option B) due to poor number line fluency.</explanation>
