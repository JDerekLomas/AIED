<explanation>The most prevalent error is the "Freshman's Dream" misconception, where students simply square the individual terms inside the bracket (x² and (-4)²), leading them to answer B or C. While this specific question targets the sign of the constant (Option D), in a real classroom setting, Option B is the most frequent error because students forget the middle term (-8x) entirely. Among students who do attempt a full expansion, the negative multiplied by a negative resulting in a negative is a persistent error, especially under exam pressure, leading them to Option D.</explanation>
