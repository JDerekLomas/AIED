<explanation>The primary reason for incorrect answers is a failure to manage the signs correctly when dealing with reciprocals. Many students correctly identify that they need the reciprocal (4/3) to get a numerical magnitude of 1, but they apply the 'negative times something must be negative' logic incorrectly, leading them to choose Option B (-4/3). This is often due to a superficial memory of 'negative signs' being associated with 'negative results'. Furthermore, lower ability students often confuse the rules for multiplying fractions with the rules for adding them, or they mistakenly look for the additive inverse (3/4) rather than the multiplicative inverse.</explanation>
