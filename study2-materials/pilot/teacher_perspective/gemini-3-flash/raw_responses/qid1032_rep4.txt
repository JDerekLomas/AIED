<explanation>The most common error is the "left-to-right" misconception (Option A), where students ignore the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and simply calculate 5 + 4 = 9, then 9 × 3 = 27. Despite being taught the priority of multiplication over addition from Year 6 onwards, many students default to reading a mathematical expression like a sentence. Even at GCSE level (Years 10-11), under pressure or when not prompted to think about order, a significant minority of students still revert to this intuitive but incorrect linear processing.</explanation>
