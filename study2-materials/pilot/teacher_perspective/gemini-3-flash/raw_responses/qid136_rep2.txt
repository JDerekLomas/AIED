<explanation>The most common error is choosing Option A due to the misconception that "a negative and a negative make a negative." Students often over-generalise the rules for adding negative numbers (where -3 + -8 = -11) or simply associate the presence of negative signs in the question with negative signs in the answer without applying the multiplicative rules. Option C is a common distractor for students who confuse "product" with "sum," while Option D is chosen by those with weak mental arithmetic. Even at GCSE level (Year 10/11), a significant minority of students revert to these errors under time pressure or when they haven't fully internalised the sign rules.</explanation>
