<explanation>The primary hurdle is the combination of decimal arithmetic and two-step algebraic manipulation. Most students correctly substitute x = 0.3 to get 0.6 + 3y = 12. However, the most common error (leading to answer C) occurs when students subtract 0.6 from 12 to get 11.4, but then perform a division by 3 incorrectly or use an additive inverse logic. Specifically, many students see 12.6 / 3 = 4.2 and choose C because they mistakenly add 0.6 to 12 instead of subtracting it. Answer A (4.1) is also common among students who struggle with the division of 11.4 by 3, often simply dividing the 12 by 3 and adding/subtracting the 0.3.</explanation>
