<explanation>The most common error (Option B) stems from the persistent misconception that fractions can be added by simply adding the numerators (3+4=7) and the denominators (2x+x=3x). This "add across" error is common in numerical fractions and often resurfaces when algebra is introduced. Option D is the second most common error, where students correctly identify the common denominator of 2x but fail to adjust the second numerator (4) accordingly, simply adding the existing numerators. Year 7 and 8 students struggle significantly as algebraic fractions are often not introduced until late KS3/early KS4 for higher sets, making the "x" in the denominator highly intimidating.</explanation>
