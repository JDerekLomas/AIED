<explanation>The most common error is selecting Option A because it follows the chronological order of the sentence (add 5, then multiply by 4) without accounting for the rules of BIDMAS/BODMAS. Students often read mathematical sentences from left to right like text. Option B is also a frequent distractor for those who have begun to learn about algebraic notation (putting the coefficient in front of the variable) but fail to apply the multiplication to the entire sum. The use of brackets to group an addition before a multiplication is a significant threshold concept that many students struggle to internalise until late Key Stage 3 or early Key Stage 4.</explanation>
