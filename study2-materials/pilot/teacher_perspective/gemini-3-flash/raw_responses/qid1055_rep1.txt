<explanation>The most common error is the 'add across' misconception, where students treat the numerator and denominator as independent whole numbers. This leads them to calculate (3+1) and (5+4) to get 4/9 (Option A). This error is deeply rooted because it follows the logic of multiplication and the intuitive sense that 'addition makes things bigger' in a linear way. Option B (4/20) occurs when students find a common denominator but still add the original numerators, or mistakenly multiply the numerators. Option C (7/20) is less common but usually results from a botched attempt at the 'butterfly method' or cross-multiplication where one product is calculated incorrectly.</explanation>
