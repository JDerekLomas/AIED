<explanation>The most common error is a 'left-to-right' processing bias (Option A), where students treat the division as applying only to the first term of the denominator, failing to recognize that the vinculum in a fraction acts as a grouping symbol for the entire expression inside the parentheses. In Year 7 and 8, many students also struggle with the convention that 'ab' implies multiplication, often looking for a multiplication sign (Option D) or incorrectly attempting to factorise (Option B). By Year 11, while algebraic notation is better understood, a significant minority still struggle to translate horizontal BIDMAS/BODMAS structures into vertical fractional notation.</explanation>
