<explanation>The most common error is the 'Left-to-Right' bias. Despite knowing the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS, many students process the expression like a sentence. They see the outer brackets and then immediately jump to the first operation they encounter on the left (0.5 ÷ 0.2), failing to identify the 'nested' bracket as the highest priority. Additionally, the presence of decimals often increases the cognitive load, causing students to revert to simpler, incorrect heuristics rather than strictly following order of operations rules.</explanation>
