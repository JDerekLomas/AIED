<explanation>The most frequent error occurs when students multiply the constant terms (-3 and -2). Many students correctly identify that 3 times 2 is 6, and they correctly sum -3 and -2 to get -5m, but they fail to apply the 'negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive' rule, leading them to choose option D (-6). Year 7 and 8 students often struggle with the distributive property (FOIL/Grid method) itself, while older students in Years 10 and 11 typically make 'sign errors' under exam pressure, even if they understand the underlying rules of directed numbers.</explanation>
