<explanation>The most common error (leading to D) is a failure to understand the structure of the equation when a variable is zero. Students often see the numbers 3, 2, and 6 and perform a rote operation rather than substitution. Specifically, many students will multiply all the digits they see (3 * 2 * 2 = 12 or 3 * 2 + 6 = 12) or misinterpret the relationship between the coefficients. Option B is also a common 'distractor' where students simply pick the coefficient of y because x is 0. However, the specific misconception flagged (using the same operation instead of inverse) often manifests as students seeing '2y = 6' and thinking '2 times 6' or '6 plus 2' rather than '6 divided by 2'. In lower sets, many students struggle to move from the visual pattern of a table to the algebraic requirement of the equation.</explanation>
