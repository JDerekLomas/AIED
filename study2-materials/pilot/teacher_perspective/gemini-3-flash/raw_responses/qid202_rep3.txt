<explanation>The most common error in fraction addition across all key stages is the 'add across' misconception, where students add both the numerators and the denominators (2+1=3 and 5+5=10), leading to answer D. While some students may choose B (the correct value but in the wrong format), the instruction to leave it as a mixed number usually filters those out. Younger students (Year 7/8) often struggle with the concept that the denominator represents the size of the 'parts' and should remain constant when the units are the same.</explanation>
