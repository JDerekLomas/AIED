<explanation>This question is deceptively difficult because it combines three high-error areas: negative number arithmetic, fractional answers, and algebraic thinking. 

The most common error is C. Students often correctly identify that a negative multiplied by a positive results in a negative, but they then incorrectly apply the rule "negative times negative equals positive" in reverse, or simply lose track of the signs while rearranging. 

Furthermore, many students struggle with the concept of the multiplier being a fraction when the product is larger than the coefficient (in terms of absolute value). Many will instinctively choose A or B because they prefer "smaller number divided by larger number" (6/8). However, for those who understand the inverse operation is -8 divided by -6, the most frequent mistake is failing to simplify the two negatives into a positive, or getting the fraction the wrong way up.</explanation>
