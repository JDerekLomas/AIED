<explanation>The most common error (leading to option C) is a result of students substituting x = 0.3 to get 0.6 + 3y = 12, then subtracting 0.6 to get 3y = 11.4, but then incorrectly processing the final step. Instead of dividing 11.4 by 3 (inverse operation), students often try to "build" the number or perform an incorrect mental division where they see 12 divided by 3 is 4, and then incorrectly adjust for the 0.6. Specifically, students often calculate 12/3 = 4 and then simply add 0.6/3 = 0.2 to get 4.2, failing to realize they must subtract the 0.6 from the total first. Option A (4.1) is also common for students who subtract 0.3 instead of 0.6, or simply guess based on the proximity to 4.</explanation>
