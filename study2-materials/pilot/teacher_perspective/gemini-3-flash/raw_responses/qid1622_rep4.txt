<explanation>Students frequently struggle with equations where the variable is multiplied by a coefficient, especially when one term 'disappears' because it is multiplied by zero. 

The most common error (leading to D) is a 'number grabbing' approach: students see the 3, 2, and 2 (from the y) and perform a multiplication (3 * 2 * 2 = 12) or simply add the coefficients to the constant. 

Another significant group will choose B because they see the '2' in '2y' and assume that must be the value when x is 0, or they confuse the x-intercept with the coefficient of y. Option C is a common trap for those who correctly substitute x=0 to get 2y=6 but then subtract 2 from 6 (getting 4) or perform 6 divided by 4. 

In Year 7 and 8, many students haven't mastered the formal substitution into two-variable linear equations, often treating the '3x' and '2y' as separate entities rather than part of a balanced equation.</explanation>
