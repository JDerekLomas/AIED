<explanation>The most common error (leading to answer B) is the failure to handle the double negative correctly. Students often calculate 2 * -2 = -4, but then treat the expression as 10 - 4 rather than 10 - (-4). Another significant cohort will choose A by incorrectly applying the rule "a negative and a negative make a negative" to the multiplication, or by calculating 10 - 2 = 8 and then 8 * -2. Option D is a common 'concatenation' error where students replace d with -2 to see '10 - 2 - 2' or misinterpret the 2d as a positional notation, though this is less common by Year 11.</explanation>
