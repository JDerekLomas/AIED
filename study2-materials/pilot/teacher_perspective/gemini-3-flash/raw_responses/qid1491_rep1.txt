<explanation>The primary error is a conceptual misunderstanding of how exponents apply to negative bases. Many students believe that any power involving a negative number must result in a negative answer (Answer A). This is exacerbated by "calculator dependency"; if a student types -2^4 into a standard scientific calculator without brackets, the calculator correctly follows BIDMAS/BODMAS and outputs -16, leading students to believe this is the rule for (-2)^4. A smaller subset of students (Answers B and D) confuse exponentiation with multiplication (2 x 4), but by Year 10/11, the 'negative sign' error is the dominant reason for failure.</explanation>
