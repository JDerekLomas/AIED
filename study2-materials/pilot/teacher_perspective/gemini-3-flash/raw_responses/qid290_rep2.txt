<explanation>The primary misconception is two-fold. First, students often struggle with the order of operations (BIDMAS), incorrectly multiplying by 2 before squaring. Second, as identified, students frequently believe that squaring a negative number results in a negative product, leading them to choose C or D because they expect the result to be negative (e.g., thinking 2(-2)² - 1 becomes -8 - 1). Option B is often overlooked because many students hold the 'multiplication makes bigger' misconception and don't intuitively realise that squaring a proper fraction results in a smaller value (0.25), which is necessary for the expression to drop below zero.</explanation>
