<explanation>There are two distinct hurdles in this question. The first is the conceptual misconception of adding the denominators (leading to Option A), which is very common in lower years. However, the most frequent "wrong" answer across the board is actually Option B. This occurs because students correctly identify the rule for adding fractions with common denominators but fail to read the second part of the instruction: "Write your answer in its simplest form." In a high-stakes environment like GCSE, many Year 11s still lose marks by stopping at 8/10, considering the arithmetic "done" and neglecting the final simplification step.</explanation>
