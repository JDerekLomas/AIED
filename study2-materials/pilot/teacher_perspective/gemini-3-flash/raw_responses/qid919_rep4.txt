<explanation>The most common error stems from a failure to follow the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students frequently multiply 3 by 0.3 first to get 0.9, and then square the result to get 0.81 (Answer A). This is a classic "left-to-right" processing error where indices are ignored in favour of the immediate operation. Additionally, students often struggle with squaring decimals; many will calculate 0.3 squared as 0.9 rather than 0.09, leading to Answer D (3 * 0.9 = 2.7). In younger year groups, the combination of decimal arithmetic and algebraic substitution makes this a very high-difficulty task.</explanation>
