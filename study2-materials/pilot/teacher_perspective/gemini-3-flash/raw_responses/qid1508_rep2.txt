<explanation>The most common error is the 'Left-to-Right' misconception, where students ignore the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and simply process the numbers as they appear: 3+6=9, then 9/2=4.5, then 4.5+1=5.5 (Option C), or more frequently, they truncate or miscalculate the division to reach an integer. However, the most frequent "systematic" error leading to Option D is adding the 3+6 first, then dividing by the sum of 2+1 (9 ÷ 3 = 3), or more simply, performing 3+6=9, 9/2=4.5, and rounding or miscalculating to 5. In my experience, younger students almost instinctively read maths like a sentence from left to right, and even older students revert to this under time pressure or when they perceive the calculation as 'simple'. Option D often attracts students who mistakenly group the addition at the end or perform (3+6) / 2 + 1 roughly. However, Option C is the literal left-to-right result, but many students find decimals "messy" and gravitate toward the integer D.</explanation>
