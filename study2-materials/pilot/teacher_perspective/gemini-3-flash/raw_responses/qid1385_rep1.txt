<explanation>The most common error is the 'add across' misconception where students add all numerators (1+1+2+3=7) and all denominators (3+4+3+4=14), leading to Option B. While the question is designed to be easy if students spot the common denominators (1/3 + 2/3 = 1 and 1/4 + 3/4 = 1), many students have a 'procedure-first' mentality. They either default to the incorrect additive method or attempt to find a common denominator of 12 (Option D) but make arithmetic slips. Option B remains the dominant distractor, especially for lower-attaining students who treat the numerator and denominator as independent integers.</explanation>
