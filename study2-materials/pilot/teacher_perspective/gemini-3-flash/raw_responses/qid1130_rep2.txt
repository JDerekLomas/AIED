<explanation>The question requires students to first form the equation 10x + 30 = 180. The most common error (leading to answer D) occurs when students fail to use inverse operations. Instead of subtracting 30 from 180, they add 30, resulting in 10x = 210, hence x = 21. Younger students (Year 7-8) often struggle with the multi-step nature of the problem, frequently forgetting to sum the constants correctly or failing to equate the total to 180. Answer B is a common distractor for those who miscalculate the sum of the constants as 54 (42 + 12) rather than 30 (42 - 12).</explanation>
