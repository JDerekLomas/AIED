<explanation>The correct equation is 10x + 30 = 180, leading to 10x = 150 and x = 15. However, the misconception being tested involves using the same operation rather than the inverse. Students often see the +30 and decide to add it to 180 (getting 210) or see the -12 and +42 and incorrectly combine them or move them across the equals sign without reversing the sign. If a student calculates 10x = 180 + 30, they get 10x = 210, which leads to x = 21 (Option D). In lower year groups, many students will also struggle with the initial setup of the equation or basic algebraic simplification before they even reach the inverse operation stage.</explanation>
