<explanation>The most common error (leading to answer A) occurs because students substitute x=0 correctly to get 2y=10, but then perform the operation they see (multiplication) rather than the inverse (division), calculating 10 multiplied by 2 instead of 10 divided by 2. Another significant cohort of students will choose D (2.5) by incorrectly identifying the relationship as 4x = 10 (ignoring the 2y) or simply dividing 10 by 4. Year 7 and 8 students often struggle with the implicit multiplication in '2y' and the structure of a two-step equation presented within a table of values.</explanation>
