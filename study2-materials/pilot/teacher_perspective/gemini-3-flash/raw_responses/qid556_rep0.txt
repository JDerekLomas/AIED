<explanation>The most common error is choosing D (-9) because students see a positive 9 and believe they must 'take it away' to isolate the variable, failing to recognise that 9y represents multiplication. Another common error is choosing B (x9) because students simply repeat the operation they see implied in the expression (9 times y) rather than applying the inverse. In Year 7 and 8, the 'change the side, change the sign' rule is often misapplied to coefficients.</explanation>
