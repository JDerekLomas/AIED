<explanation>The most common error is failing to distribute the negative sign to the second term inside the bracket. Students often treat the '-' outside as simply belonging to the first term (the 2) rather than as a multiplier of -1 applied to the entire expression. Option B is the classic 'partial expansion' error. Option A is chosen by students who ignore the negative sign entirely, and Option C is chosen by those who correctly identify the sign change for the second term but forget to apply it to the first.</explanation>
