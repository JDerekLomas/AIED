<explanation>The most common error is option C, stemming from a 'visual' approach to rearrangement rather than inverse operations. Students often see the 1/2 and 'move' it next to the b in the denominator, effectively dividing by 2 instead of multiplying by 2. This is compounded by the misconception that to 'get rid' of a fraction, you simply place its components on the other side of the fraction bar. Option A is also common among lower-ability students who simply swap the letters A and h without performing any algebraic manipulation, a classic 'subject of the formula' misunderstanding.</explanation>
