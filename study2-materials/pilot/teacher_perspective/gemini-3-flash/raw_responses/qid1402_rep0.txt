<explanation>The primary issue is a 'left-to-right' reading bias. Many students read the expression 3 + ab like a sentence, leading them to Option C (3+a then multiply by b). This is compounded by a lack of fluency in the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically within an algebraic context, where the absence of a multiplication sign between 'a' and 'b' makes the multiplication less 'visible' than the addition. Students often fail to see 'ab' as a single term that must be evaluated before the addition.</explanation>
