<explanation>The most common error is selecting Option A because it follows the chronological order of the sentence (add 5, then multiply by 4) without accounting for the rules of BIDMAS/order of operations. Students often read mathematical sentences from left to right like a book, failing to realise that without brackets, the multiplication would happen before the addition. Option B is a common error for students who have begun to learn about coefficients (4n) but forget that the "add 5" was part of the initial sum to be multiplied. Many students also struggle with the "reverse" nature of forming equations from words, often trying to solve it mentally first and then picking an equation that "looks" like the steps they took.</explanation>
