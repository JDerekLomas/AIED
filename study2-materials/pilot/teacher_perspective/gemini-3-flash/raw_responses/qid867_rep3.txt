<explanation>The most prevalent error is the 'freshman's dream' misconception, where students simply square the individual terms inside the bracket (x² and (-4)²), leading them to option B. They fail to recognise that squaring a binomial requires multiplying the bracket by itself, which generates the middle term (-8x). Option D specifically targets the misconception mentioned in the prompt (multiplying two negatives to get a negative), but in my experience, the omission of the middle term entirely (Option B) is the most frequent error across all year groups, followed by Option C for those who confuse the expansion with the Difference of Two Squares.</explanation>
