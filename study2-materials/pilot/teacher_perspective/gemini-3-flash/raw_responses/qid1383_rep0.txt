<explanation>The most common error is C (-81) because students often fail to apply the rule that an even power of a negative number results in a positive product. Many students mentally calculate 3^4 = 81 and then simply 'reattach' the negative sign. This is exacerbated by the 'calculator error' where typing -3^4 without brackets yields -81. Option D is the secondary distractor for students who confuse indices with multiplication (k times 4).</explanation>
