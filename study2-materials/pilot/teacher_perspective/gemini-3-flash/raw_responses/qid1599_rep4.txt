<explanation>The most common error is C, stemming from a 'left-to-right' processing bias where students translate 'c divided by h' into a fraction first and then simply append the '+ 4' at the end, ignoring the brackets which signify that the entire expression (h+4) is the divisor. Option D is also a frequent 'distractor' for lower-ability students who confuse the numerator and denominator (dividend vs divisor) when converting from linear to fractional notation.</explanation>
