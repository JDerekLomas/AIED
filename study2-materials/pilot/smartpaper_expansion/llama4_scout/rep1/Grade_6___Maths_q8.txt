## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Requirements
The question asks for the area and perimeter of a rectangle with given length and breadth. The rubric specifically mentions correctly calculating the area as 120 sq. cm to score full marks. The formulas required are: Area = length * breadth and Perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth).

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors or Misunderstandings
Students might lose marks due to errors in calculation, incorrect application of formulas, or mistakes in units. For area: not multiplying length and breadth correctly or not using the correct units (sq. cm). For perimeter: incorrectly applying the formula or not doubling the sum of length and breadth.

## 3: Assessing Prerequisite Knowledge
The prerequisite knowledge needed includes understanding the formulas for the area and perimeter of a rectangle, being able to multiply and add numbers correctly, and knowing how to handle units (especially for area).

## 4: Evaluating Student Understanding at Grade 6 Level in India
By Grade 6 in India, students are typically expected to have a basic understanding of geometry, including formulas for perimeter and area of simple shapes like rectangles. They also learn to handle basic algebraic expressions and units.

## 5: Estimating the Proportion of Students Scoring Full Marks
Given that
