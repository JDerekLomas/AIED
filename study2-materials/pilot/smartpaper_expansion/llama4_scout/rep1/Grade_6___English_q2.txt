I'm assuming that the question refers to a specific story or context that has been studied in class, and that most students would recall that a fairy lived inside a book, probably from a well-known children's story. Given that, I estimate that about 70% of students would score full marks, as they would likely remember the detail correctly. Some students might misremember or not have read the relevant story, causing them to lose marks.
