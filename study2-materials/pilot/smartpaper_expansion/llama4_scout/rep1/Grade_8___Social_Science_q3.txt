0.7 

Rationale: 
The question is straightforward and requires a simple recall of a major factor influencing soil formation, which is a basic concept in Social Science (Geography) for Grade 8 students in India. The students at this level are likely to have been introduced to the topic of soil formation and its factors in their previous classes or in Grade 8 itself.

Given that the question allows for any one of several valid factors (parent rock, climate, relief/topography, organisms, or time), there's a good chance that a significant proportion of students will be able to recall at least one correct factor. 

The most common factor that might lead to losing marks could be either a blank answer or an irrelevant/invalid factor. However, assuming that these students have received adequate instruction, I consider a high proportion would be able to name a valid factor, hence the estimate of 0.7.
