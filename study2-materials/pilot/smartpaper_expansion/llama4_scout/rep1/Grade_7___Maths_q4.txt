## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks students to find the value of `8 ÷ 7.2` and provides a rubric that suggests converting the division to `80 ÷ 72` to remove the decimal is a correct setup for the division. The maximum score for this question is 0.5 marks.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
To solve this problem, students need to understand basic division operations, how to handle decimals in division, and possibly how to convert decimals to fractions or manipulate them to simplify calculations.

## 3: Consider common errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Not converting 7.2 to a fraction or to a form that eliminates the decimal (e.g., multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 10 to get `80 ÷ 72`).
- Performing the division directly with decimals without converting, which could lead to calculation errors.
- Understanding the concept of equivalent ratios in division.

## 4: Assess student knowledge at Grade 7 level in India
By Grade 7, Indian students are typically familiar with basic operations involving fractions and decimals, including conversions between them. However, their comfort with applying these concepts in division problems can vary.

## 5: Evaluate the clarity
