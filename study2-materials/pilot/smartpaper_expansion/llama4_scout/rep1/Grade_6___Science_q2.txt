My reasoning: 
The concept of photosynthesis is typically introduced in Grade 6 in Indian schools, and students are often familiar with the term and basic definition. However, losing marks could occur if students incorrectly spell "Photosynthesis," provide an incomplete definition, or do not specifically mention "Photosynthesis" (though not likely given the directness of the question). Additionally, identifying the plant part known as its 'kitchen' (typically the leaves, where photosynthesis primarily occurs) might add a minor challenge for some. Assuming these minor hiccups and based on general student performance at this level, a fairly optimistic proportion seems reasonable.
