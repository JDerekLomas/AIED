0.6 

My reasoning is as follows: 

The question seems straightforward and is based on a common narrative structure found in many fables or short stories, such as "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, which is commonly studied in Indian schools. The prerequisite knowledge required here is understanding the context where a king announces a reward, usually to provoke a response or achieve a particular goal. Given that this is a standard teaching narrative, most students at Grade 7 level are likely familiar with such stories.

However, potential errors or misunderstandings could arise from misinterpretation of the narrative or not recalling the specific reason related to "three questions." Some might provide an irrelevant reason (e.g., because he was generous) or fail to specify the connection to his questions, which would cause them to lose marks.

The clarity of the question and the assumption that students have prior exposure to such narratives lead me to estimate that approximately 60% of students could provide the correct reason to score full marks. This assumes there is some variation in students' comprehension and recall abilities. 

Thus, the estimated proportion is 0.6.
