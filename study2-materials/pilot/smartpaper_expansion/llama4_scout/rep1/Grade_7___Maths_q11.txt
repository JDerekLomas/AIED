To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks for this question, let's analyze the requirements and potential challenges.

The question requires students to:

1. Represent data on a bar graph.
2. Choose an appropriate scale.
3. Identify the class with the maximum and minimum number of children.

**Challenges and potential errors:**

- Drawing and labeling the graph: Students might struggle with properly labeling the X and Y axes or choosing a scale that is not suitable or consistent.
- Scale selection: Students might not understand how to select an appropriate scale or might make calculation errors.
- Identifying maximum and minimum: This part is relatively straightforward but requires accurate reading of the data.

**Prerequisite knowledge:**

- Basic understanding of bar graphs and their construction.
- Ability to read and interpret data.

**Grade level considerations:**

Students in Grade 7 in India are expected to have a basic understanding of graphs and data representation. However, the ability to construct a graph with a suitable scale and accurately identify maximum and minimum values can vary.

Given these considerations, I estimate that around 0.6 of students would manage to draw a correct graph, choose an appropriate scale, and accurately identify the classes with the maximum and minimum number of children, assuming clear instructions and some form of guidance on constructing bar
