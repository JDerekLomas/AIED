## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Requirements
The question requires students to calculate the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 pm, given that the temperature at 10:00 am is $30^0 C$ and it increases by $2^0 C$ per hour. To score full marks, students need to calculate the time elapsed from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm as 6 hours.

## 2: Identifying Prerequisite Knowledge
The prerequisite knowledge needed for this problem includes basic understanding of time calculation (to find the elapsed time) and the concept of linear increase in temperature over hours.

## 3: Assessing Potential Errors or Misunderstandings
Common errors could include miscalculating the elapsed time (e.g., not accounting for the full hours from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm, which could lead to answers like 5 hours or 7 hours), not understanding the rate of temperature increase, or making computational mistakes in calculating the final temperature.

## 4: Estimating Student Performance
Given that the students are in Grade 6, most are expected to have a basic understanding of time and simple arithmetic operations. However, the clarity of the question and the straightforward nature of the calculation (6
