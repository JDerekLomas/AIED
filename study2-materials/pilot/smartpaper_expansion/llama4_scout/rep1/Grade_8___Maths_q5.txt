## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question requires students to apply the distributive property to simplify the given expression: `{9/16 xx 4/12} + {9/16 xx (-3/9)}`. The rubric specifies that to get full marks, students must correctly apply the distributive property by taking out the common factor: `9/16 * (4/12 + (-3/9))`.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
To solve this problem, students need to have prior knowledge of the distributive property in mathematics, which states that for any numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$. Additionally, students must be comfortable working with fractions, including adding and multiplying them.

## 3: Assess the difficulty of applying the distributive property
Applying the distributive property in this context involves recognizing that $9/16$ is a common factor in both terms of the expression, and then factoring it out. This requires an understanding of how the distributive property can be applied in reverse, which is a relatively straightforward concept but may not be immediately obvious to all students.

## 4: Consider potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Not recognizing $9/
