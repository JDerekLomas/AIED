Here's my reasoning:

* The question assumes students have some knowledge of Rajasthan festivals, which might not be the case for all Grade 6 students. While they may have a general idea about festivals in India, specific festivals in Rajasthan might not be well-known.
* The question requires students to identify the festival from a picture (which is not provided), which may lead to errors if students are not familiar with the festival or the visual representation.
* Students might confuse Gangaur with other festivals or not know the correct spelling/name of the festival (e.g., Dhinga Gavar).
* A score of 0.5 is allocated for correctly identifying the festival name, which is a relatively low-stakes question. However, students still need to provide a brief description of how people celebrate the festival to get the full marks, which can lead to variable responses.

Based on these factors, I estimate that about 25% of students would score full marks, assuming they have prior knowledge of Rajasthan festivals and can accurately describe the celebrations.
