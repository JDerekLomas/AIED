Considering the students are in Grade 6 and studying in India, I would estimate that a significant portion of them would have basic knowledge of the major landforms in Rajasthan. However, there might be some students who:

- May not clearly recall the specific major landforms (Thar Desert or Aravalli Range).
- Could be confused with other geographical features or use incorrect names.
- Might not provide a brief, accurate description.

Assuming a fairly standard level of geographical awareness for this age group and the usual variations in learning and retention, I estimate around 0.7 of the students could correctly identify and describe one of the major landforms.
