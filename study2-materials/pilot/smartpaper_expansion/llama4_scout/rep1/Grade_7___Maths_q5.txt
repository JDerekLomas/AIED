## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks students to calculate how many Rupee `5` coins can be made from a given set of coins: `10` coins of `10` paise, `5` coins of `20` paise, and `16` coins of `50` paise. The rubric provides the correct steps to achieve full marks, which involves finding the total value of the given coins and implying the number of `5` Rupee coins that can be made from this total.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to understand the value of different denominations of coins in India, specifically that `100` paise = `1` Rupee. They also need to know how to perform basic arithmetic operations like multiplication and division.

## 3: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrect conversion between paise and Rupees (e.g., forgetting that `100` paise = `1` Rupee).
- Miscalculation of the total value of the coins.
- Failure to understand that the total value calculated can be directly used to find out how many `5` Rupee coins can be made.

## 4: Evaluate the clarity of the question
The question seems straightforward but
