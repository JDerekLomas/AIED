To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks, let's consider the complexity of the question and common misunderstandings.

1. **Understanding of Palindrome**: A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For a 5-digit number to be a palindrome, it must be of the form ABCBA.

2. **Identifying Smallest and Largest 5-digit Palindromes**: 
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is indeed 10,001.
   - The largest 5-digit palindrome is 99,999.

3. **Prerequisite Knowledge Needed**: 
   - Understanding what a palindrome is.
   - Basic addition and subtraction operations.

4. **Clear Communication of the Question**: 
   - The question clearly asks for the sum and difference of the smallest and largest 5-digit palindromes.

5. **Possible Errors**:
   - Not understanding what a palindrome is.
   - Misidentifying the smallest or largest 5-digit palindrome.
   - Incorrect addition or subtraction.

Given these points, the question seems straightforward and requires basic understanding and operations that are typically within the grasp of Grade 6 students in India, assuming they have a basic understanding of large numbers and operations.

However, common errors might include:
- Misidentifying
