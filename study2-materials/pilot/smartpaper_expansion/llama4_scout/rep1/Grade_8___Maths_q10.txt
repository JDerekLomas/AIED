To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks for the given question, let's analyze the several factors involved:

1. **Understanding of the Question**: The question requires identifying angle measures `x` and `y` in given figures (though the figures are not provided here, we can infer the type of problem typically involves using properties of angles in geometric shapes, like a triangle or a line intersecting two parallel lines). If the question clearly communicates what's expected and the figures are standard (e.g., simple geometric shapes), most students might understand what's required.

2. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: For a Grade 8 student in India, the prerequisite knowledge would include understanding basic geometric concepts (like types of angles: acute, obtuse, right; and properties of angles in a triangle, on a straight line, etc.). Given that the Indian mathematics curriculum for Grade 8 covers geometry and introduces students to properties of angles, most students are expected to have a grasp on finding angles using known properties.

3. **Specific Errors or Misunderstandings**: Common errors would include:
   - Misapplication of angle properties (e.g., incorrectly assuming all angles in a triangle are right angles).
   - Failure to identify relevant geometric properties (e.g., angles on a straight line add to
