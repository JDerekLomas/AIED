## Step 1: Understand the question and the required calculations
The question asks students to compare two values: `1/2` of `3/4` and `2/5` of `2/3`, and to show their calculations. To get full marks, students must correctly calculate both values: `1/2` of `3/4` is `3/8`, and `2/5` of `2/3` is `4/15`.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to have a basic understanding of fractions, including how to multiply fractions (`a/b` of `c/d` = `(a/b) * (c/d)`) and how to compare fractions.

## 3: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrectly calculating `1/2` of `3/4` as `1/2 * 3/4 = 3/6 = 1/2` instead of `3/8`.
- Incorrectly calculating `2/5` of `2/3` as `2/5 * 2/3 = 4/15` but not being able to compare it correctly to `3/8`.
- Difficulty in comparing
