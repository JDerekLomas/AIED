Most students at Grade 6 level in India would be familiar with the basic vocabulary and concept of antonyms. The question clearly asks for the opposite of "slow", and "fast" is a commonly known antonym. However, some students might not have a clear understanding of the concept or might provide incorrect antonyms such as "quickly" (which is an adverb) or might not be familiar with the word "fast" as an antonym, albeit a small proportion. Hence, I estimate that about 85% of students would score full marks.
