Given the context and requirements of the question, I estimate that approximately 0.8 of the students would score full marks.

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Specificity of the Question**: The question is straightforward and focused on a specific detail from a poem (not specified which poem, but presumably, it's a well-known one from their curriculum). The description of the squirrel's tail as having a "question mark" shape is quite unique and memorable.

2. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: The students are expected to have read and understood a poem where the squirrel's tail is described in such a manner. Given that this is a detail that can be recalled directly from the text, prior knowledge of the poem is essential.

3. **Potential Errors or Misunderstandings**: Errors might occur if students misread the poem, misunderstood the description, or if their version of the poem (perhaps online or in a different edition) used significantly different wording. 

4. **Grade Level Considerations**: Students in Grade 7 are typically proficient in reading comprehension and detail recall from their studied texts. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards in India emphasize detailed study of texts, making it plausible that a large proportion of students would be familiar with such a specific description.
