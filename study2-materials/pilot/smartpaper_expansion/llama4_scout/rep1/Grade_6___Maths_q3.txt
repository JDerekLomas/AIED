## Step 1: Understand the task
The task requires arranging the numbers 3367, 5492, 736, and 4799 in ascending order and specifically identifying the smallest number (736) and placing it first to score full marks for this part of the question.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
The prerequisite knowledge needed for this task is the ability to compare numbers and understand the concept of ascending order. Students should be able to identify the smallest and largest numbers in a given set.

## 3: Consider common errors or misunderstandings
Common errors could include misunderstanding the concept of ascending order, incorrectly comparing numbers (especially if they confuse the place value of digits), or simply making a careless mistake when arranging the numbers.

## 4: Assess student familiarity with the task
By Grade 6, most students in India are expected to have a solid grasp of basic mathematical operations including comparing numbers. However, the ability to apply this knowledge correctly can vary.

## 5: Evaluate the clarity of the question
The question is straightforward: "Arrange in ascending order: `3367, 5492, 736, 4799`". The task is clear, but it doesn't explicitly state how the answer should be formatted beyond the order.
