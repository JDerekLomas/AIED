I consider that the students have basic knowledge about the Himalayas and its significance. Given that the question requires only two points and the students are asked to explain the significance, most would be able to recall some benefits like being a source of rivers and having a rich biodiversity. However, not all might articulate their thoughts clearly to get full marks. Assuming the question's clarity and prerequisite knowledge, about 60% should score full marks.
