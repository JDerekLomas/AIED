## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Prerequisite Knowledge
The question requires students to understand the basic concepts of heat transfer, specifically identifying and explaining the process of conduction. For Grade 7 students in India, the prerequisite knowledge includes understanding the three main methods of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation. They should also know that conduction is the transfer of heat through a solid material without the movement of the material itself.

## 2: Analyzing the Question for Clarity and Potential Misunderstandings
The question is straightforward and describes a common, relatable scenario. Part (a) asks for the identification of the process of heat transfer, and part (b) requires a brief explanation of how heat travels. A common misunderstanding might be confusing conduction with convection, especially since the scenario involves a fluid (hot tea). However, the question's focus on the spoon's handle becoming hot after being in the tea helps to emphasize conduction.

## 3: Estimating Student Performance
Given that the curriculum for Grade 7 science in India covers basic heat transfer concepts, most students are expected to have a foundational understanding. However, the ability to apply this knowledge accurately in a test setting can vary. For part (a), correctly naming the process as 'Conduction' might be
