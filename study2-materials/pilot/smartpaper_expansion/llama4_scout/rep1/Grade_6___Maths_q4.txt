## Step 1: Understand the concept of LCM and its methods
To find the LCM of 12, 15, and 20, students can use methods such as prime factorization or the common division method. The prime factorization method involves breaking down each number into its prime factors and then taking the highest power of all prime numbers present. The common division method involves dividing the numbers by common factors until they are reduced to 1.

## 2: Determine the prerequisite knowledge needed
Students need to have knowledge of prime numbers, factorization, and the process of finding the LCM using either prime factorization or common division. For prime factorization of 12, 15, and 20, the prime factors are:
- 12 = 2^2 * 3
- 15 = 3 * 5
- 20 = 2^2 * 5
The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number: 2^2, 3, 5. So, LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 60.

## 3: Assess common errors or misunderstandings
Common errors include:
- Not fully factorizing numbers into their prime factors.
- Failing to take the highest power of each
