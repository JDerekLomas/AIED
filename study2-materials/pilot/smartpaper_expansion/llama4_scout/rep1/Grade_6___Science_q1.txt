Reasoning: 
At Grade 6 level in India, students have a basic understanding of magnetism, including the concepts of poles and the behavior of magnets. They learn that like poles (North-North or South-South) repel each other, while unlike poles (North-South or South-North) attract each other. 

Given that this question directly relates to the fundamental concepts typically covered in their curriculum, a significant proportion of students are expected to answer correctly. However, some students might still struggle due to:

1. **Lack of clarity in understanding the concept of poles**: Some students might confuse the behavior of like and unlike poles.
2. **Misinterpretation of the question**: A few might misinterpret "what will you observe" and provide a wrong description of the phenomenon.
3. **Not using scientific terms**: Students might describe the observation in non-scientific terms (e.g., "they will move away") rather than using the term "repel."

Despite these potential pitfalls, given the straightforward nature of the question and the emphasis on practical and observational learning in science education at this level, it is reasonable to assume that about 70% of the students would be able to state that the magnets will repel or push away each other when
