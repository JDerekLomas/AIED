Rationale: 
The question seems clear and is based on a common science experiment related to acids and bases, using natural indicators. For Grade 7 students in India, the concept of acids, bases, and indicators (like litmus, turmeric, and hibiscus extract) is typically covered. 

Pre-requisite knowledge needed includes:
1. Understanding that acids and bases are chemical substances that can be identified using indicators.
2. Knowing that turmeric (or turmeric powder) and hibiscus flower extract can act as indicators.

Specifically, it is essential to recall that:
- Turmeric powder turns red or dark brown in basic solutions and remains yellow in acidic or neutral solutions.

Sources of errors might include:
- Misunderstanding the color changes associated with the indicator (e.g., thinking yellow indicates a base and red indicates an acid).
- Forgetting or not realizing that the liquid should be added to the turmeric powder to observe the color change.
- Suggesting the use of hibiscus extract, which, while scientifically valid as an indicator, might confuse students if they recall its color changes differently (typically, hibiscus turns red/pink in acidic and blue/purple in basic solutions).
- Simply stating that "turmeric will change color"
