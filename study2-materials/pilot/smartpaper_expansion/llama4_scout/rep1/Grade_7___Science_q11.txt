I estimate that about 70% of students would score full marks for this question. The question seems straightforward, and the data provided is clear. For part (a), students primarily need to understand that the liquid with the shortest evaporation time evaporates the fastest. Given that the concept of evaporation and comparing rates based on given data is typically covered in Grade 7 Science in India, most students should be able to identify Liquid A or Petrol as evaporating the fastest.

For part (b), students need to explain why Liquid C (Salt Solution) takes longer to evaporate than Liquid B (Water). The prerequisite knowledge here includes understanding that salt solution has a higher boiling point than water due to the phenomenon of boiling-point elevation, a concept that might not be directly taught but can be inferred through basic understanding of physical changes and properties of solutions. 

However, common errors could arise from misinterpreting the data, not understanding the concept of rate of evaporation, or for part (b), not being able to relate the properties of salt solution to its evaporation rate properly. Some might also struggle to articulate their reasoning clearly for part (b).

Given the clarity of the question and typical curriculum coverage, a significant proportion of students should score well, but some errors due to
