## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks for the age difference between Rahul and his father after 5 years, given that Rahul is 12 years old and his father is thrice his age. The rubric provided focuses on correctly calculating the father's current age: $3 \times 12 = 36$ years, which is worth 1 mark.

## 2: Identify potential errors or misunderstandings
Students might lose marks if they incorrectly calculate the father's current age, do not understand the concept of age difference, or fail to account for the passage of time for both Rahul and his father.

## 3: Assess the clarity of the question
The question seems straightforward and communicates what is expected. It provides Rahul's age and his father's age relative to his, and then asks for the age difference after a specified period.

## 4: Determine the prerequisite knowledge needed
The prerequisite knowledge required includes basic arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition), understanding of the concept of age and time passage, and the ability to follow simple instructions.

## 5: Evaluate the likelihood of students having the prerequisite knowledge
Students in Grade 8 in India are generally expected to have a solid grasp of basic arithmetic operations and simple algebraic concepts. They should be
