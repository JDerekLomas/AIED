I considered that students at this grade level have been introduced to angles and may have some basic understanding of using a protractor. However, the accuracy of drawing angles might vary. Common errors could include incorrect placement of the protractor, misreading the angle, or drawing the angle in the wrong quadrant. Given that this is a practical task requiring manual dexterity and understanding, I estimate that about 20% of the students would accurately draw the 110° angle and get full marks.
