## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric.
The question requires students to analyze data about plant growth under different conditions and answer three parts: (a) identify the most favorable condition for growth, (b) explain why growth is least in darkness, and (c) name the biological process hindered in darkness. For part (a), students must correctly identify 'Full Sunlight' as the most favorable condition based on a data table that is not provided but implied.

## 2: Consider potential errors or misunderstandings.
Students might lose marks if they incorrectly interpret the data, misunderstand what is meant by "most favourable for the plant's growth" (e.g., they might think it refers to a condition that merely allows the plant to survive rather than thrive), or if they incorrectly identify the condition (e.g., choosing 'Darkness' or 'Partial Sunlight' instead of 'Full Sunlight').

## 3: Evaluate the clarity of the question.
The question assumes students understand that plant growth can be influenced by sunlight, which is a basic concept in science. However, without the actual data table, one must assume it's clear that 'Full Sunlight' would lead to the most growth, 'Darkness' the least, and 'Partial
