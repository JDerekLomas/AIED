This estimate is based on the assumption that while many students will have a general understanding of the impact of British colonial rule on tribal communities, providing clear, distinct examples and a coherent explanation may be challenging for some. Specific errors or misunderstandings could include:

1. Failure to clearly articulate the general impact of British rule (e.g., mentioning only the benefits or ignoring the negative aspects).
2. Providing examples that are not distinct or relevant (e.g., repeating the same point or using an example not related to tribal communities).
3. Lack of clarity in explaining how traditional ways of life were disrupted, or in what ways economic exploitation occurred.

The question is fairly clear in its expectations, but prerequisite knowledge about British colonial rule and its effects on tribal communities is necessary. Given the curriculum for Social Science in Grade 8 in India, it's likely that students have been introduced to these topics, but the depth of understanding and ability to provide clear examples may vary. Therefore, I estimate that about 35% of students would be able to provide a clear explanation with distinct examples, scoring full marks.
