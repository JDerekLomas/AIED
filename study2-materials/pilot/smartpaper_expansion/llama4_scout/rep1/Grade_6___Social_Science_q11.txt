I expect about 60% of the students to score full marks as the question is straightforward and requires basic understanding of traffic rules and their importance. Most students at Grade 6 level in India are familiar with traffic rules and their significance due to awareness campaigns and school curriculum. However, some students may struggle to articulate two distinct and plausible reasons or may not fully express how following traffic rules helps the community function smoothly.
