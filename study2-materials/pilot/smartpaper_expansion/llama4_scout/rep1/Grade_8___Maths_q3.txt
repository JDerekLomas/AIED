## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks for the probability of drawing a black ball from a bag containing 4 black balls and 6 white balls. The rubric for full marks requires the student to correctly identify the total number of outcomes (10) and the number of favourable outcomes (4).

## 2: Identify potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include: not counting the total number of balls correctly, miscounting the number of black or white balls, not understanding the concept of probability, or calculating the probability incorrectly even if the total and favourable outcomes are identified.

## 3: Assess the clarity of the question and prerequisite knowledge
The question seems straightforward and communicates clearly what's expected. The prerequisite knowledge needed includes understanding of basic probability concepts and the ability to count. Students at Grade 8 level in India are expected to have a basic understanding of probability.

## 4: Consider the grade level and likely student knowledge
Grade 8 students in India are introduced to probability concepts and are expected to apply them to simple problems. Given that this is a fundamental concept and the question is straightforward, a significant proportion of students are likely to understand what's required.

## 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks
