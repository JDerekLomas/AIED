## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks students to classify given crops as Kharif or Rabi and mention the season they are typically grown in. For part (a), students need to correctly classify Wheat as a Rabi crop. The maximum score for this part is 0.5.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to have prior knowledge about Kharif and Rabi crops, which are typically covered in the context of Indian agricultural practices. Kharif crops are grown during the rainy season (summer monsoon season), while Rabi crops are grown during the winter season.

## 3: Assess common knowledge at Grade 8 level in India
By Grade 8, Indian students are likely to have been introduced to basic agricultural practices, including the classification of crops into Kharif and Rabi. However, the depth of knowledge can vary.

## 4: Consider potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Misclassifying Wheat as a Kharif crop instead of Rabi.
- Not specifying the correct season (though not directly asked, it's implied for understanding).
- Lack of basic knowledge about major crops and their growing seasons.

## 5: Estimate proportion of students scoring full marks
Given that
