Reasoning: 
The question requires students to understand the rock cycle, specifically the transformation of igneous rocks into sedimentary rocks. This involves knowledge of weathering, erosion, and the formation of sediments. While these concepts are part of the Grade 7 Social Science curriculum in India, the extent of understanding can vary. Students might struggle with accurately describing the process or use incorrect terms. Some may not clearly explain how igneous rocks break down and are transported before forming sedimentary rocks, likely leading to partial marks for incomplete explanations. Assuming a fairly standard understanding based on curriculum coverage, around 30% of students might precisely articulate the process to score full marks.
