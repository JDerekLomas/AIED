## Step 1: Understanding the question and requirements
The question requires students to find the distance a car will cover in 12 liters of petrol given that it covers 55 km in 5 liters of petrol. Additionally, students need to calculate the mileage (average) of the car. The rubric provided indicates that to score full marks, students must correctly find the distance for 12 liters of petrol as 132 km.

## 2: Identifying prerequisite knowledge
Students need to understand the concept of proportionality or ratios to solve this problem. They should be able to calculate the distance covered per liter of petrol and then use this rate to find the distance covered in 12 liters.

## 3: Analyzing potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrect calculation of the distance covered per liter of petrol.
- Failure to understand the concept of proportionality.
- Miscalculation when finding the distance for 12 liters of petrol.
- Not calculating the mileage (average) or calculating it incorrectly.

## 4: Assessing the clarity of the question
The question seems clear about what is expected: to find the distance covered in 12 liters of petrol and to determine the car's mileage. However, the rubric focuses only on the distance calculation for full marks.
