## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question is about a pitcher plant, which has a trap-like structure, and it requires students to understand a special mode of nutrition in plants.

## 2: Identifying Key Concepts
The key concepts here include identifying the mode of nutrition as "insectivorous" for the pitcher plant, understanding why a green plant that can perform photosynthesis would still need to trap insects, and providing another example of such a plant.

## 3: Analyzing Part (a) of the Question
For part (a), students need to correctly identify the mode of nutrition. The term "insectivorous" might be less commonly used than "carnivorous" in everyday language, but in the context of science, both terms refer to organisms that derive nutrients from insects. However, specifically, "insectivorous" directly relates to obtaining nutrition from insects.

## 4: Considering Student Knowledge
Grade 7 students in India would have been introduced to basic plant biology, including modes of nutrition in plants. The concept of insectivorous plants is typically covered to highlight unique adaptations.

## 5: Potential Misunderstandings
A common misunderstanding could be identifying the mode of nutrition incorrectly, such as saying "autotrophic"
