## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question requires students to find the cost price (CP) of an item given its marked price (MP) of ₹1200, a 10% discount, and a profit of 8% after the discount. The rubric specifically awards full marks for correctly calculating the Selling Price (SP) after a 10% discount on the MP, which is ₹1080.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
To solve this problem, students need to understand the concepts of discount, selling price, cost price, and profit percentage. They must be able to calculate a percentage of a number (10% of ₹1200) and apply it to find the SP.

## 3: Assess the difficulty of calculating SP after a 10% discount
Calculating the SP after a 10% discount on an MP of ₹1200 involves finding 10% of ₹1200 and subtracting it from ₹1200. This can be expressed as: SP = 1200 - (10% of 1200) = 1200 - 0.10 * 1200 = 1200 * 0.90 = ₹1080. This step seems straightforward.
