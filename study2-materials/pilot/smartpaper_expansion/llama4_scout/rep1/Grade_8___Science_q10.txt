## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Rubric
The question requires students to describe the process of pasteurization and explain why it is used for preserving milk. The rubric provided emphasizes that for full marks, students must correctly describe the process, which involves heating milk to a high temperature for a short time and then cooling it quickly. Specific details like temperature (around 70°C) and time duration (15-30 seconds) are not mandatory.

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors or Misunderstandings
Common errors might include: not mentioning the heating and cooling steps, providing incorrect temperatures or time frames, or not explaining the purpose of pasteurization in preserving milk. Students might also confuse pasteurization with sterilization or other preservation methods.

## 3: Assessing Communication of the Question
The question is straightforward and clearly communicates what's expected. It asks for a description of a process and its purpose, which aligns well with typical science curriculum goals for Grade 8 students.

## 4: Evaluating Prerequisite Knowledge
The prerequisite knowledge needed includes understanding of basic biology (germs and infections), chemistry (effects of heat on bacteria), and possibly some exposure to food preservation methods. Students at this grade level in India are likely to have had some basic science education that
