## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks for the minimum number of pencils required to put an equal number of pencils in each box and how many pencils there would be in each box. The student starts with 112 pencils and 10 empty boxes. The rubric provides a clue on how to approach the problem, mentioning division and remainder.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
The prerequisite knowledge needed includes understanding of division, specifically division with remainders, and the concept of distributing items evenly into groups.

## 3: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Not understanding that to put an equal number of pencils in each box, the total number of pencils must be divisible by the number of boxes.
- Not recognizing the need to round up to the nearest whole number if there is a remainder when dividing the total pencils by the number of boxes.
- Confusing the remainder with the final distribution.

## 4: Consider the clarity of the question
The question seems clear but might benefit from specifying that pencils cannot be split. However, for Grade 6 students, it's reasonable to assume they understand that pencils are indivisible.

## 5: Assess student knowledge at Grade 6 level in India
