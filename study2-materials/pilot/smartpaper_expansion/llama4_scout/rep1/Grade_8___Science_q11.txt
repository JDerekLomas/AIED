## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question requires students to analyze a table showing how different materials expand on heating and answer three parts: (a) identify which material expands the most, (b) explain why gaps are left between railway tracks, and (c) recommend a metal for electrical wires and justify the choice. The rubric provided focuses on part (a) for the maximum score, which is about identifying Aluminium as the material that expands the most.

## 2: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Students might lose marks if they fail to identify Aluminium correctly as the material that expands the most, if they do not understand the concept of expansion upon heating, or if they misinterpret the data provided in the table. For parts (b) and (c), common errors could include not relating expansion to the practical application of leaving gaps in railway tracks or not considering the properties needed for electrical wires (like conductivity, which is implied but not directly listed).

## 3: Assess the clarity of the question and expected response
The question seems to communicate what's expected fairly clearly, as it directly asks for identification and explanation. However, the table itself is not provided in the query, which could affect clarity. Still, assuming the table clearly shows Aluminium
