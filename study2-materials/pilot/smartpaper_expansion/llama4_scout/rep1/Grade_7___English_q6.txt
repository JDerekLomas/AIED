My reasoning is based on several factors:

1. **Specificity of the Question**: The question asks students to describe the poet's writing style, which is quite open-ended. While it does specify that students should identify a suitable and relevant word, the breadth of possible answers can lead to confusion.

2. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Understanding and identifying writing styles require a certain level of literary analysis skill and familiarity with literary terms. Not all Grade 7 students may have been adequately exposed to such analyses in their prior education.

3. **Potential Errors or Misunderstandings**: Students might lose marks for not using the appropriate vocabulary (e.g., using "good" or "bad" instead of literary terms like "simple," "descriptive," etc.), misunderstanding the concept of writing style, or providing overly complex answers that don't align with the rubric.

4. **Grade Level and Curriculum**: The English curriculum for Grade 7 in India aims to introduce students to various literary pieces and basic analytical skills. However, the depth of exposure to literary analysis and the emphasis on identifying writing styles can vary significantly across schools.

Considering these factors, estimating that only a quarter of students would accurately identify a suitable and relevant word describing the poet's writing style without making errors seems conservative
