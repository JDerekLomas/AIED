My reasoning: 

- The task requires students to express their personal preference for a season and elaborate on it, which might be challenging for some students, especially those whose writing skills are still developing.
- Students need to ensure they cover what they like to do, eat, wear, and explain why they like the season, all within 6-8 lines, which could lead to incomplete answers or irrelevant details.
- Additionally, naming the favorite season explicitly as per the rubric could be overlooked by some students.
- Given the class level (Grade 6) and common curriculum standards in India, while most students have a basic understanding of writing and can identify their favorite seasons, articulating their thoughts coherently and fully as per the question's requirements might be difficult for a significant number of them.

Hence, I estimate that approximately 30% would manage to write a complete and relevant paragraph that covers their favorite season along with the required details, thereby scoring full marks.
