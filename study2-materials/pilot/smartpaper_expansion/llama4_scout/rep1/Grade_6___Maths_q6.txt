## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks students to compare the areas of a given rectangle and a square, and then find the difference in their areas. The rubric specifies that to get full marks, a student must calculate the area of the rectangle as $5 \times 4 = 20$ sq.cm and the area of the square as $5 \times 5 = 25$ sq.cm.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
The prerequisite knowledge needed for this question is the formula for the area of a rectangle (length $\times$ width) and the area of a square (side $\times$ side). Students should also be able to compare two values and find the difference between them.

## 3: Consider common errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Misapplying the formulas for the areas (e.g., using length $\times$ length for the rectangle or length $\times$ width for the square).
- Incorrectly calculating the products (e.g., $5 \times 4 = 22$ instead of $20$).
- Forgetting to find the difference in areas or doing the subtraction incorrectly.
- Misinterpreting the question and providing incorrect comparisons.

## 4: Assess the clarity
