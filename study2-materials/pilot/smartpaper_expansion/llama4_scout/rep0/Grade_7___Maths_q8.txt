## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks students to find the distance a car will cover in 12 liters of petrol given that it covers 55 km in 5 liters of petrol. Additionally, it asks for the mileage (average) the car gives. The rubric for full marks requires students to correctly find the distance for 12 liters of petrol as 132 km.

## 2: Identify the prerequisite knowledge needed
Students need to understand the concept of proportionality or ratios to solve this problem. They should be able to calculate the distance covered per liter of petrol and then use this rate to find the distance covered in 12 liters.

## 3: Calculate the expected solution
First, find the distance covered per liter: 55 km / 5 liters = 11 km/liter. Then, use this rate to find the distance covered in 12 liters: 11 km/liter * 12 liters = 132 km.

## 4: Consider potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrectly calculating the distance per liter.
- Not using the correct operation (e.g., adding or subtracting instead of multiplying).
- Misinterpreting the concept of mileage.
- Calculation errors.

## 5: Assess the clarity
