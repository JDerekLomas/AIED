The estimate for the proportion of students who would score full marks for rearranging the words to make a meaningful sentence is: 0.7 

This estimate considers that most students at Grade 6 level in India have a good grasp of basic sentence structures in English, specifically the subject-verb-object (SVO) format. The words given are also straightforward and commonly used, making it relatively easy for students to rearrange them into a coherent sentence. However, a few might struggle due to not understanding the correct order or making small errors in word order.
