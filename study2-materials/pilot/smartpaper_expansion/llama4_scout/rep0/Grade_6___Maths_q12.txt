## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks for the minimum number of pencils required to put an equal number of pencils in each box and how many pencils would be in each box. The rubric provides a clue on how to approach it: finding how many pencils would go into each box with the current total, which involves division and understanding remainders.

## 2: Identify the prerequisite knowledge needed
Students need to have a basic understanding of division, specifically division with remainders, to solve this problem. They also need to understand that to put an equal number of pencils in each box, the total number of pencils must be divisible by the number of boxes.

## 3: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Not understanding the concept of remainders in division.
- Not realizing that to have an equal number of pencils in each box, the total number of pencils must be divisible by the number of boxes.
- Misinterpreting the question and not calculating the minimum number of pencils required.

## 4: Assess the clarity of the question and student knowledge at Grade 6 level
The question seems clear, but the solution requires applying division skills and understanding the practical implication of remainders. Grade 6 students in India
