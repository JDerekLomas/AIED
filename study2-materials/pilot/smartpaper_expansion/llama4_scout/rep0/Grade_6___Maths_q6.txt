## Step 1: Understand the Question and Requirements
The question asks students to compare the areas of a given rectangle (length = 5 cm, width = 4 cm) and a square (side = 5 cm), and then determine by how much one area is greater than the other.

## 2: Identify Prerequisite Knowledge
To answer this question, students need to know the formulas for the area of a rectangle (length * width) and a square (side * side or side^2).

## 3: Assess the Complexity of the Task
The task involves simple multiplication and subtraction, which is within the skill level of Grade 6 students. The area of the rectangle is 5 * 4 = 20 sq.cm, and the area of the square is 5 * 5 = 25 sq.cm. Students then need to find the difference: 25 - 20 = 5 sq.cm.

## 4: Consider Potential Errors
Common errors might include:
- Incorrectly calculating the area of either the rectangle or the square.
- Forgetting to find the difference in areas.
- Misinterpreting which shape has a greater area.

## 5: Evaluate Student Understanding at Grade 6 Level
By Grade 6, most students
