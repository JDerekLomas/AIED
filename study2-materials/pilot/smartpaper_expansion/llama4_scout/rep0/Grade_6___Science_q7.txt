My reasoning: 

Students in Grade 6 in India have a basic understanding of nutrition and the importance of different food groups. They learn about the food pyramid and the role of various nutrients in maintaining good health. The question clearly mentions that Kartik has eaten a lot of fruits and vegetables but no milk. To answer this question correctly, students need to recall that milk is a rich source of calcium, which is essential for building strong bones and teeth, particularly in growing children.

Most students at this level would be able to identify milk or dairy products as the missing component in Kartik's diet. A specific error that might cause students to lose marks is if they confuse the nutritional benefits of different food groups or do not associate milk with providing essential nutrients like calcium.

Given the clarity of the question and the prerequisite knowledge that students are likely to possess at this grade level, I estimate that about 70% of students would score full marks. This proportion assumes that a significant number of students have been taught about basic nutrition and can apply that knowledge to identify the missing component in Kartik's diet. However, a small proportion might struggle due to lack of understanding or recall of the importance of dairy products in a balanced diet.
