The reason behind this estimate is that the students at Grade 6 level in India are generally familiar with the basic rules of using 'some' and 'any'. 'Some' is typically used in positive sentences, while 'any' is used in negative sentences or questions. Given that the sentence provided is a positive statement, most students would be expected to choose 'some' as the correct word. However, a few might still get it wrong due to lack of practice or misunderstanding of the rules. Hence, I estimate that about 70% of the students would score full marks.
