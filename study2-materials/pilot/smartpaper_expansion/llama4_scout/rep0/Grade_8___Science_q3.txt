Rationale: 
The concept of malleability is typically covered in Grade 8 Science curriculum in India, under the topic of properties of metals. Given that it's a fundamental concept and students at this level are likely to have been introduced to it, a significant proportion of students should be able to answer correctly. However, some students may not recall it accurately or might be confused with other properties like ductility. Hence, I estimate that about 70% of students would score full marks.
