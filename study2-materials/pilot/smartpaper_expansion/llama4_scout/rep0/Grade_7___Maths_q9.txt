## Step 1: Understanding the question and the expected operation
The question requires students to find out how far a bus can travel on $5 \frac{3}{4}$ litres of diesel, given that it travels 10 km on 1 litre of diesel. The correct operation to solve this problem is multiplication, as the distance travelled is directly proportional to the amount of diesel.

## 2: Identifying prerequisite knowledge
Students need to have a basic understanding of multiplication and division of fractions or mixed numbers, as well as the concept of proportionality. They should also be comfortable converting mixed numbers to improper fractions or working with them directly.

## 3: Estimating common errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include: 
- Adding instead of multiplying (incorrectly applying the operation),
- Not understanding how to work with mixed numbers ($5 \frac{3}{4}$),
- Incorrectly calculating the product of $10$ km/litre and $5 \frac{3}{4}$ litres.

## 4: Assessing the clarity of the question and likelihood of prerequisite knowledge
The question seems straightforward and clearly communicates what's expected. For Grade 7 students in India, it is likely that they have been exposed to and have a good grasp of the necessary concepts, including working
