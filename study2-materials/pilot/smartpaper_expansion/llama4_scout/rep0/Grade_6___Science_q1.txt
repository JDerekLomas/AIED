Reasoning: 
In India, by Grade 6, most students are familiar with the basic properties of magnets, including the concept of poles and the behavior of magnets when like poles are brought together. The question clearly communicates what's expected, and the concept of repulsion between like poles (North-North or South-South) is straightforward. Students who have prior knowledge of magnets would likely recall that like poles repel each other.

However, some students might still be developing their understanding or might misinterpret the question. Common errors could include thinking that the magnets will attract each other (which happens with unlike poles), or not understanding the terminology (e.g., "North pole"). Despite this, given the simplicity of the concept and its coverage in the curriculum, a significant proportion of students are expected to answer correctly.

Pre-requisite knowledge required includes understanding that magnets have poles and knowing the basic interaction between magnets. Given that this is typically introduced in earlier grades, most students at this level should be familiar with these concepts. 

Hence, estimating that about 70% of students would score full marks seems reasonable.
