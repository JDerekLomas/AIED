## Step 1: Understand the question and rubric
The question requires students to analyze a table showing how different materials expand on heating and answer three parts: (a) identify the material that expands the most, (b) explain why gaps are left between railway tracks, and (c) recommend a metal for electrical wires and justify. The rubric provided focuses on part (a) for maximum score.

## 2: Identify potential errors or misunderstandings
Potential errors include: misidentification of the material that expands the most, lack of understanding of thermal expansion concepts, and incorrect application of concepts to real-world scenarios like railway tracks and electrical wires.

## 3: Assess communication clarity and prerequisite knowledge
The question assumes students have basic knowledge of thermal expansion. The clarity of the question seems adequate for students who understand the concept of thermal expansion.

## 4: Evaluate student knowledge at the grade level
Grade 8 students in India are typically introduced to the concept of thermal expansion. However, their ability to apply this concept to various materials and real-world scenarios can vary.

## 5: Estimate proportion of students scoring full marks
Given that the question is straightforward and focuses on basic concepts of thermal expansion that are typically covered in Grade 8, a significant proportion of students
