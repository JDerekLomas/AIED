## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks students to find the value of `8 ÷ 7.2` and the rubric suggests that students can set up the division by converting it to `80 ÷ 72` to remove the decimal to score full marks. The maximum score for this question is 0.5.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to be familiar with division operations, converting decimals to a form that is easier to divide (in this case, multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 10 to shift the decimal point), and basic calculation skills.

## 3: Consider common errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include not converting the decimal to an equivalent fraction or whole number division (e.g., directly dividing 8 by 7.2 without conversion), incorrect conversion (e.g., converting 7.2 to 72 but not adjusting 8 accordingly), or miscalculation during the division process.

## 4: Assess the clarity of the question and expected knowledge at Grade 7 level
The question seems straightforward, but the method to achieve the solution (converting to `80 ÷ 72`) might not immediately occur to all students. At the Grade 7 level in India, students are
