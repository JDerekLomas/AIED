## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks about the mode of nutrition of a pitcher plant, why it traps insects despite being able to perform photosynthesis, and to give another example of such a plant. The specific part we're focusing on for estimating the proportion of students who would score full marks on part (a) is identifying the mode of nutrition as "insectivorous."

## 2: Identify potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Confusing the mode of nutrition with another term (e.g., parasitic, saprophytic).
- Not understanding that the term "insectivorous" specifically refers to obtaining nutrients by capturing and consuming insects.
- Thinking that because the plant is green and can perform photosynthesis, it doesn't have a special mode of nutrition related to capturing insects.

## 3: Assess the clarity of the question and expected response
The question clearly communicates what's expected for part (a), which is to identify the special mode of nutrition. The term "insectivorous" is specific and directly related to plants that obtain nutrients by trapping insects.

## 4: Determine the prerequisite knowledge needed
Prerequisite knowledge includes:
- Understanding that plants generally make their own food through photosynthesis.
- Knowing that some plants
