0.7 

I'm assuming that most students at this grade level have some basic knowledge of agriculture and plants, and the question is clear and straightforward. However, to score full marks, students need to provide a correct definition of weeds and explain why weeding is important. I anticipate that around 30% might struggle with either defining weeds accurately or explaining the significance of weeding, or both, due to lack of clarity or prerequisite knowledge. Hence, my estimate is 0.7.
