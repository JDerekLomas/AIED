The question requires students to provide two key characteristics for both living and non-living things. The rubric provided focuses on a valid characteristic of living things, giving a partial score of 0.5 for one correct characteristic.

Common errors or misunderstandings might include:

1. **Lack of clear characteristics:** Students might provide vague or incomplete explanations (e.g., "living things are alive," or "non-living things are not alive").
2. **Incorrect examples rather than characteristics:** Some students might list examples of living or non-living things instead of describing their characteristics.
3. **Partial understanding:** Students might correctly identify one characteristic but struggle to provide a second valid one.

Given these considerations, I estimate that approximately 20% of the students would manage to articulate two clear, valid characteristics for both living and
