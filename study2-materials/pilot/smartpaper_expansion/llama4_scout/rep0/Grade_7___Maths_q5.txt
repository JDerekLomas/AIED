## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question requires students to calculate how many ₹5 coins can be made from a given set of coins: 10 coins of 10 paise, 5 coins of 20 paise, and 16 coins of 50 paise. The rubric provides the correct steps to find the total value of the given coins and implies that if a student correctly finds the total value to be ₹10.00, they can then determine that 2 ₹5 coins can be made.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge needed
Students need to understand the value of different denominations of coins in rupees and paise, and be able to convert paise to rupees (100 paise = ₹1). They also need to know how to perform basic multiplication and addition.

## 3: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrect conversion from paise to rupees.
- Miscalculation of the total value of each type of coin.
- Failure to add the values of all types of coins together.
- Not understanding how to find the number of ₹5 coins that can be made from the total amount.

## 4: Consider the clarity of the question and student knowledge at Grade 7 level
