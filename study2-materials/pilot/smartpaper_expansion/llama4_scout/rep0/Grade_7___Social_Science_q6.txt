Rationale: 

The question is relatively straightforward and requires students to have basic knowledge about the significance of the Himalayas to the Indian subcontinent. Most Grade 7 students in India are expected to have this foundational knowledge, given that it is part of their NCERT Social Science textbooks. Two plausible points, for instance, could be:

1. The Himalayas act as a water source for many rivers that flow through the Indian subcontinent, supporting agriculture and the lifestyle of millions of people.
2. The Himalayas serve as a natural barrier protecting the subcontinent from cold winds coming from the north and also act as a defense barrier against potential invasions.

Given that the instructions specify to state "any two points," students need to articulate their points well, not just list but somewhat elaborate or clearly state why these are significant. Assuming students have been taught this and it aligns with their curriculum, errors might come from not distinctly stating two points or providing incomplete/inaccurate information. However, because it's an open-ended question allowing for simple statements and because the main requirement is identification of points rather than their elaboration, I estimate that a significant proportion would score full marks with adequate teaching and common curriculum alignment.

Common errors could include not completing two distinct points, misinterpreting
