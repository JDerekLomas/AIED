My reasoning is based on the fact that the question is fairly straightforward and the concepts of archaeological and literary sources are typically introduced in Grade 6 Social Science classes in India. Most students would likely be familiar with the basic idea that archaeological sources are physical remains, and they might be able to recall examples like pottery, coins, or monuments. However, the extent to which they can clearly articulate the definition and provide a correct example might vary. Assuming that the teaching has been effective, I estimate that about 70% of students would score full marks.
