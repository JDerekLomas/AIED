I estimate that about 30% of Grade 7 students in India would score full marks for this question. 

The question requires students to understand the basic differences between the digestive system of ruminants (like cows) and humans, which is a part of the science curriculum in India. Students need to recall that ruminants have a unique digestive system with multiple stomachs or sections, specifically the rumen, which allows them to digest plant-based foods like grasses and cellulose.

However, some students may not have a clear understanding of the ruminant digestive system or might get confused with human digestion. Possible errors or misunderstandings could include:
- Not mentioning the presence of multiple stomachs or sections
- Confusing ruminants with monogastric animals (like humans)
- Failing to relate the digestive system difference to their diet

Given the prior knowledge required and potential areas of confusion, I believe 30% of students would be able to clearly articulate the key difference between the digestive systems of ruminants and humans.
