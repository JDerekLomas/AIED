## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Distributive Property
The question requires students to apply the distributive property to simplify the given expression: `{9/16 xx 4/12} + {9/16 xx (-3/9)}`. The distributive property in this context means factoring out the common factor `9/16` to simplify the expression into `9/16 * (4/12 + (-3/9))`. This step involves understanding that the distributive property allows us to perform operations more efficiently.

## 2: Identifying Prerequisite Knowledge
Prerequisite knowledge for solving this problem includes understanding fractions, how to add and multiply fractions, and applying the distributive property. Students should be familiar with finding a common denominator for adding fractions and simplifying expressions.

## 3: Potential Errors and Misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Not recognizing the common factor `9/16` that can be factored out.
- Difficulty in adding fractions with different denominators within the parentheses.
- Incorrectly applying the distributive property or not applying it at all.
- Errors in multiplying or adding fractions.

## 4: Assessing Student Understanding and Skill Level
Grade 8 students in India are expected to have a solid grasp of fractions, including operations with fractions. However, the
