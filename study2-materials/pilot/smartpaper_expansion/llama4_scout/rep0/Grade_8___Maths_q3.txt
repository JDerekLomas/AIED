My reasoning: 

The question seems straightforward and directly assessable. The prerequisite knowledge required for solving this problem is basic understanding of probability, which is a part of the Grade 8 Mathematics curriculum in India. Students at this level are expected to know how to calculate probability using the formula: probability = number of favourable outcomes / total number of outcomes.

Given the simplicity of the question and its alignment with the curriculum, I estimate that about 70% of students would score full marks, assuming they understand and can apply the basic probability concept correctly. Common errors might include not counting the total number of balls correctly (4 black + 6 white = 10 balls) or misunderstanding what constitutes a favourable outcome (drawing a black ball). However, since the question is quite direct and the calculations simple, I expect a relatively high proportion of students to get it right.
