 reasoning: 
In Grade 6, students in India are expected to have basic knowledge of factors and multiples. However, the question requires students to find all the factors of 68, which may pose some challenge. 

Students might make mistakes in finding factors, such as:
- Forgetting 1 and the number itself (68) as factors
- Finding only prime factors (2 and 17) and not all factors
- Making calculation errors while finding factors (e.g., 68 ÷ 3 or other incorrect divisions)

Assuming a typical class, I'd estimate around 25% of students would be able to list all the correct factors: 1, 2, 4, 17, 34, and 68.
