## Step 1: Understand the question and requirements
The question asks for the sum of the smallest and largest 5-digit palindrome numbers and also their difference. A 5-digit palindrome must read the same forwards and backwards.

## 2: Identify smallest and largest 5-digit palindromes
The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10,001 and the largest is 99,999.

## 3: Calculate the sum and difference
The sum = 10,001 + 99,999 = 110,000. The difference = 99,999 - 10,001 = 89,998. The question, however, only explicitly asks for the sum for full marks.

## 4: Consider potential errors or misunderstandings
- Students may not understand what a palindrome is.
- They might incorrectly identify the smallest or largest 5-digit palindromes.
- Calculation errors in summing or finding the difference.

## 5: Evaluate prerequisite knowledge
Students need to understand the concept of palindromes, how to identify the smallest and largest 5-digit numbers that are palindromes, and basic addition and subtraction.

## 6: Assess likely student performance at Grade 6 level in India
Typically, Grade 6 students in India would
