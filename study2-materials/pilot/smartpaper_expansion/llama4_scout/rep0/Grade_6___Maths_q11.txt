## Step 1: Understand the problem and the rubric
The problem requires finding the maximum weight that can measure the weights of two bags of fertiliser (75 kg and 69 kg) an exact number of times. This translates to finding the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of 75 and 69. The maximum score for the question is 0.5.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
To solve this problem, students need to understand what the Highest Common Factor (HCF) or Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) means and how to calculate it. They should be familiar with the methods of finding HCF, such as listing factors, prime factorization, or using the Euclidean algorithm.

## 3: Assess the clarity of the question
The question seems clear in its requirement: to find a weight that can measure both 75 kg and 69 kg an exact number of times. However, it does not explicitly mention that this is a HCF problem, which might lead some students to try other approaches or not recognize the problem type immediately.

## 4: Consider common misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Not recognizing the problem as requiring HCF.
- Incorrectly calculating HCF (e.g., finding the LCM instead, or using an incorrect method
