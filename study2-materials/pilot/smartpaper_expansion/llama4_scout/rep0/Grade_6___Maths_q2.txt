I've considered that students in Grade 6 in India have a basic understanding of place values. The question seems straightforward, and most students should be able to identify that the place value of 5 in 7560 is 500 or hundreds. However, some students might still struggle with this concept or make careless mistakes, which is why I wouldn't estimate a perfect score for all students.
