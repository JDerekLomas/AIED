## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to find the angle measures `x` and `y` in given figures, with a focus on correctly finding `x = 80°` and providing the reason and calculation for it.

## 2: Identifying Prerequisite Knowledge
Students need to have knowledge of basic geometry, specifically properties of angles in different types of figures (like triangles, quadrilaterals, and polygons), and possibly theorems related to angle sums.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors
Common errors might include not using the properties of angles correctly (e.g., not knowing that angles in a triangle add up to 180°, or that a straight line's angles add up to 180°), incorrect calculations, or failure to provide reasons for the answers.

## 4: Communicating Expectations
The question seems to imply that figures are provided, but without seeing the figures, students must infer or recall common geometric properties. The expectation is clear for `x`, but the lack of visual information could cause confusion.

## 5: Assessing Student Knowledge at Grade 8 in India
By Grade 8 in India, students are typically familiar with basic geometric concepts, including types of angles and simple geometric figures. They are expected to apply these concepts to solve
