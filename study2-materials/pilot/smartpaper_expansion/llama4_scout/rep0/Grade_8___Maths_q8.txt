My reasoning is based on the assumption that most students at this grade level are familiar with the basic properties of a parallelogram, specifically that opposite angles are equal and adjacent angles are supplementary. However, to score full marks, students not only need to calculate the angle correctly but also provide a valid explanation for their answer. Given that this is a relatively straightforward question and assuming the diagram is clearly provided, I estimate that about 70% of students would be able to find angle `x` as 110 degrees and provide a satisfactory explanation. Common errors that might reduce this proportion include miscalculating the angle, failing to provide an explanation, or misunderstanding the properties of a parallelogram.
