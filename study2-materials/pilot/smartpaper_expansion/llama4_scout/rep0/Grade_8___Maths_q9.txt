## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question requires students to find the cost price (CP) of an item given that its marked price (MP) is ₹1200, a 10% discount is applied, and the shopkeeper makes an 8% profit even after the discount. The rubric specifically awards 1 mark for correctly calculating the Selling Price (SP) after the 10% discount on the MP.

## 2: Calculate the Selling Price (SP) after discount
To calculate SP: MP = ₹1200, Discount = 10% of ₹1200 = 0.10 * ₹1200 = ₹120. So, SP = MP - Discount = ₹1200 - ₹120 = ₹1080.

## 3: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to understand percentages, calculating discounts, and the relationship between cost price, selling price, and profit percentage. The formula for selling price based on cost price and profit percentage is SP = CP * (1 + profit%/100).

## 4: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
- Miscalculation of the discount amount or the selling price after discount.
- Confusion between the formulas for calculating profit, loss, discount, and the relationships between CP, SP
