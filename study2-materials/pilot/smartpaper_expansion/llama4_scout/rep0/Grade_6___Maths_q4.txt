## Step 1: Understand the concept of LCM and its methods
To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12, 15, and 20, students can use methods such as prime factorization or the common division method. The prime factorization method involves breaking down each number into its prime factors and then taking the highest power of all prime numbers from these factorizations. The common division method involves dividing the numbers by common factors until they are reduced to 1.

## 2: Determine the prerequisite knowledge needed
Students need to have knowledge of prime numbers, factorization, and the concept of LCM. They should be able to find prime factors of a number and understand how to apply these to find the LCM of multiple numbers.

## 3: Assess the clarity of the question and expected response
The question clearly asks for the LCM of 12, 15, and 20 without specifying the method, which allows students to choose their preferred approach. The rubric indicates that demonstrating a correct method (e.g., prime factorization or common division) is what matters, not just the correct answer.

## 4: Consider common errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include incorrect prime factorization, not using the highest power of prime factors, confusion between LCM and Greatest Common
