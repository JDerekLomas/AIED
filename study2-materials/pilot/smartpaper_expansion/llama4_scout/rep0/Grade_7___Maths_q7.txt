## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Requirements
The question requires students to compare two values: `1/2` of `3/4` and `2/5` of `2/3`, and show their calculations. To get full marks, students must correctly calculate both values as `3/8` and `4/15`, respectively.

## 2: Identifying Prerequisite Knowledge
Students need to have a good understanding of fraction multiplication. The prerequisite knowledge includes knowing how to multiply fractions (i.e., `a/b` of `c/d` is `(a/b) * (c/d) = (ac)/(bd)`) and how to simplify fractions if necessary.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors or Misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrect multiplication of fractions.
- Failure to simplify or compare the resulting fractions correctly.
- Mistakes in calculating `1/2 * 3/4` or `2/5 * 2/3`.
- Difficulty in comparing fractions (e.g., not finding a common denominator).

## 4: Assessing Student Preparedness
By Grade 7 in India, students are expected to have a solid foundation in basic arithmetic operations, including fraction multiplication and comparison. However, the ability to
