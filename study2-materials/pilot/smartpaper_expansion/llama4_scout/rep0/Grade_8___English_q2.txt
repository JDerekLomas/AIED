Reasoning: Given that this question seems to relate to a typical scene description that might be part of a literature or comprehension exercise commonly found in Grade 8 English curricula in India, students are generally expected to have a basic level of proficiency in descriptive comprehension. The sounds of birds returning to their nests at sunset is a clichéd imagery often used to describe the setting sun or evening scenes, suggesting it should be readily accessible to most students. 

However, not all students might precisely recall this exact imagery or might phrase their answers in a way that does not specifically match "hearing the sound of birds returning to their nests" but still implies a similar idea (e.g., birds chirping as the sun sets). The clarity of the question and its alignment with common descriptive themes at this educational level suggest a relatively high proportion of students would score full marks, assuming standard teaching practices and textual exposure.

Possible errors or misunderstandings could include not describing any sounds (silence), inaccurately describing the scene (e.g., associating the wrong sounds with sunset), or choosing to describe visuals rather than sounds, suggesting a slight adjustment from perfect to a more realistic estimate.
