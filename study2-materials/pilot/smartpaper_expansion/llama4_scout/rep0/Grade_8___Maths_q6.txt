## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks for the age difference between Rahul and his father after 5 years, given that Rahul is 12 years old and his father is thrice his age. The rubric provided focuses on correctly calculating the father's current age as 3 × 12 = 36 years for a maximum score of 1.

## 2: Identify specific errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrectly calculating the father's current age.
- Not adding 5 years to both Rahul's and his father's age to find their ages after 5 years.
- Calculating the age difference incorrectly after finding their ages after 5 years.

## 3: Assess the clarity of the question
The question seems clear in what is being asked, but students might get confused if they don't read it carefully, especially regarding what is required for the full marks (calculating father's current age).

## 4: Determine prerequisite knowledge needed
The prerequisite knowledge needed includes:
- Basic multiplication (to calculate the father's age).
- Understanding of how to calculate age differences.
- Ability to add 5 years to find future ages.

## 5: Evaluate students' likelihood of having the prerequisite knowledge
