I estimate that only 20% of students would score full marks. This is because while many students may have a basic understanding of decomposition and its benefits for soil health, a significant number may struggle to articulate clear reasons for the changes observed or may not fully connect the process to its benefits for soil health. Some may also lack the understanding of microorganisms' role in decomposition. Additionally, effective communication of their thoughts in line with the expected reasons and benefits might be a challenge for many.
