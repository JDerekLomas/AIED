Considering the question requires students to name one major landform in Rajasthan and briefly describe it, with the accepted answers being "The Thar Desert (or Marusthali)" or "the Aravalli Range," let's analyze the factors:

1. **Specific Errors or Misunderstandings**: Students might lose marks if they:
   - Name a landform not recognized as major in Rajasthan.
   - Fail to mention either The Thar Desert or the Aravalli Range.
   - Provide a description that is inaccurate or too vague.

2. **Clarity of the Question**: The question is straightforward and specifies the need for a name and a brief description, which should help students understand what's expected.

3. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Students need to have a basic understanding of Indian geography, specifically landforms in Rajasthan. 

4. **Likelihood of Having the Knowledge**: Given that Social Science in Grade 6 includes basic geography, most students should be familiar with major Indian landforms and specifically those in Rajasthan. The Thar Desert and the Aravalli Range are significant and commonly taught.

Assuming typical classroom teaching covers major Indian geographical features, and considering Rajasthan's notable landforms, I estimate around 70% of students would score full marks. The optimism is based on
