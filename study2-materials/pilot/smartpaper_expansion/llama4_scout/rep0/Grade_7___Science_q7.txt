## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question requires students to address a crop issue (stunted growth and yellowing of leaves) caused by a nutrient deficiency in the soil. The expected response is to recommend adding fertilizers or manures rich in the lacking nutrient and to mention a correct essential nutrient like nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to know that:
- Crops require essential nutrients for healthy growth.
- Common essential nutrients for plant growth are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
- Yellowing of leaves and stunted growth can be symptoms of a nutrient deficiency.

## 3: Assess student knowledge at Grade 7 level in India
By Grade 7 in India, students have a basic understanding of biology, including the needs of plants for growth. They should be familiar with the concept that plants need nutrients from the soil, which can be supplemented with fertilizers or manures.

## 4: Predict common errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Not specifying a nutrient.
- Suggesting irrelevant solutions (e.g., pesticides, changing irrigation methods).
- Not connecting the symptoms to a nutrient deficiency.

## 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks
Given the
