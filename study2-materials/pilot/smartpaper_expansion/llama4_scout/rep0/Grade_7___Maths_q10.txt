## Step 1: Understand the question and rubric
The question asks students to find the width and area of a rectangle given its perimeter and length. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by \(P = 2 \times (length + width)\). Here, \(P = 32\) cm and \(length = 10\) cm. The rubric specifies that students need to solve for width by setting up the equation \(2 \times (10 + w) = 32\), find \(w = 6\) cm, and implicitly use this to find the area, though the area calculation is not directly mentioned in the rubric.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to know the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, \(P = 2 \times (length + width)\), and be able to solve a simple linear equation. They also need to understand how to calculate the area of a rectangle, \(Area = length \times width\), though the area calculation is not explicitly required in the rubric.

## 3: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Not setting up the correct equation for the perimeter.
- Solving the equation incorrectly (e.g., not dividing both sides by 2 properly).
- Forgetting to find the area
