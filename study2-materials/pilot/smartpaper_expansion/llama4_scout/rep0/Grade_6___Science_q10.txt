## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Rubric
The question requires students to analyze a table (though the table itself isn't provided) that presumably shows the growth of a plant under three different conditions: full sunlight, partial sunlight, and darkness, over a period of 10 days. The questions ask students to identify the most favorable condition for growth, explain why growth is least in darkness, and name the biological process hindered in darkness.

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors or Misunderstandings
For part (a), students might lose marks if they incorrectly interpret the data or misunderstand what "most favourable for the plant's growth" means. For part (b), errors could arise from a lack of understanding of how light affects plant growth or failure to provide a clear explanation. For part (c), students need to know basic plant biology, specifically photosynthesis, and recognize it as the process hindered in darkness.

## 3: Clarity of the Question and Expected Response
The question seems to communicate what's expected fairly clearly, given that the table provides specific data on plant growth under different conditions. However, without seeing the actual data, one assumes it supports the general biological principle that plants grow best in sunlight and least in darkness.
