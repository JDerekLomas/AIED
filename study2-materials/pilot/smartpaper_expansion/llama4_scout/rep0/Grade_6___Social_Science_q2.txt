Given the context and requirements of the question, here's my thought process:

1. **Understanding the Question**: The question clearly asks for two famous kings from the medieval period of Rajasthan. This specificity helps students focus on a particular historical period and geographical region.

2. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Students need to have a basic understanding of Indian history, specifically the medieval period, and some notable figures from Rajasthan during that time. 

3. **Likely Errors or Misunderstandings**: 
   - Students might name kings from other periods (like ancient or modern India).
   - They might refer to rulers from other regions of India, not Rajasthan.
   - There could be confusion between historical figures and mythological or legendary characters.

4. **Student Knowledge at Grade 6 Level**: 
   - By Grade 6, students in India typically have a foundational understanding of Indian history, which includes major dynasties and influential rulers.

5. **Specificity of Request**: The question asks for two names. Since the rubric gives 0.5 marks for one correct king, getting full marks requires identifying two correct kings.

Considering these factors, most students are expected to have some knowledge of Maharana Pratap, given his prominent stature in Indian history, especially concerning Rajasthan. However
