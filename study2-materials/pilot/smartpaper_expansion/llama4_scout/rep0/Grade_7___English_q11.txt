My reasoning: 

The question requires students to identify the adjective phrase in a given sentence. The sentence provided is simple, and the adjective "tiny" clearly modifies the noun "bird". At Grade 7 level, most students are expected to have a basic understanding of adjectives and their functions in sentences.

However, some students might not score full marks due to:

1. Not understanding the concept of adjectives and adjective phrases.
2. Confusing the adjective with the noun or other parts of speech.
3. Not being able to identify "tiny" as an adjective.

Assuming a fairly standard curriculum and teaching in Indian schools, I estimate around 70% of students would be able to identify "tiny" as an adjective, given that they have been exposed to basic grammar concepts up to this level. However, without more information on specific teaching methods and student performance data, this remains an estimate.
