To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks for this question, let's consider several factors:

1. **Understanding of the Question**: The question clearly communicates what's expected from the students. They are required to compare the growth and development of two plants, one grown in soil with organic manure (gobar khaad) and the other in soil with a high nitrogen chemical fertilizer (urea), and explain the differences.

2. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Students need to understand basic concepts of plant nutrition, the role of manure and chemical fertilizers in plant growth, and possibly the differences between organic and inorganic (chemical) fertilizers. This includes knowing that nitrogen promotes leafy growth.

3. **Expected Differences and Reasoning**: The question expects students to predict that the plant in Pot 'B' (with chemical fertilizer) will show faster and taller initial growth compared to the plant in Pot 'A' (with manure). This is based on the rapid availability of nitrogen in chemical fertilizers, which promotes quick growth. Students are also supposed to provide a reason, which likely involves understanding that chemical fertilizers provide readily available nutrients (especially nitrogen in this case) to plants, leading to rapid growth.

4. **Potential Errors or Misunderstandings**:
    - Some students might not clearly understand the role of
