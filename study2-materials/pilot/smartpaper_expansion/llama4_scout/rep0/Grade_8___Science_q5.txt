## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to classify two crops, Wheat and Paddy (Rice), as either Kharif or Rabi and mention the season in which they are typically grown. The rubric provided specifically mentions that for Wheat to receive full marks, it must be correctly classified as a Rabi crop.

## 2: Identifying Prerequisite Knowledge
