Here's my reasoning:

1. **Clarity of the Question**: The question is straightforward and asks for key features of the Indian Constitution. It does not specify how many features are expected, which is covered by the rubric that mentions any one correct feature.

2. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: By Grade 8, students in India are expected to have a basic understanding of the Indian Constitution as part of their Social Science curriculum. This includes fundamental concepts such as it being the longest written constitution, the emphasis on fundamental rights, the principles of federalism, parliamentary democracy, secularism, and an independent judiciary.
