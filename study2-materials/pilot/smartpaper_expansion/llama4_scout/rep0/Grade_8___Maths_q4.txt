## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Requirements
The question requires solving a linear equation to find the value of \(x\): \((x-5)/3 = (x-3)/5\). The first step in solving this equation involves cross-multiplication.

## 2: Identifying Prerequisite Knowledge
To solve this problem, students need to have a basic understanding of algebra, specifically the process of cross-multiplication in equations and how to expand and solve linear equations.

## 3: Cross-Multiplication Step
The correct cross-multiplication step is \(5(x-5) = 3(x-3)\), which leads to \(5x - 25 = 3x - 9\). This step is crucial and is where students might lose marks if they fail to cross-multiply correctly or make algebraic mistakes.

## 4: Potential Errors or Misunderstandings
Common errors include:
- Not cross-multiplying correctly.
- Making mistakes during the expansion (e.g., \(5(x-5) = 5x - 5\) instead of \(5x - 25\)).
- Algebraic mistakes when solving for \(x\).
