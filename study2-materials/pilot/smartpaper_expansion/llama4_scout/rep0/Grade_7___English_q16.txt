My reasoning is based on the simplicity of the question and the fact that writing a personal message is a common task for Grade 7 students. However, some students might struggle with expressing their thoughts coherently, using proper punctuation, or writing in a clear and concise manner, which could lead to losing marks. Additionally, the question does not specify any complex requirements, making it accessible to a significant proportion of students. Nevertheless, factors like handwriting, grammar, and vocabulary might still affect the scores.
