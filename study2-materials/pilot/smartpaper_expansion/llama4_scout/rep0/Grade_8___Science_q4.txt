## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks about the zone of a flame used by a goldsmith and the reason for its use. The rubric specifies that the correct answer is the outermost zone (non-luminous or blue zone) of a flame.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to know about the different zones of a flame and their characteristics. Typically, a flame has three main zones: the innermost zone (dark zone), the middle zone (luminous zone), and the outermost zone (non-luminous or blue zone). The outermost zone is where complete combustion occurs and is the hottest part of the flame.

## 3: Analyze the specific requirement for goldsmiths
Goldsmiths use the outermost zone of the flame because it is the hottest part, which is necessary for melting and shaping metals like gold.

## 4: Consider common misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Identifying the wrong zone of the flame (e.g., the luminous zone).
- Not providing a clear reason or an incorrect reason for why goldsmiths use a specific zone.

## 5: Assess student knowledge at Grade 8 level in India
By Grade 8, students in India have typically covered basic concepts of combustion and
