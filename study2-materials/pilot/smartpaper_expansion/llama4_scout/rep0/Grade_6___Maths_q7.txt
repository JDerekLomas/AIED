## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to calculate the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 pm, given that it was 30°C at 10:00 am and increases by 2°C per hour.

## 2: Identifying Prerequisite Knowledge
Students need to understand basic time calculations (to find the elapsed time) and how to apply a constant rate of change (temperature increase per hour).

## 3: Analyzing the Task
The task involves two main steps: calculating the elapsed time from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm and then using this to find the new temperature.

## 4: Potential Errors or Misunderstandings
Common errors could include:
- Incorrectly calculating the elapsed time (e.g., not accounting for 6 hours correctly).
- Forgetting to add the increased temperature to the initial temperature.
- Misunderstanding the rate of temperature increase.

## 5: Assessing Communication and Prerequisite Knowledge
The question clearly states the initial conditions and the rate of change. The prerequisite knowledge of calculating elapsed time and applying linear growth is typically covered by Grade 6.

## 6: Estimating Student Performance
Given the straightforward nature of the problem and assuming most students have a basic understanding of time
