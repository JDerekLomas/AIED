In India, Grade 7 students are typically 12-13 years old and have a basic understanding of historical events and their impacts. However, for this question, I estimate that only about 30% of students would score full marks. 

The concept of assessing the impact of wars on the economic life of kingdoms requires students to think critically and make connections between historical events and their economic consequences. While some students might have a general idea that wars lead to economic problems, providing a distinct and plausible economic impact could be challenging for many.

Possible errors or misunderstandings that might cause students to lose marks include:

* Not providing a clear or specific economic impact
* Mentioning a non-economic impact (e.g., social or political)
* Not relating the impact to kingdoms specifically

Moreover, the prerequisite knowledge required for this question assumes that students have a basic understanding of historical kingdoms and the consequences of wars, which might not be uniformly present across all students. Given these challenges, I believe 30% is a reasonable estimate of students who would provide a clear and distinct economic impact of wars on kingdoms.
