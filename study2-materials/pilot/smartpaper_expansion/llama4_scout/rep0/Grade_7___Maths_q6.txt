## Step 1: Understand the Prerequisite Knowledge
To solve the given problem, students need to have a basic understanding of mixed fractions, improper fractions, and the process of converting mixed fractions to improper fractions. They also need to know how to multiply fractions.

## 2: Identify the Steps Involved
The problem requires two main steps:
1. Convert the mixed fractions $1 \frac{1}{2}$ and $3 \frac{1}{4}$ into improper fractions.
2. Multiply these improper fractions and express the result as a mixed fraction.

## 3: Conversion of Mixed Fractions to Improper Fractions
- $1 \frac{1}{2} = \frac{(1 \times 2) + 1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$
- $3 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{(3 \times 4) + 1}{4} = \frac{13}{4}$

## 4: Multiplication of Improper Fractions
- $\frac{3}{2} \times \frac{13}{4} = \frac{3 \times 13}{2 \times 4} = \frac{39}{8}$

## 5: Conversion of Improper Fraction to Mixed Fraction
