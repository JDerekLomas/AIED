Reasoning: 
The question is straightforward, requiring students to provide the antonym of "slow". The prerequisite knowledge is basic vocabulary, which students at Grade 6 level in India are expected to possess. However, a few students might not be familiar with the exact opposite or might write a synonym or a related word instead of the correct antonym "fast". Common errors could include providing "quick", "swift", or even a word that describes a related concept but isn't the direct opposite. Despite this, given the simplicity of the question and the emphasis on basic vocabulary at this grade level, a high proportion of students are likely to score full marks.
