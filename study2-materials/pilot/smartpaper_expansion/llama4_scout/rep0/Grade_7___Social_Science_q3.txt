I consider that about 20% of students would be able to clearly articulate the concept of equality as guaranteed in the Indian Constitution and provide a relevant daily life example, or at least one of these two components correctly. The question does provide some guidance on what's expected, but it still requires students to have a good grasp of the concept of equality and the ability to apply it to everyday life. Not all students at this grade level may have fully absorbed this concept in their prior learning, and expressing their thoughts clearly in writing can also be a challenge. Therefore, I estimate a relatively modest proportion of students scoring full marks.
