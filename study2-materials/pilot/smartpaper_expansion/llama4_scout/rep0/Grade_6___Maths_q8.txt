## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks for the area and perimeter of a rectangle with given length (15 cm) and breadth (8 cm). The rubric provided focuses on correctly calculating the area as 120 sq. cm to score full marks. The formulas for area (length * breadth) and perimeter (2 * (length + breadth)) of a rectangle are essential.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to know the formulas for the area and perimeter of a rectangle. For area: Area = length * breadth. For perimeter: Perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth). They also need to understand the units involved (square centimeters for area and centimeters for perimeter).

## 3: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrectly applying the formulas (e.g., using addition instead of multiplication for area).
- Forgetting to use the correct units (e.g., cm for area instead of sq. cm).
- Making calculation mistakes (e.g., 15 * 8 = 100 instead of 120).
- Providing the perimeter instead of the area or vice versa.
- Calculation errors in perimeter (e.g., 2 * (15 + 8) = 2 *
