0.7 

This estimate is based on the assumption that most students at Grade 6 level in India have basic knowledge about traffic rules and their importance, gained through their daily experiences, school teachings, and awareness campaigns. The question is straightforward, asking for two reasons and their impact on the community, which is well within the curriculum for Social Science at this level. However, the exact proportion can depend on factors like the effectiveness of the school's curriculum, the students' exposure to traffic education, and their ability to articulate their thoughts clearly in writing. 

Given that the question allows for any two valid and logical reasons and a simple explanation of how these rules help the community, it is anticipated that a significant portion of students would score full marks, assuming they have a basic understanding of why traffic rules are necessary and can express this understanding adequately. 

Therefore, an estimate of 0.7 seems reasonable, accounting for students who might struggle with articulating their thoughts or coming up with two distinct reasons.
