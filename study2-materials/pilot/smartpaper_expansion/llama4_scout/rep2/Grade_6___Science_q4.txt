0.7 

This estimate considers that most students at Grade 6 level in India are familiar with basic properties of common materials like cotton. They learn about the properties of materials in their science curriculum. Cotton being a natural fiber, its characteristics such as being a good absorber of sweat and allowing air to pass through are commonly understood. However, the clarity of the question and specific examples provided in the rubric can influence students' understanding of what's expected, potentially affecting their scores. Given that, a reasonably optimistic estimate of 0.7 seems appropriate, assuming that a significant portion of students will recall that cotton is breathable or absorbs sweat well, which are critical in hot weather.
