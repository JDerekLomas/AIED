## Step 1: Understand the problem and the rubric
The problem requires students to calculate how far a bus can travel on $5 \frac{3}{4}$ litres of diesel, given that it can travel 10 km on 1 litre of diesel. The correct operation to solve this problem is multiplication. The rubric identifies that the maximum score is 1, implying full marks for a correct answer.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to know how to multiply a whole number by a mixed fraction (or convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction and then multiply) and understand the relationship between distance, fuel consumption, and the given rate (10 km per 1 litre).

## 3: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Potential errors include:
- Not converting the mixed fraction $5 \frac{3}{4}$ to an improper fraction or decimal correctly.
- Forgetting to multiply or adding instead of multiplying.
- Misunderstanding the given rate (10 km per litre) and not applying it correctly.

## 4: Consider the clarity of the question and student knowledge at Grade 7 level
The question seems straightforward and communicates what's expected. At Grade 7, students in India are expected to have basic knowledge of fractions, including mixed
