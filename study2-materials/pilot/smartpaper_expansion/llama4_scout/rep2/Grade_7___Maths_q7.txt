## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks students to compare two values: `1/2` of `3/4` and `2/5` of `2/3`, and to show their calculations. The rubric specifies that to get full marks, students must correctly calculate both values: `1/2` of `3/4` is `3/8`, and `2/5` of `2/3` is `4/15`.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to have a basic understanding of fraction multiplication. To find `1/2` of `3/4`, students must know to multiply `1/2` by `3/4`. Similarly, to find `2/5` of `2/3`, students must multiply `2/5` by `2/3`. This involves multiplying numerators together to get the new numerator and denominators together to get the new denominator.

## 3: Consider common misunderstandings or errors
Common errors might include:
- Incorrectly multiplying fractions (e.g., adding instead of multiplying numerators and denominators).
- Simplifying fractions incorrectly.
- Not comparing the two results to determine which is greater.

## 4: Assess the clarity of
