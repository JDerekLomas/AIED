0.6 

Rationale: By Grade 8, most students in India have a basic understanding of democracy, the concept of Parliament, and its role. However, the question's clarity and the students' ability to articulate their understanding depend on various factors.

The rubric requires students to mention two key points: 
1. Parliament as the law-making body 
2. Representation of the people's will or giving citizens a voice.

Given the curriculum and teaching practices in Indian schools, a significant proportion of students would likely be familiar with these concepts. They might have studied the structure and functions of Parliament, the process of law-making, and the importance of representation in a democratic system.

Common errors that could lead to partial scores include:
- Confusing Parliament with the government or the judiciary.
- Failing to clearly articulate the role of Parliament in representing the people.
- Mentioning only one aspect (either law-making or representation).

Considering these factors, I estimate that about 60% of the students would be able to effectively communicate both required points and score full marks. This could vary based on the school, region, and effectiveness of teaching, but 0.6 seems a reasonable estimate.
