I estimate that about 30% of students would score full marks for this question. This is because while the concept of "human environment" is part of the curriculum, the definition and examples might not be equally grasped by all students due to varying levels of understanding and engagement with the topic. 

Students might lose marks for:
- Providing an incorrect or incomplete definition of human environment.
- Failing to specify how humans modify the natural environment or providing an inappropriate example.

The question is fairly straightforward, but the clarity of communication and prior knowledge can affect scores. Given that these are Grade 7 students in India studying Social Science, they have been introduced to these concepts, but their ability to articulate and apply them can vary. 

Therefore, while a significant portion might understand the basics, not all would meet the full criteria for scoring maximum marks.
