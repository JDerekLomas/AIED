## Step 1: Understand the prerequisites for solving the problem
To solve this problem, students need to know the formulas for the area of a rectangle (length * width) and a square (side * side). They also need to be able to compare the areas and find the difference.

## 2: Assess the difficulty level of the problem for Grade 6 students
The problem seems straightforward and is based on basic geometry formulas that students in Grade 6 are expected to know. The calculations involved are simple multiplication and subtraction.

## 3: Identify potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrectly calculating the area of the rectangle or square.
- Confusing the formulas for the area of a rectangle and a square.
- Not being able to compare the two areas correctly or calculate the difference.

## 4: Evaluate the clarity of the question
The question is clear and provides all necessary information. It specifies the dimensions of both the rectangle and the square and asks for a comparison of their areas.

## 5: Consider the prerequisite knowledge
Students need to have a basic understanding of multiplication and the formulas for the areas of a rectangle and a square. Given that these are fundamental concepts taught in earlier grades, most Grade 6 students in India are
