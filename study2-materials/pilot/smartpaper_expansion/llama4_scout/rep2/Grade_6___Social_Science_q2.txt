Rationale: The question is relatively straightforward and requires minimal prerequisite knowledge. Students in Grade 6 in India are expected to have a basic understanding of medieval Indian history, including notable figures from Rajasthan. Given that the question only requires naming two correct kings and the rubric allows for 0.5 marks for one correct king, it's likely that a significant proportion of students will score full marks. However, some students might not have been exposed to this specific information or might make errors in recalling the names, hence not all students are expected to score full marks. Assuming an average level of prior knowledge and recall ability, I estimate 70% of students will be able to name two correct kings and thus score full marks.
