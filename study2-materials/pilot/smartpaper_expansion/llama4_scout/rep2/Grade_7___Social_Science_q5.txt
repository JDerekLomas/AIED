Reasoning: 

In Grade 7, students are introduced to basic concepts of geology, including the types of rocks and the rock cycle. However, the depth of understanding and the ability to explain processes can vary widely. 

The question requires an understanding of two main processes: weathering (breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces) and erosion/transport (movement of these pieces). Students need to connect these processes to explain how igneous rocks transform into sedimentary rocks.

Potential errors or misunderstandings include:
- Not recognizing that weathering breaks down igneous rocks into sediments.
- Confusing erosion with weathering or not understanding that erosion involves the transport of sediments.
- Failing to explicitly mention the role of erosion/transport in the transformation process.

Given that this is a specific part of the larger rock cycle concept, not all students might recall or understand these steps accurately. The question assumes prerequisite knowledge of rock types and basic geological processes, which while taught, may not be uniformly grasped by all students.

Therefore, estimating that about 30% of students would clearly and accurately describe the transformation of igneous rocks into sedimentary rocks through the processes of weathering and erosion/transport seems reasonable.
