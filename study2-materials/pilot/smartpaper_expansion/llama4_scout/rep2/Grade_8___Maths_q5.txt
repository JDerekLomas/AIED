## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Distributive Property
The question requires students to apply the distributive property to simplify the given expression: `{9/16 xx 4/12} + {9/16 xx (-3/9)}`. The distributive property in this context means factoring out the common factor `9/16` to simplify the expression into `9/16 * (4/12 + (-3/9))`. This step involves basic algebraic manipulation and understanding of fractions.

## 2: Identifying Prerequisite Knowledge
To solve this problem, students need to have a basic understanding of fractions (including how to add and multiply them), and an introduction to the distributive property. Specifically, they should know how to find a common denominator for adding fractions and how to multiply fractions.

## 3: Estimating Student Understanding and Errors
At the Grade 8 level in India, students are typically familiar with fractions, basic algebraic expressions, and the distributive property. However, the application of these concepts can sometimes be challenging. Common errors might include:
- Not recognizing the common factor `9/16`.
- Difficulty in adding fractions with different denominators inside the parentheses.
- Incorrectly applying the distributive property or not applying it at all.
