## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Rubric
The question asks students to analyze a table (which is not provided) about a plant's growth under three different conditions over 10 days. The tasks are to identify the most favorable condition for growth, explain why growth is least in darkness, and name the biological process hindered in darkness. The rubric for part (a) specifies that students must correctly identify 'Full Sunlight' as the most favorable condition to get full marks for that part.

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors or Misunderstandings
Students might lose marks if they:
- Misinterpret the data (if the table shows that another condition results in more growth than 'Full Sunlight', but this seems unlikely given the conditions).
- Fail to understand that 'Full Sunlight' is generally beneficial for plant growth.
- Don't recognize 'darkness' as a condition that would hinder plant growth.
- Are unable to explain why growth is least in darkness.
- Do not know the biological process (photosynthesis) that is hindered in darkness.

## 3: Assessing Communication and Prerequisite Knowledge
The question assumes students understand that plants need sunlight to grow, which is basic knowledge for Grade 6 Science in India. The biological process hindered in
