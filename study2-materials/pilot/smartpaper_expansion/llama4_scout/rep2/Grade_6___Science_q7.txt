I assume that most students at this grade level have a basic understanding of the importance of different food groups for a balanced diet. They might have learned about the various food groups, including fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, in their science classes or through general awareness. 

The question clearly mentions that Kartik has eaten a lot of fruits and vegetables but no milk. Given this information, I expect a significant proportion of students (around 70%) to identify "milk" (or dairy products/calcium) as the missing component in Kartik's diet, thereby scoring full marks. 

However, some students might not recall the significance of dairy products or might not understand the concept of a balanced diet, which could lead to errors. Additionally, a few students might provide a diet chart but fail to clearly identify the missing component in Kartik's diet, which would also result in losing marks. 

Overall, based on my experience with Grade 6 students in India, I estimate that around 70% would score full marks for correctly identifying "milk" as the missing component.
