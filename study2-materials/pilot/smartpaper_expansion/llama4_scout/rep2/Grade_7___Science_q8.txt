To approach this question, let's consider the factors that could influence students' performance:

1. **Understanding of Acids and Bases**: Students in Grade 7 in India are expected to have a basic understanding of acids and bases as part of their science curriculum. They should know that acids and bases are defined by their pH levels, with acids having a pH below 7, bases above 7, and neutral solutions at 7.

2. **Knowledge of Indicators**: The concept of using indicators to determine if a solution is acidic or basic is also part of the curriculum. Students should be familiar with common indicators like litmus (red for acid, blue for base) and the idea that different substances can act as indicators.

3. **Specific Indicators Mentioned - Turmeric and Hibiscus**: 
   - **Turmeric**: It acts as an indicator, turning red or pink in basic solutions and yellow in acidic or neutral solutions. This is because turmeric contains a chemical called curcumin, which is pH-sensitive.
   - **Hibiscus Flower Extract**: It can also act as a pH indicator, generally turning red/pink in acidic conditions and blue/violet in basic conditions.

4. **Potential Errors or Misunderstandings**:
   - Not recognizing
