Rationale: 
The question requires students to have knowledge of natural resources found in Rajasthan and how one of them affects the lives of people. Students in Grade 6 are likely to have a basic understanding of natural resources, but their geographical knowledge about specific resources in Rajasthan might be limited. Given that Rajasthan is a state known for its mineral resources as well as its arid conditions, common natural resources there include water (despite being scarce), marble, copper, sandstone, gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, sunlight for solar energy, and wind for wind energy.

The possible errors or misunderstandings that could cause students to lose marks include:
1. Mentioning natural resources not specifically found in Rajasthan.
2. Failing to explain how one of the mentioned resources influences the lives of people in Rajasthan.

The prerequisite knowledge needed includes both a general understanding of what constitutes natural resources and specific information about resources unique to or significantly present in Rajasthan. Given the general curriculum of Social Science and Geography for Grade 6 in India, it's plausible that around 35% of students, who are typically more attentive or have been exposed to relevant state-specific content, could correctly mention two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one influences the lives of people there.
