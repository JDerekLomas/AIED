## Step 1: Understanding the Prerequisite Knowledge
To solve the given equation `(x-5)/3 = (x-3)/5`, students need to have a basic understanding of algebra, specifically the concept of cross-multiplication to eliminate fractions.

## 2: Identifying the Steps to Solve the Equation
The first step involves cross-multiplying to get `5(x-5) = 3(x-3)`, which is where the maximum score of 1 is allocated according to the rubric. Students then need to expand and solve for `x`, but the question focuses on the cross-multiplication step for the maximum score.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors or Misunderstandings
Common errors or misunderstandings that could cause students to lose marks include:
- Not cross-multiplying correctly (e.g., multiplying within the fractions incorrectly).
- Not understanding how to distribute numbers outside parentheses to terms inside (e.g., `5(x-5)`).
- Algebraic manipulations errors after cross-multiplication.

## 4: Assessing Communication and Prerequisite Knowledge
The question clearly communicates what's expected as it asks to solve for `x` but specifically highlights cross-multiplication for scoring. Prerequisite knowledge includes basic algebraic manipulations and understanding of fractions.
