## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Requirements
The question requires students to find the width and area of a rectangle given its perimeter (32 cm) and length (10 cm). The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by \(P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})\). For full marks, students need to set up the equation \(2 \times (10 + w) = 32\), solve for \(w\) to find the width, and then calculate the area.

## 2: Identifying Prerequisite Knowledge
Students need to know the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle and be able to solve simple linear equations. The formula for the perimeter is \(P = 2(\text{length} + \text{width})\), and they should understand that the area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by \(A = \text{length} \times \text{width}\), though the area calculation is not explicitly required for full marks in this rubric.

## 3: Assessing Potential Challenges
Common errors might include:
- Incorrectly applying the perimeter formula.
- Solving the equation \(2 \times (10 + w) = 32\) incorrectly.
- Not converting the solution for \(w\) into
