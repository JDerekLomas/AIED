## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric.
The question asks students to find angles `x` and `y` for points B and C in a given parallelogram. However, the rubric only awards full marks if the student can find angle `x` as 110 degrees and provide an explanation for it.

## 2: Identify the prerequisite knowledge needed.
To solve this problem, students need to know the properties of a parallelogram, specifically that opposite angles are equal and adjacent angles are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).

## 3: Assess the likelihood of students having the prerequisite knowledge.
By Grade 8, most students in India would have been introduced to basic geometry, including the properties of parallelograms. However, the application of these properties can sometimes be challenging.

## 4: Consider potential errors or misunderstandings.
Common errors might include:
- Forgetting that opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal.
- Not understanding that adjacent angles are supplementary.
- Misinterpreting the given diagram or information about the parallelogram.

## 5: Evaluate the clarity of the question.
The question seems straightforward but lacks a diagram or specific angle measures that are typically provided in such problems. Assuming a standard parallelogram with one angle given (which is often 70 degrees opposite to
