## Step 1: Understanding the task
The task requires students to multiply two mixed fractions and express the answer as a mixed fraction. The specific question is `1 1/2 xx 3 1/4`. To solve this, students need to first convert the mixed fractions into improper fractions, then multiply them, and finally convert the result back into a mixed fraction.

## 2: Identifying prerequisite knowledge
Students need to have a solid understanding of converting mixed fractions to improper fractions and vice versa. They also need to know how to multiply fractions. The conversion involves multiplying the whole number part by the denominator and then adding the numerator, and then putting this result over the denominator. For multiplication of fractions, students need to multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator and the denominators together to get the new denominator.

## 3: Assessing potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors could include:
- Incorrectly converting mixed fractions to improper fractions.
- Multiplying the numerators and denominators incorrectly.
- Failing to simplify or convert the final improper fraction back into a mixed fraction correctly.
- Not following the order of operations.

## 4: Evaluating the clarity of the question and required knowledge
The question clearly states what is expected: to multiply two mixed fractions and express the
