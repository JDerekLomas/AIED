To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks, I must consider several factors:

1. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Students need to be familiar with the basic rights of children in India. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Right to Education Act (RTE) 2009 are crucial here. Common rights include the right to education, protection from child labor, protection from abuse and neglect, and the right to health.

2. **Understanding of the Question**: The question clearly asks for two rights and the importance of one. It implies that the students should have a basic understanding of children's rights and be able to articulate at least two of them.

3. **Potential Errors or Misunderstandings**: 
   - **Lack of Specificity**: Some students might list “rights” that are too general (e.g., “the right to be happy”) or not specifically related to children.
   - **Inaccurate Rights**: Mentioning rights that are not specific to children or not recognized in the Indian context.
   - **Inability to Explain Importance**: Even if students list two correct rights, they might struggle to explain the importance of one, often resorting to vague statements.

Given these considerations and typical classroom performance,
