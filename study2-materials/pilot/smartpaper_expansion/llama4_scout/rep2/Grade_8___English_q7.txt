## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to identify rhyming words from a given stanza. The stanza provided is:
"Him shelter from rain,
And a mouthful of grain,
He wished only to borrow,
He had repay it tomorrow."
The task is to find rhyming words, specifically to pair 'rain' with 'grain'.

## 2: Identifying Rhyming Words
Rhyming words are words that have the same ending sound. In the given stanza, "rain" and "grain" clearly have the same ending sound, making them rhyming words. Another pair could be "borrow" and "tomorrow", but the question focuses on pairing 'rain' with 'grain'.

## 3: Assessing Potential Errors or Misunderstandings
Students might lose marks if they:
- Fail to identify "rain" and "grain" as rhyming words.
- Incorrectly pair other words from the stanza as rhyming words without acknowledging "rain" and "grain".
- Do not understand the concept of rhyming words.

## 4: Evaluating Question Clarity and Prerequisite Knowledge
The question seems clear as it directly asks for rhyming words and provides a stanza.
