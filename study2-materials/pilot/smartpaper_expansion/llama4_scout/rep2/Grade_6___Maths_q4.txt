## Step 1: Understand the prerequisite knowledge needed for the problem.
To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12, 15, and 20, students need to be familiar with the concept of LCM, prime factorization, and the common division method. They should also have basic multiplication and division skills.

## 2: Assess the likelihood of students having the prerequisite knowledge.
Grade 6 students in India are expected to have a basic understanding of factors and multiples from their earlier mathematics education. The concept of LCM is typically introduced in earlier grades, and methods like prime factorization are also covered.

## 3: Identify potential errors or misunderstandings.
Common errors might include:
- Incorrect prime factorization of the numbers.
- Failure to use the correct method for finding LCM (e.g., using the highest common factor instead).
- Incorrect calculation of the LCM from the prime factors.

## 4: Evaluate the clarity of the question and the rubric.
The question clearly asks for the LCM of 12, 15, and 20, and the rubric provides guidance on what is expected for full marks (demonstrating a correct method for finding the LCM).

## 5: Consider the grade level and typical student performance.
At Grade 6, many students would have been
