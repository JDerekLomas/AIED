## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks for the distance a car will cover in 12 liters of petrol given that it covers 55 km in 5 liters of petrol, and to find the mileage (average) the car gives. The rubric provided focuses on correctly finding the distance for 12 liters of petrol, which is 132 km.

## 2: Identify the prerequisite knowledge needed
To solve this problem, students need to understand the concept of proportionality or ratios, specifically how to calculate the distance covered per liter of petrol and then use that to find the distance covered in 12 liters.

## 3: Determine the specific errors or misunderstandings that could cause students to lose marks
Common errors might include:
- Incorrect calculation of the distance covered per liter (e.g., not dividing 55 km by 5 liters correctly).
- Not multiplying the distance covered per liter by 12 liters correctly.
- Forgetting to calculate or misinterpreting what "mileage (average)" means, though the rubric focuses on distance.

## 4: Assess the clarity of the question and the likelihood of students having the prerequisite knowledge
The question seems clear, but students might get confused if they don't understand that they first need to find the
