## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Prerequisite Knowledge
The question requires students to list all the factors of 68. A factor of a number is an integer that can be multiplied by an integer to get the original number. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The prerequisite knowledge needed here is the understanding of what factors are and the ability to find them, which is typically covered in earlier grades. By Grade 6, students in India are expected to have a basic understanding of factors and multiples.

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors or Misunderstandings
Common errors or misunderstandings that could cause students to lose marks include:
- Not knowing what factors are.
- Forgetting to include 1 and the number itself (68) as factors.
- Incorrectly identifying factors, possibly due to a lack of understanding of division or multiplication facts.
- Stopping at prime factors (2 and 17) and not finding the composite factors (4, 34).

## 3: Assessing the Clarity of the Question
The question clearly asks for "all the factors of 68," which communicates what's expected. However, the potential for error exists if students don't understand the concept of factors
