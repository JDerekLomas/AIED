## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks students to find the value of `8 ÷ 7.2` and provides a rubric that suggests converting the division to `80 ÷ 72` is a correct setup to remove the decimal, implying that students should be able to manipulate the numbers to make the division easier.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge needed
Students need to understand basic division, how to work with decimals, and the strategy of converting decimals to make divisions easier (e.g., multiplying both the dividend and divisor by 10 to remove the decimal).

## 3: Consider common errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Not converting 7.2 to a whole number or not making the division easier by removing the decimal.
- Incorrectly converting 7.2 to a fraction or not using a proper method to divide by a decimal.
- Miscalculation during the division process.

## 4: Assess student familiarity with the concept
Grade 7 students in India are typically familiar with basic arithmetic operations including division with decimals. They have usually covered fractions and decimals, and some might have been introduced to percentages. However, the ease with which they apply these concepts to solve problems can vary.
