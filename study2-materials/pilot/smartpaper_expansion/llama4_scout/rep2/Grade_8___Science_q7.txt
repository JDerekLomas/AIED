Rationale: 

The question requires students to understand the concept of decomposition, the role of microorganisms in breaking down organic waste, and its benefits for soil health. Students need to have basic knowledge of the following: 

1. Decomposition process
2. Role of microorganisms 
3. Concept of composting 

While these concepts are part of the science curriculum in India for Grade 8, not all students may recall or apply them accurately. Many might not explain the changes observed or the benefits to soil health in complete detail, leading to partial marks.

Common errors could be: 

- Inability to specify changes noticed (e.g., reduction in waste, change in smell, appearance of compost)
- Lack of clear explanation of decomposition 
- Unawareness of the benefits of composting to soil health

Considering these challenges, a conservative estimate would suggest that around 20% of the students would score full marks, as they might effectively communicate the changes, reasons, and benefits, aligning with the rubric criteria for maximum score.
