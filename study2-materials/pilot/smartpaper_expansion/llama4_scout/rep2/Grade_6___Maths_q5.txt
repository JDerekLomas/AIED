## Step 1: Understand the question requirements
The question asks for the sum of the smallest and largest 5-digit palindrome numbers and their difference. A 5-digit palindrome must read the same forwards and backwards.

## 2: Determine the smallest and largest 5-digit palindromes
The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10,001, and the largest is 99,999.

## 3: Calculate the sum and difference
The sum = 10,001 + 99,999 = 110,000. The difference = 99,999 - 10,001 = 89,998. However, the question only explicitly asks for the sum and the difference but implies that calculating both is necessary for full marks.

## 4: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to understand what a palindrome is, be able to identify the smallest and largest 5-digit numbers that are palindromes, and perform basic addition and subtraction.

## 5: Anticipate common errors
Common errors may include: 
- Incorrectly identifying the smallest or largest 5-digit palindrome.
- Miscalculation of the sum or difference.
- Not understanding the concept of a palindrome.
