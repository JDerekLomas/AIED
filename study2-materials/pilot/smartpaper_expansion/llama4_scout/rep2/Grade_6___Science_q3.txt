## Step 1: Understand the question and rubric
The question asks students to differentiate between living and non-living things by providing two key characteristics for each. The rubric provided gives a maximum score of 0.5 for providing one valid characteristic of living things.

## 2: Identify key characteristics of living and non-living things
Typically, living things are characterized by their ability to grow, breathe/respire, reproduce, and need food, among other traits. Non-living things, on the other hand, do not exhibit these characteristics.

## 3: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Students might struggle to provide two distinct characteristics for living and non-living things. Common errors could include:
- Listing only one characteristic for living or non-living things.
- Providing characteristics that are not universally applicable to all living or non-living things.
- Confusing characteristics of living and non-living things.

## 4: Assess the clarity of the question and expected response
The question seems clear in its requirement for two key characteristics for each living and non-living things. However, the rubric's focus on only one valid characteristic for living things to score 0.5 might confuse students about the completeness of their answers.
