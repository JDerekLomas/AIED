## Step 1: Understand the question and rubric
The question consists of three parts related to the expansion of materials on heating, and the specific focus for maximum score is on identifying Aluminium as the material that expands the most.

## 2: Analyze the potential for errors or misunderstandings
Students may lose marks due to errors such as misreading the table, misunderstanding the concept of expansion, or failing to identify Aluminium correctly from the data provided.

## 3: Assess the clarity of the question
The question seems clear in what is expected, with specific parts (a), (b), and (c) that guide the student on what to answer. However, the table mentioned is not provided, which could affect student performance.

## 4: Evaluate the prerequisite knowledge needed
Students need to understand that materials expand when heated and be familiar with the concept of thermal expansion. They should also have basic knowledge of common materials like metals.

## 5: Consider the students' grade level and likely knowledge
Grade 8 students in India are expected to have a foundational understanding of science, including basic physics concepts like thermal expansion. However, their ability to apply this knowledge can vary.

## 6: Estimate the proportion of students scoring full marks
Given that the maximum score mentioned
