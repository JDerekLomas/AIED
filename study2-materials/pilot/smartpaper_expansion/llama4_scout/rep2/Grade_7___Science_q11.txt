0.7 

My reasoning is based on the simplicity of the question and the prerequisite knowledge that Grade 7 students in India are likely to have. They should be familiar with the concept of evaporation and factors affecting it. The data provided is straightforward, and part (a) of the question is a simple recall of which liquid has the shortest evaporation time. For part (b), students are expected to apply basic concepts about evaporation and possibly the properties of salt solutions versus pure water, which they should have covered in their science curriculum.

Given the straightforward nature of the question and assuming the students have received adequate instruction on related topics, I estimate a relatively high proportion of students would score full marks. However, not all students might perfectly articulate the reason for Liquid C taking longer to evaporate (possibly related to the boiling point elevation or the energy required to evaporate the water from a salt solution), which could affect their score. Nonetheless, a 0.7 estimate reflects a reasonably optimistic expectation of student understanding and application at this level.
