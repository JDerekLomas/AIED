I'm assuming that most students will be able to understand the context of the king's questions and provide a simple reason related to the passage. However, some students might not clearly recall the king's questions or may not be able to think of a valid reason. Others might not explicitly state 'one reason', which could lead to partial marks. At the same time, since this question does not require much critical thinking and can be answered with simple understanding, a relatively high proportion is estimated to score full marks.
