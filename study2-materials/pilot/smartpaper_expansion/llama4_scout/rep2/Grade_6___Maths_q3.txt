Common errors could include not understanding the concept of ascending order, miscomparing numbers, or simply not noticing the significant difference in magnitude between 736 and the other numbers.

## 3: Assess the clarity of the question
The question is straightforward and clearly communicates what is expected: to arrange the given numbers in ascending order.

## 4: Determine the prerequisite knowledge needed
The prerequisite knowledge needed is the ability to compare numbers and understand the concept of ascending order. This is typically introduced in early grades and reinforced through Grade 6.

## 5: Evaluate the likelihood of students having the necessary knowledge
By Grade 6, most students in India are expected to have a good grasp of basic number operations and comparisons, including arranging numbers in ascending or descending order.

## 6: Consider the specific numbers given
The numbers provided are `3367, 5492, 736,
