## Step 1: Understand the question and rubric
The question asks students to calculate the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 pm, given that it was $30^0 C$ at 10:00 am and increases by $2^0 C$ per hour. The rubric specifically mentions calculating the time elapsed from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm as 6 hours for maximum score.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to understand basic time calculations (e.g., from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm is 6 hours) and how to apply a constant rate of change (temperature increase per hour) over a period.

## 3: Consider common errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrectly calculating the elapsed time (e.g., not accounting for the full hours from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm).
- Forgetting to apply the temperature increase per hour.
- Misunderstanding the concept of a constant rate of change.

## 4: Assess the clarity of the question
The question seems clear: it provides a starting temperature, a rate of increase, and asks for the temperature at a specific later time. However, it assumes students understand
