## Step 1: Understand the question and the expected solution
The question requires students to find the cost price (CP) of an item given that its marked price (MP) is ₹1200, a 10% discount is applied, and the shopkeeper still makes an 8% profit. The solution involves first calculating the selling price (SP) after the discount: SP = MP - 10% of MP = ₹1200 - 0.10 * ₹1200 = ₹1080. Then, using the SP and the profit percentage to find the CP: 1080 = CP + 8% of CP = CP * 1.08, which leads to CP = ₹1080 / 1.08 = ₹1000.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge needed
Students need to understand percentages, calculating discounts, and applying profit percentages to find cost prices. Specifically, they should be able to calculate a percentage of a number, apply discounts to marked prices, and use profit percentages to relate selling prices to cost prices.

## 3: Assess common errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include miscalculating the discount amount (e.g., calculating 10% of ₹1200 as 0.1 * 120 =
