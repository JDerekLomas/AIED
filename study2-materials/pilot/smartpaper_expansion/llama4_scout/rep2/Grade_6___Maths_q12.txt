## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks for the minimum number of pencils required to put an equal number of pencils in each of 10 boxes and how many pencils would be in each box. The rubric mentions finding how many pencils would go into each box with the current total: 112 ÷ 10 = 11 remainder 2. To score full marks, students need to demonstrate understanding of division with remainders.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to have a basic understanding of division, specifically division with remainders, and how to interpret the results in context. They also need to understand that to distribute items evenly into groups, the number of items must be divisible by the number of groups or that additional items are needed to make it divisible.

## 3: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Potential errors include:
- Not recognizing that 112 is not divisible by 10.
- Not understanding what the remainder signifies (that 2 pencils are left over).
- Calculating the division but not applying it to find the minimum number of pencils needed for equal distribution.
- Misinterpreting the question to only find how many pencils can be put in each box without considering the minimum needed for equal distribution.
