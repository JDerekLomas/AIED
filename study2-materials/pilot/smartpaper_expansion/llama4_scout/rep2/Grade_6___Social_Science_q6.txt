## Step 1: Understand the question and rubric
The question asks students to differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by providing one example for each. The rubric for full marks requires defining archaeological sources as physical remains/material evidence and providing a correct example.

## 2: Identify potential errors or misunderstandings
Students might lose marks for not clearly defining archaeological sources, providing incorrect examples, or not distinguishing between archaeological and literary sources. Common errors could include confusing the types of sources, providing examples that don't fit the categories (e.g., giving a literary work as an archaeological source), or failing to recognize that archaeological sources are primarily physical.

## 3: Assess the clarity of the question
The question is relatively clear in what it's asking for: a differentiation and examples. However, the clarity might depend on students' prior knowledge of the terms "archaeological sources" and "literary sources."

## 4: Determine prerequisite knowledge needed
Students need to have a basic understanding of history and its sources. Specifically, they should know that historical sources can be categorized into archaeological (or material) sources and literary (or written) sources. They also need to recognize examples of each, such as monuments, coins, or inscriptions for archaeological sources, and books, letters
