To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks for this question, I'll analyze it step by step based on common student understanding and potential areas of confusion.

1. **Understanding the Question**: The question is quite straightforward and observes a common phenomenon related to bread spoilage. It asks for the cause of observable changes (green patches on Day 3, darker patches on Day 5) in bread.

2. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Students need basic understanding of biological processes, particularly those related to microorganisms and their effect on organic materials. This subject matter is generally covered in the curriculum for Grade 8 students in India, likely within the Life Sciences section.

3. **Potential Misunderstandings**: Common errors might stem from misconceptions such as attributing the spoilage to physical or chemical changes rather than biological (e.g., thinking it's because the bread got wet, or referring to oxidation processes that might seem to darken bread).

4. **Experiential Knowledge**: Everyday experiences with bread getting spoiled could aid students in understanding the microbial role in decay. This can vary widely among students.

Given these considerations, I consider the following:
- This question taps into relatively common knowledge area regarding microbes causing food spoilage.
- Most students at Grade 8 level would have a basic
