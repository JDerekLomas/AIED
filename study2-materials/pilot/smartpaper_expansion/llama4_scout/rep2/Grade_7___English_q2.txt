Reasoning: 
The question seems straightforward and refers to a common story ( possibly from NCERT textbooks) where a king announces a reward to find someone who can answer his three questions. At Grade 7 level, many students would have read or heard this story. However, some might not recall it clearly or might misinterpret the reason for the reward. A few potential errors could be: 
- Providing an incorrect reason (e.g., to punish someone, to show wealth, etc.)
- Not recalling the exact story and making something up
- Failing to clearly articulate the reason 

But overall, given that it is a recall-based question and a relatively well-known story, a majority of students would likely get it right.
