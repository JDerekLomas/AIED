I estimate that about 70% of students would score full marks for this question, given their likely familiarity with the basics of the Vedic period from their NCERT Social Science textbook. The question seems straightforward and requires recall of basic information about the Vedic period occupations. However, there's always a chance some students might provide incomplete answers or incorrectly recall information, hence a 30% error rate is assumed.
