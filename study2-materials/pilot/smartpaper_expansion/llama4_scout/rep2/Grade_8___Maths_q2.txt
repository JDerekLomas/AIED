## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks students to find the product of two binomials: `(3a – 2b)` and `(2a + 3b)`. The rubric provided indicates that showing the correct expansion of the product, such as `3a(2a+3b) - 2b(2a+3b)` or `6a² + 9ab - 4ab - 6b²`, is sufficient for full marks.

## 2: Identify the prerequisite knowledge needed
To solve this problem, students need to have knowledge of algebraic expressions, specifically the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials). This includes understanding how to multiply two binomials.

## 3: Consider common errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrect application of the distributive property.
- Not following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
- Algebraic simplification errors, such as incorrectly combining like terms.

## 4: Assess the clarity of the question and expected response
The question is straightforward and clearly asks for the product of two binomials. The rubric gives a clear indication of what is expected for full marks.

## 5: Evaluate the likelihood
