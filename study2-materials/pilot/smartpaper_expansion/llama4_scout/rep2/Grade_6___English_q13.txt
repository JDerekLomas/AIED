Most students in Grade 6 in India are expected to have a good grasp of basic vocabulary, including common antonyms. The word "slow" is a commonly used term, and its opposite, "fast," is widely known. However, a small proportion might be confused due to not understanding the question clearly or not having been exposed to these specific terms in their curriculum yet, or they might mistakenly provide a synonym or another word not recognized as the direct opposite.
