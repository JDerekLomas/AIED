Reasoning: 

The question seems clear, and the task is relatively straightforward. However, students need to understand the king's motivations and demonstrate an understanding of the passage. At Grade 7 level, many students would likely grasp the basic concepts. 

The potential errors or misunderstandings might arise from:
- not reading or understanding the passage correctly
- not clearly articulating their thoughts within the 2-3 sentence limit 
- providing reasons not directly related to the passage.

However, given that the topic seems relevant and likely discussed in class, I estimate around 60% of the students would be able to score full marks, having prerequisite knowledge and being able to express themselves coherently.
