To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks for the given question, let's consider several factors:

1. **Clarity of the Question**: The question is straightforward and includes a simple directive to observe a picture and answer two questions based on it. The first part, (a), asks for a description of what is shown in the picture. The clarity of the question reduces the chance of misunderstandings regarding what is expected.

2. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: For part (a), no specific scientific knowledge is required beyond the ability to observe and describe a scene. The description involves seeing trees being cut and some already felled, which is a common enough scenario that most students would understand without needing specialized knowledge.

3. **Specific Errors or Misunderstandings**: 
   - For part (a), errors might occur if students misdescribe the scene significantly (e.g., describing it as planting trees instead of cutting them down). However, given the straightforward nature of the task, significant misdescription is relatively rare.

4. **Likelihood of Students Having the Prerequisite Knowledge**: 
   - Most Grade 8 students in India would be familiar with scenes of tree cutting, either from real-life experiences or through media and educational materials. The environment and conservation are part of
