## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Prerequisite Knowledge
The question requires students to understand the basic concept of heat transfer, specifically identifying and explaining the process of conduction. For Grade 7 students in India, the prerequisite knowledge includes understanding that heat transfer occurs through conduction, convection, and radiation, but specifically, they should be familiar with conduction as a method of heat transfer through solids.

## 2: Analyzing Part (a) of the Question
Part (a) asks students to name the process of heat transfer responsible for the spoon's handle becoming hot when the spoon is placed in hot tea. The correct answer is "Conduction." Students losing marks on this part might incorrectly identify the process as convection (which involves fluids) or radiation (which involves electromagnetic waves and can occur through a vacuum).

## 3: Analyzing Part (b) of the Question
Part (b) requires a brief explanation of how heat travels from the part of the spoon in the tea to its handle. A correct explanation would involve understanding that in conduction, heat travels through the particles of the substance (in this case, the spoon) as they vibrate and transfer energy from one particle to another.
