## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric
The question asks for the minimum number of chocolates required to distribute equally among 80 students and then to find out how many chocolates each class gets if there are 8 classes with the same number of students. The rubric requires students to find out how many chocolates per student from 300 chocolates, recognize that to distribute equally, they need to round up to the next multiple of 80 (320 chocolates), and then calculate how many chocolates each class gets.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
To solve this problem, students need to have basic division skills, understand the concept of remainders, and be able to find the next multiple of a number. They also need to know how to divide a quantity into equal parts.

## 3: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Not understanding that to distribute chocolates equally, the total number of chocolates must be divisible by the number of students.
- Failing to recognize that 300 chocolates are not enough for equal distribution and not calculating the next multiple of 80.
- Incorrectly calculating the number of chocolates per student or per class.

## 4: Assess the clarity of the question and student knowledge at Grade 8 level
The question
