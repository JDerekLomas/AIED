## Step 1: Understand the question and rubric
The question requires students to multiply two negative integers, -3 and -4, and apply the correct sign rule for multiplication, which states that the product of two negative numbers is positive.

## 2: Identify prerequisite knowledge
Students need to know the multiplication table of 3 and 4, and the rule for multiplying negative numbers. By Grade 7, students in India are expected to have a basic understanding of integers and their operations, including multiplication.

## 3: Analyze potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrectly applying the sign rule (e.g., getting a negative answer).
- Forgetting to multiply the numbers correctly (e.g., getting -7 instead of -3 * -4).
- Making computation errors (e.g., 3*4 = 11 instead of 12).

## 4: Assess clarity of the question and likelihood of prerequisite knowledge
The question is straightforward and clearly communicates what's expected. Given that multiplication of integers and sign rules are typically covered by Grade 7, most students should be familiar with the concepts.

## 5: Estimate proportion of students scoring full marks
Assuming most students have the prerequisite knowledge and the question is clear, the main variable
