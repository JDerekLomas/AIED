## Step 1: Understanding the question and requirements
The question asks for the area and perimeter of a rectangle with given dimensions (length = 15 cm, breadth = 8 cm), but the rubric provided focuses only on the correct calculation of the area as 120 sq. cm to score full marks. The formulas required are area = length * breadth and perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth).

## 2: Identifying potential errors or misunderstandings
Common errors might include:
- Incorrect application of formulas (e.g., using perimeter formula for area or vice versa).
- Miscalculation of the area (e.g., 15 * 8 = 100 instead of 120).
- Failure to provide the answer in the correct units (e.g., sq. cm for area).
- Calculation errors in multiplication or addition.

## 3: Assessing prerequisite knowledge
Students need to know the formulas for the area and perimeter of a rectangle and be able to perform basic multiplication and addition operations. By Grade 6, most students in India are expected to have this basic mathematical knowledge.

## 4: Estimating the proportion of students who would score full marks
Given that the maximum score is 1 for correctly calculating the area as 120 sq. cm, and assuming
