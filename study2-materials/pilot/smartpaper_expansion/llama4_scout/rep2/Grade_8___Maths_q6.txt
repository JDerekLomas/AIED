## Step 1: Understand the problem and what is being asked.
The question asks for the age difference between Rahul and his father after 5 years, given that Rahul is 12 years old and his father is thrice Rahul's age.

## 2: Determine the prerequisite knowledge needed.
The prerequisite knowledge needed includes basic arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition) and understanding of how to calculate age differences over time.

## 3: Identify potential errors or misunderstandings.
Potential errors include incorrect calculation of the father's current age, not accounting for the increase in age over 5 years for both Rahul and his father, or misunderstanding how to calculate the age difference.

## 4: Assess the clarity of the question.
The question is straightforward and clearly states the current ages and the relationship between Rahul's and his father's ages. It also clearly asks for the age difference after 5 years.

## 5: Evaluate the likelihood of students having the necessary knowledge.
Grade 8 students in India are expected to have basic arithmetic skills and problem-solving abilities. Given the simplicity of the calculations required (3 * 12 for the father's age, then adding 5 to both ages and finding the difference), most students should be able to solve this problem.

## 6: Estimate the
