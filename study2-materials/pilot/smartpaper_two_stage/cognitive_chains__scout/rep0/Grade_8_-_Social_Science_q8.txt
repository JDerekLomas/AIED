20

Rationale: 
Considering the attempts provided, only a few students have demonstrated a clear understanding of the key features of the Indian Constitution. Most students have mentioned basic points such as the Constitution being a long book, Dr. Ambedkar being the father of the Constitution, and Fundamental Rights being a key feature. However, their expressions and spellings are often incorrect.

Given that my classroom consists of students with varying abilities in English, I estimate that around 20% of the students would be able to clearly articulate at least one correct feature of the Indian Constitution and express it coherently to score full marks. This could include a range of correct features such as it being the longest written constitution, mentioning Fundamental Rights, secularism, federalism, etc. 

Attempts 1 to 5 demonstrate a spectrum of understanding; most have something correct to offer but express it in a way that might not get them full marks due to language issues or incomplete thoughts. For full marks, students need to demonstrate comprehension beyond just the points mentioned. Therefore, my estimate remains cautious at 20%.
