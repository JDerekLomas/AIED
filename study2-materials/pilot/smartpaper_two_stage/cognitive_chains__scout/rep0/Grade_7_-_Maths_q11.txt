Based on the attempts I've reviewed, I would estimate that around 5-7% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Here's my reasoning:

* Most students attempted to draw a bar graph, but only a few showed a clear understanding of labeling axes, choosing a suitable scale, and plotting bars consistently.
* Some students (e.g., Attempt 3) showed a good understanding of the concept of a bar graph, but made minor mistakes in scaling or labeling.
* A few students (e.g., Attempt 2) demonstrated difficulties with basic graph construction, such as drawing bars of different widths or not labeling axes properly.
* Many students struggled with English, as evident from their writing and sentence construction, which made it harder for them to express their mathematical understanding.

Given the distribution of abilities in my classroom, I believe that only a small proportion of students would be able to produce a well-constructed bar graph with correct labeling, scaling, and axis representation, as well as accurately identify the classes with the maximum and minimum number of children. Therefore, I estimate that around 5-7% of my students would score full marks on this question. 

So, I will say: 6. 

Please consider 6 as the final number.
