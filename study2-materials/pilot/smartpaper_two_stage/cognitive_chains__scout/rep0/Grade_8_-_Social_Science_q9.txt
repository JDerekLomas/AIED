20

I estimate that about 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

In analyzing the attempts provided, I notice that while many students understand that Parliament is a place where leaders sit and make laws, few of them clearly articulate both key points: that Parliament is necessary as the law-making body and/or that it represents the people/their will. Most attempts lack clarity and precision, often due to limitations in English expression and understanding of democratic concepts.

Moreover, based on my experience with the distribution of abilities in my classroom, I expect a relatively small proportion of students to express themselves clearly and accurately in English, while meeting the rubric requirements for full marks. Several attempts still lack explicit mention that parliament represents the people's voice or will in a clear manner, or confuse some aspects of the parliamentary function.

The given attempts largely revolve around simplistic and fragmented ideas. While some convey important rudimentary understandings of the role of parliament, for instance mentioning law-making and representation in an ambiguous form (Attempts 1, 2, 3), others like attempts  (4) and (5) have much clearer but still, one-sided view or the essential explanation and would still depend on exact criteria to see if granted a mark for meeting more conditions based. Attempt  scores can  relate but given standard levels seen. So the estimate stays conservative  at twenty percent.
