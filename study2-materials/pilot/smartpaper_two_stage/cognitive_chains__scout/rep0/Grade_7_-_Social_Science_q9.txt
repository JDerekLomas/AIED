Rationale: 

After analyzing the given attempts, it's clear that most students have some idea about the negative impact of wars on the economy of kingdoms, but their expression and articulation are limited by their grasp of English vocabulary and grammar. Only a few attempts (e.g., Attempt 1 and 3) partially succeed in conveying a clear, distinct economic impact of wars, despite syntax and vocabulary errors.

Many attempts conflate multiple effects, use simplistic language, or express ideas ambiguously. For instance, most attempts mention general consequences such as "people become poor," "kingdom getting poor," or "no money." A few attempts show some capacity to elaborate (e.g., Attempts 2 and 4 mention specifics like soldiers destroying farms and trade stopping).

However, getting full marks for this question requires a clearly identified distinct and plausible economic impact. Therefore, I estimate 15% (or 75 out of 500 students) could potentially get full marks. These would likely be the more competent students whose grasp of English allows them to express a straightforward economic impact clearly.
