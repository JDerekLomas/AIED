Based on the student attempts provided, I would estimate that around 20% of the 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Here's my reasoning:

* Only a few students (Attempts 1, 3, and 5) seem to have a clear understanding of the adaptations of desert plants, mentioning specific features like small or absent leaves, green stems, and deep roots.
* Most students (Attempts 1-5) have some correct ideas, but their explanations are incomplete, simplistic, or contain errors (e.g., vocabulary, grammar, or coherence issues).
* A significant proportion of students seem to be struggling with English literacy, which affects their ability to express their scientific knowledge clearly.
* Even among the better attempts, not all students clearly describe one way a desert plant is specially built or behaves to either save water or get water.

Considering these factors and my experience with the class, I estimate that about 20% of the students would be able to provide a clear and accurate explanation that meets the rubric's requirements, scoring full marks.
