To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks on this question, let's break down the requirements and assess the attempts provided:

1. **Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan:** 
   - All attempts except Attempt 1 explicitly mention two natural resources. Attempt 1 only mentions one resource (stone) and a vague reference to "desert," which isn't a resource but an ecosystem.

2. **Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there:**
   - Attempts 2, 4, and 5 provide a clear explanation of how one of the mentioned resources influences people's lives. Attempt 3 hints at the utility and economic value of marble but does not clearly articulate its influence on people's lives in terms of difficulty, benefit, or daily life impact as directly as Attempts 2, 4, and 5 do.

Given the assessment criteria, let's analyze:

- **Attempts scoring full marks:** Attempts 2, 4, and 5 clearly meet both criteria, and perhaps with some leniency, Attempt 3.

However, based on the broad spectrum of abilities in a typical classroom:

- **Many students struggle with English:** This impacts their ability to articulate thoughts and use proper terminology.
- **Some are competent:** Can follow the question and provide structured answers like Attempts 2, 4, and 5.
- **Few are advanced:** Might provide detailed explanations or creative insights beyond the basic requirements.

Given the simplistic and sometimes imprecise nature of the responses, particularly issues with grammar, vocabulary, and geographical specificity (or accuracy), it's pessimistic to assume a high percentage of full marks.

Given this diversity and based on my experience with similar student cohorts, I estimate:

**Percentage scoring full marks: 15**

This estimate reflects a small proportion of students clearly understanding and accurately articulating two natural resources and their impact on people's lives, considering common challenges with language, geographical knowledge, and depth of explanation.
