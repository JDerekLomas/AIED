12

Rationale: 

Analyzing the attempts:
- Only 3 out of 5 students provided rights that somewhat matched the question (students 1, 3, and 4). 
- Student 2 had "Freedom of speak" instead of "Freedom of speech" which could still count but might not get full marks if it doesn't explicitly state 'speech.' 
- Student 5 referred to 'quality' likely meaning 'equality' in an attempt to list 'Right to quality.'

Considering common errors like spelling mistakes ('ecuality,' 'fredom,' 'equaliti'), incomplete understanding ('Right to freedom'), or misinterpreted vocabulary ('quality' instead of 'equality'), I conclude many students lack precise knowledge.

Full marks require correct identification of two Fundamental Rights with more or less correct phrasing, hence on analyzing standard errors in understanding or representation (mix of fundamentals misspelled), ability mix & teaching considerations I believe likely ~12% get the right phrasing down properly fully given all mentioned to have complete accuracy leaving quite low estimate despite more detailed instructions allowing more flexibility on terms often misused imprecisely interchangeably lowering full accurate representation estimate here conservately based largely upon student provided attempt sampled analysis above described observations.
