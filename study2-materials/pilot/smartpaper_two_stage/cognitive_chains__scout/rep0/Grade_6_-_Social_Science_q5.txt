My reasoning is based on the student attempts provided. Only Student Attempt 2 and Student Attempt 4 clearly and correctly identify the main occupation as "khetibaadi" (agriculture) or "farming" and also provide a relevant key aspect of this occupation. 

Most of the other attempts either partially correct or provide some relevant information but are not clear or accurate enough to score full marks. 

Given this, I estimate around 15% (about 75 students out of 500) would be able to provide a clear and accurate response that would score full marks, considering the distribution of ability in my classroom.
