Rationale: 

Considering the attempts provided, only a few students were able to clearly articulate two main occupations in rural Rajasthan and provide a brief description. Most students mentioned farming (kheti) and some form of animal husbandry (pashu palan/pakshupalan), but their answers were often limited in vocabulary, grammar, and clarity. 

Given that English is often a second language for these students and this might be a challenging question that requires specific knowledge of rural Rajasthan, I estimate that about 20% of my 500 students would be able to provide a clear, well-structured answer that scores full marks. These students would likely have a good command of English and some background knowledge of the topic. 

The majority of students demonstrated some understanding but struggled with language barriers, indicating that they might score partial marks. A smaller proportion might not demonstrate an adequate understanding of the main occupations in rural Rajasthan.
