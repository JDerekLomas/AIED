I arrived at this estimate based on the following reasoning:

1. **Linguistic Challenges**: The question requires students to express a simple sentiment in English, but even so, the examples show that many struggle with basic grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

2. **Variability in Attempts**: The provided attempts demonstrate a range of abilities, from simple and correct expressions to more complex but often flawed ones. Most students are able to convey that they miss their grandmother and want her to visit, but they struggle with proper grammar, tense consistency, and appropriate vocabulary.

3. **Common Errors**: Frequent errors include incorrect use of prepositions (e.g., "come to my home"), incorrect verb tenses ("I am fine"), improper sentence structures ("Please you come"), and misspellings. These errors suggest that a significant portion of the class is still developing basic English skills.

4. **Full Marks Criterion**: To score full marks, a student's message must clearly express missing their grandmother and requesting her to visit soon. Attempts 1 through 5 show that while many students can get close, errors often prevent them from meeting the criteria perfectly.

5. **Classroom Distribution**: In a typical classroom of 500 students, there's usually a distribution where a small percentage are advanced, a larger portion are competent and can follow instructions well, and a significant number struggle with basic concepts. Given the government school context, where English might not be a first language for many, and literacy levels can vary widely, I expect that only a minority would demonstrate enough proficiency to score full marks.

6. **Estimate**: Based on my experience and review of the attempts provided, it seems that around 15% of students might have been able to craft a message that clearly expresses missing their grandmother and requesting a visit without significant errors. This percentage accounts for the likely number of students who have a good enough grasp of English to accomplish the task with near accuracy. 

This assessment reflects not just the linguistic abilities but also the teaching and learning environment where English is often a second or third language, impacting the capability to express simple sentiments in writing effectively.
