Based on the student attempts provided, I would estimate that around 5-7% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The attempts provided demonstrate a range of understanding, but most students are struggling to express themselves clearly in English and to provide coherent answers that reflect a good understanding of the poem. Even the better attempts (e.g. Attempts 3 and 4) are still quite simplistic and lack precise language.

Given that the majority of my students struggle with English, I expect that only a small proportion would be able to articulate a clear and accurate response that would score full marks. Therefore, I estimate that around 5-7% of my students (i.e. 25-35 students out of 500) would score full marks on this question.

 Percentage scoring full marks: 6
