Based on the attempts provided, I would estimate that around 20 students out of 500 would score full marks on this question.

Many students have attempted to answer the question, but most of them have made grammatical errors, used simple vocabulary, and haven't clearly defined weeds and the importance of weeding. Only a few attempts (e.g., Attempt 4 and Attempt 5) have clearly and correctly defined weeds and mentioned the importance of weeding.

Assuming a normal distribution of abilities in the class, I'd place the proportion of students who could clearly articulate a correct definition and score full marks at around 4%. 

Percentage scoring full marks: 4
