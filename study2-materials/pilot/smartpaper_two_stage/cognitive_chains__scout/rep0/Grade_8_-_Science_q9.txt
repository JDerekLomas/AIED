10

Rationale: Based on the student attempts provided, it seems that around 10-20% of students (e.g., Attempts 1-5) have a good understanding of the concept that the chemical fertilizer (urea) will promote faster and taller initial growth compared to the organic manure (gobar khaad). However, not all of these students have expressed their ideas clearly and accurately. 

Most students in my class struggle with expressing their thoughts in English and may not have fully graspable scientific concepts. Therefore, assuming a typical distribution of ability, I estimate around 10% would score full marks, representing those students who are competent and have accurately articulated their understanding.
