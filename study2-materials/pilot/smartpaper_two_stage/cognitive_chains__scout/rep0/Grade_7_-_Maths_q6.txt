## Step 1: Evaluate Student Attempts
To solve the problem and estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks, first evaluate each student's attempt based on the rubric provided.

## 2: Analyze Attempt 1
Student Attempt 1 shows a correct conversion of mixed fractions into improper fractions: \(1 \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}\) and \(3 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{13}{4}\) are not explicitly written but implied through calculation. However, there seems to be confusion in calculation: \(\frac{3}{2} \times \frac{12}{4} = \frac{36}{8}\) is calculated but then expressed as \(4 \frac{4}{8}\), still implying understanding but inaccuracies in simplification.

## 3: Analyze Attempt 2
Student Attempt 2 does not correctly convert \(3 \frac{1}{4}\) into an improper fraction; it incorrectly states \(3 \times 1 + 4 = 7/4\) instead of \(3 \times 4 + 1 = 13/4\). So, a significant error occurs.

## 4: Analyze Attempt 3
Student Attempt 3 accurately converts both mixed fractions into improper fractions: \(1 \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}\) and \(3 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{13}{4}\), then multiplies them to get \(\frac{39}{6}\), and finally converts it to a mixed fraction. This attempt demonstrates full understanding.

## 5: Analyze Attempt 4
Student Attempt 4 also shows accurate conversion: \(1 \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}\) and incorrectly states \(3 \times 1 + 4 = 7/4\) but still got a plausible mixed fraction. The mistake here affects the accuracy.

## 6: Analyze Attempt 5
Student Attempt 5 precisely converts both fractions: \(1 \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}\) and \(3 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{13}{4}\), then accurately multiplies to get \(\frac{39}{6}\), and converts to a mixed fraction correctly.

## 7: Estimate Class Performance
Evaluating from these attempts:
- A few students (Attempts 3 and 5) got it entirely correct by converting to improper fractions accurately, multiplying, and then optionally converting back to mixed fractions.
- Several attempts had misunderstandings in conversion or multiplication.
- Given 500 students, assuming typical distribution: few excel, most struggle, and assuming an average to good understanding from majority but inaccuracies.

## 8: Consider Classroom Distribution
The class distribution usually includes a small number of advanced, a larger number of average, and some struggling students, especially with mathematical conversions and language barriers in an Indian government school setting.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$
