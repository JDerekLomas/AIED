## Step 1: Analyzing Student Attempts
I will analyze each student's attempt to understand their level of understanding and ability to answer the question correctly.

## Step 2: Evaluating Student Attempt 1
Student Attempt 1 shows a good understanding of the concepts: (a) correctly identifies aluminum as expanding the most, (b) explains gaps in railway tracks to prevent bending due to expansion in summer, and (c) recommends copper for its good conductivity and cost-effectiveness.

## 3: Evaluating Student Attempt 2
Student Attempt 2 lacks clarity but shows some understanding: (a) tries to relate aluminum's expansion to its atomic number, (b) mentions gaps for train wheels to accommodate expansion, and (c) incorrectly recommends iron due to its strength.

## 4: Evaluating Student Attempt 3
Student Attempt 3 demonstrates a clear understanding: (a) correctly states aluminum expands the most, (b) explains the purpose of gaps in railway tracks, and (c) recommends iron for being cheap and hard, though it misses the conductivity aspect.

## 5: Evaluating Student Attempt 4
Student Attempt 4 shows a basic understanding: (a) mentions aluminum in relation to heating, (b) explains the role of gaps in tracks, and (c) recommends iron for its strength in electrical wires.

## 6: Evaluating Student Attempt 5
Student Attempt 5 shows a mix of understanding and misconception: (a) attempts to relate aluminum's expansion to a numerical value, (b) explains gaps in tracks correctly, and (c) recommends copper due to personal experience with its use.

## 7: Identifying Common Mistakes and Understanding
Common mistakes include incorrect reasons for recommending a metal for electrical wires (often citing strength over conductivity) and a lack of clear explanation for the expansion properties.

## 8: Assessing English Proficiency and Scientific Knowledge
Many students struggle with English, which affects their ability to articulate scientific concepts clearly. However, some manage to convey their understanding despite this challenge.

## 9: Estimating Full Marks
Given the variety of attempts, it seems that only a few students (like Student Attempt 1) have a complete and correct understanding of all three parts of the question.

## 10: Considering Classroom Distribution
In a typical Indian government school, the distribution of ability ranges from students who struggle with basic concepts to those who grasp them easily. However, English language proficiency significantly impacts the expression of knowledge.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
