15

Here's my reasoning:

* About 30-40 students might have a good understanding of the concept of equality and can express it in simple terms (like attempts 1-5).
* However, only a handful of students (around 10-15) would be able to clearly articulate the concept of equality as guaranteed in the Indian Constitution and provide a relevant daily life example. Even among the attempts provided, only attempts 3 and 2 come close to explaining the concept accurately, and the rest have some errors in grammar, vocabulary, or conceptual understanding.
* Given that my classroom consists of students with varying abilities in English, I estimate about 15% (i.e., 75 students) would be able to write a mostly correct answer. But among those, not all might score full marks. So, I'm conservatively estimating around 15 students out of 500 would score full marks.

Hence, the percentage scoring full marks: 15.
