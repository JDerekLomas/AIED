10

Rationale: Based on the student attempts provided, it appears that many students have difficulty with English language, identifying correct monuments, and providing specific details about their location and significance.

Only Student Attempt 1 seems to correctly identify two monuments (though with limited details), while others often confuse monuments, locations, or reasons for their fame. Specifically:

- Student Attempt 2 misidentifies the second monument (Chittorgarh kila might be correct, but then incorrectly described).
- Student Attempt 3 incorrectly includes Qutub Minar, which is not in Rajasthan.
- Student Attempt 4 mistakenly identifies the Taj Mahal, which is not in Rajasthan.
- Student Attempt 5 also includes the incorrect Qutub Minar.

Considering these errors and the general lack of detailed understanding of the monuments' significance, only a small proportion would likely score full marks. Given my experience with the variability in ability within a classroom of 500 students, I estimate about 10% would accurately complete the task.
