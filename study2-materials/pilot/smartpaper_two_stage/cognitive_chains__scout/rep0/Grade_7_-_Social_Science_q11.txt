Based on the student attempts provided, I can assess the common strengths and weaknesses in their responses. Most students can identify basic differences between public and private healthcare, such as cost and accessibility. However, to score full marks, students need to provide clear, well-structured arguments or examples for both public and private healthcare services.

From the examples given:

- Student Attempt 1 partially fits the criteria but lacks clarity and formal structure.
- Student Attempt 2 lists features but does not clearly articulate them as "valid arguments or examples."
- Student Attempt 3 correctly identifies the two health systems and provides basic features but stays a bit superficial.
- Student Attempt 4 brings in personal experience and elaborates more on both systems but keeps it simple.
- Student Attempt 5 touches upon accessibility, cost, and crowd issues.

Given the entire class has 500 students and considering general language proficiency and understanding of social issues:

- A significant portion struggles with expressing themselves clearly in English.
- Some show basic understanding but lack specific examples or clarity.

Assuming distribution of ability:

- Only a small fraction (~5-10%) would be able to express their thoughts with perfect clarity and structure.
- More (~20-50%) might understand but wouldn't perfectly articulate.

Considering my classroom dynamics, I'm approximating around 5% demonstrate advanced skills to articulate clear, valid complete arguments fitting the rubric described.

Percentage scoring full marks: 5
