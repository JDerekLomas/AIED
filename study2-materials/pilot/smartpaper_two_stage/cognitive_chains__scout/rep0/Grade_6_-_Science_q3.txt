To accurately estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks on the given question, let's analyze their attempts collectively. The question asks for two key characteristics for living and non-living things.

### Analysis of Attempts

Student Attempt 1: Provides minimal characteristics but doesn’t clearly meet the criteria (“Living thing move... and also grow big”).
Student Attempt 2: Correctly identifies one characteristic each for living and non-living things but explicitly gives only one characteristic for each category.
Student Attempt 3: Provides some characteristics lacking clarity and completeness.
Student Attempt 4: Gives one valid characteristic for living and one for non-living and partly addresses growth which can relate to living.
Student Attempt 5: Directly states one and a half characteristics close to what’s needed to score.

### Assessment

Only a few attempts seem relatively on track to getting it close. Even fewer completely hit more than one precise point distinctively separating living and non-living with clarity across. Since a large number barely mention, 
 or poorly communicate needed data effectively.


### Inference Of Classroom 

Assuming heterogeneous data reflecting learning pace & background, considering Indian school setup –  most find Science to be a tricky subject.

Taking average English understanding problems , general difficulties with question phrasing on top general difficulty. lets infer a fairly rounded estimate here reflective not overly positive or highly conservative

Based on analysis and typical Indian Government schools,
