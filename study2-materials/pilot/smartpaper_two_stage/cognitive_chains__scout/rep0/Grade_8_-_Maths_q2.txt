Based on the attempts provided and my experience with the 500 students, I estimate that around 20% of them would score full marks on this question.

Here's my reasoning:

* Only a few students, like Attempt 4, showed a clear understanding of the expansion and the correct application of exponent rules (squaring the variables).
* Attempts like 1 and 2 showed some understanding of the distributive property but lacked attention to detail (e.g., not squaring the variables).
* Attempts like 3 and 5 indicated a lack of understanding of the expansion and/or struggled with signs and exponent rules.

Given that I've taught these students and considering the typical distribution of abilities in my classroom, I estimate that about 1 in 5 students would be able to get the correct answer without any errors. Hence, 20%.
