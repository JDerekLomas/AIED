## Step 1: Understand the question and the rubric for full marks.
The question asks for the distance a bus can travel on $5 \frac{3}{4}$ litres of diesel, given it travels 10 km on 1 litre of diesel. To score full marks, a student must identify the correct operation as multiplication.

## 2: Analyze the student attempts provided.
- Student Attempt 1: Correctly uses multiplication ($10 \times 5 \frac{3}{4}$) and calculates the result, showing an understanding of the operation needed.
- Student Attempt 2: Incorrectly adds and estimates, not using multiplication.
- Student Attempt 3: Incorrectly adds 10 and $5 \frac{3}{4}$, not using multiplication.
- Student Attempt 4: Incorrectly adds and does not properly calculate the multiplication or its result.
- Student Attempt 5: Incorrectly adds 10 and $5 \frac{3}{4}$, showing a misunderstanding of the operation.

## 3: Identify the correct approach.
The correct approach is to multiply 10 km/litre by $5 \frac{3}{4}$ litres. This involves converting $5 \frac{3}{4}$ to an improper fraction ($\frac{23}{4}$) and then multiplying by 10.

## 4: Assess the common mistakes.
Common mistakes include adding instead of multiplying and not properly handling the mixed fraction $5 \frac{3}{4}$. Most students either added or misunderstood how to apply the mixed fraction in the calculation.

## 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks based on experience.
Given the attempts and typical classroom performance, it seems that only a few students demonstrated a clear understanding of needing to multiply. Assuming a normal distribution of ability and considering that many students struggle with applying mathematical operations to word problems, especially those involving fractions, I estimate that around 20% of students might correctly identify and apply the multiplication operation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$
