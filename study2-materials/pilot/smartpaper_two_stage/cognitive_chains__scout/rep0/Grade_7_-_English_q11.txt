Based on the student attempts provided, it seems that most students are struggling to identify the adjective phrase correctly. Only one student attempt (none explicitly, but Attempt 5 seems close) showed some understanding that "tiny" is the adjective. 

Given the examples and my experience with 500 Class 7 students, I estimate around 10 students might understand the concept and identify "tiny" correctly.
