10

As an experienced teacher, I have observed that only a small proportion of students are able to execute mathematical concepts and problem-solving skills effectively. Although some students showed promising attempts, most of them struggled with articulating their thoughts clearly or making calculation mistakes.

The attempts showcased here demonstrate common pitfalls, such as incomplete understanding of division with remainder (resulting in a correct identification of 3 chocolates per student with 60 left over) or calculation errors while finding the next multiple of 80.

However, several students did accurately state that 320 chocolates were needed to distribute equally, reflecting understanding of the concept. Yet errors emerged when processing class-wise distribution. About 1 in 10 students across my entire class demonstrated a comprehensive and precise grasp of these ideas throughout most problems; Therefore, I would estimate around 10% would achieve a perfect score on this particular question on average within the large group.
