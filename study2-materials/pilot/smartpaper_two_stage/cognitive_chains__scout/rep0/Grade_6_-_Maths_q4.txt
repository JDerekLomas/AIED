## Step 1: Analyze the student attempts provided to understand the common methods and mistakes.
The attempts provided show various methods students used to find the LCM of 12, 15, and 20, including prime factorization and the common division method. Most students attempted to use one of these methods but made calculation errors.

## 2: Evaluate the correctness of each attempt to identify the accurate solution.
The correct LCM of 12, 15, and 20 is calculated as follows:
- Prime factorization:
12 = 2^2 * 3
15 = 3 * 5
20 = 2^2 * 5
LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60
- Common division method also yields 60 as the correct answer.

## 3: Assess the attempts for their understanding and application of the LCM concept.
Only Student Attempt 1 correctly calculates the LCM as 60 using prime factorization. Attempts 2 through 5 incorrectly calculate the final LCM as 50, despite correctly outlining the steps for both prime factorization and the division method.

## 4: Consider the class's overall performance and ability distribution.
Given that most attempts (except Attempt 1) were very close but still incorrect due to a calculation mistake, and acknowledging that many students struggle with English and possibly with mathematical concepts, it's reasonable to assume a significant portion of the class might struggle.

## 5: Estimate the proportion of students likely to score full marks based on the provided attempts and classroom experience.
Given 500 students and observing that only 1 out of 5 attempts shown was completely correct, and considering typical distribution of abilities in a classroom where a small fraction tend to excel, a moderate fraction are average, and a significant portion may struggle, estimating the proportion scoring full marks requires considering both the method and calculation accuracy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$
