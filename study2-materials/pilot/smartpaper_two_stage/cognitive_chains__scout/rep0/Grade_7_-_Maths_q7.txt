Given my experience with the variability in understanding and calculation skills among my 500 Class 7 students, I estimate that about 20% would score full marks on this question.

Most students have shown ability to attempt the problem but contain errors in calculation or comparison, as illustrated by the attempts provided. Only a few demonstrate a clear and correct understanding of the operations involved and can accurately compute and compare the values to choose the correct answer.

The common challenges include:

- Misapplication of mathematical operations or incorrect handling of fraction multiplication.
- Inaccurate comparison of fractions, often resorting to incorrect logic or not converting fractions to have a common denominator or finding equivalent decimals.

Therefore, while there are certainly students who grasp these concepts well enough to score full marks, I estimate their number to be on the lower side, reflecting the general struggle with nuanced mathematical concepts among a significant portion of my students.
