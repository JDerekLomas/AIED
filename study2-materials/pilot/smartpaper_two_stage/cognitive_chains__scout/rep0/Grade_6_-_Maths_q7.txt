10

I estimate that only 10% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

Most students (as seen in the provided attempts) are able to calculate the temperature increase and final temperature, but struggle to accurately calculate the time elapsed (6 hours) from 10 am to 4 pm, mistakenly counting it as 5 hours. Given the common errors observed in the student attempts and general classroom experience, I find it reasonable to assume around 10% of students are detail-oriented and precise in their calculations to achieve full marks. 

Hence, my estimated percentage is 10.
