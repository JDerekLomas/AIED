Rationale: 

Most students have attempted to provide two reasons: one related to the color of the clothes and the other related to the properties of cotton fabric. However, only a few students have expressed themselves clearly and scientifically. Even in the provided examples, none of the students have used perfect scientific language, and their answers are somewhat fragmented. Considering the linguistic and scientific challenges that most students face, I estimate that only about 15% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.
