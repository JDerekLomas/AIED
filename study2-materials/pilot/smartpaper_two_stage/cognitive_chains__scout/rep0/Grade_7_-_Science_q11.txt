To arrive at this estimate, I will analyze the student attempts provided.

## Step 1: Analyze Student Attempts for Accuracy and Completeness
Most students correctly identify Liquid A (Petrol) as evaporating the fastest due to its short evaporation time. However, their explanations for why Liquid C (Salt Solution) takes the longest time to evaporate vary but generally revolve around the idea that salt makes the liquid "thick and heavy," hindering evaporation.

## 2: Evaluate Understanding of Evaporation Concepts
Only a few students provide somewhat coherent explanations that align with scientific principles, such as the presence of salt in Liquid C affecting its evaporation rate. However, even in these attempts, there are grammatical errors and misunderstandings.

## 3: Assess Language Challenges
Given that many students struggle with English, as noted from the attempts, it's clear that language barriers significantly impact their ability to articulate scientific concepts accurately.

## 4: Estimate Competence Levels
- A small fraction of students demonstrates a grasp of both parts of the question.
- Most students show some understanding but are limited by language and conceptual clarity.

## 5: Consider Distribution of Ability
In an Indian government school, there's typically a wide range of abilities among students, with many facing challenges in both language and scientific concepts.

## 6: Final Estimation
Given these observations and considering the challenges students face in articulating their knowledge accurately in English, I estimate that only a very small percentage would score full marks, as even partially correct conceptual understanding coupled with correct English expression is rare.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
