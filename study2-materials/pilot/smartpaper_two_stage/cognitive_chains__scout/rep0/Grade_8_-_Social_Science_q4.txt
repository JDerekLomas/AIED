The student attempts show a range of understanding, but most students seem to grasp that Panchayati Raj is related to local governance and development in villages. However, only a few attempts, like Student Attempt 4, come close to accurately and clearly stating the primary role of Panchayati Raj as local self-governance. Even then, vocabulary and phrasing issues might prevent many students from getting full marks.

Given my experience with the variability in English proficiency and conceptual understanding in my classroom, I estimate that only about 5% of my 500 students would be able to clearly and accurately articulate the primary role of Panchayati Raj in a way that aligns with the rubric and earns full marks.
