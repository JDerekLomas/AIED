5

I estimate that only 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

The attempts provided showcase a range of understandings, but most students lack clarity and precision in their explanations. Many struggles with vocabulary, sentence structure, and scientific terminology. Even the better attempts (e.g., Student Attempt 2 and 4) have some inaccuracies or oversimplifications.

Considering the overall quality of these attempts and my experience with teaching and assessing students in this classroom, I believe that a small proportion of students would be able to provide a clear, accurate, and complete explanation that meets the rubric requirements for full marks.
