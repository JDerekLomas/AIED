15

My estimation is based on the attempt examples provided, which showcase varying degrees of understanding. 

About 20% (Attempts 2, 4) seem to have a somewhat clear understanding of place value but may make small errors.
Roughly 10% (Attempt 5) seem to have an almost correct solution but struggle with articulating their reasoning.
The most concerning part is the large number of students (about 60%, including Attempts 1 and 3) who display confusion about basic place values or seem to treat numbers/words unconventionally.

Thus, for an accurate and simple answer as required, I'm assuming 15% or thereabouts, given typical marking generosity and leniency used while testing understanding through an annual examination within a diverse class size with variable reading capabilities
