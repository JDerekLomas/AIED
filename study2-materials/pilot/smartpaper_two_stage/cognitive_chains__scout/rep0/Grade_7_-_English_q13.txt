Based on my experience of marking papers from 500 Class 7 students, I notice that most of them struggle with article usage in English. 

From the given attempts:

- Student Attempt 1 used "an" correctly but didn't use "the" before "zoo".
- Student Attempts 2 and 3 incorrectly used "a" before "elephant".
- Student Attempt 4 missed "the" before "zoo".
- Student Attempt 5 used all the articles correctly.

Given these common errors and assuming a normal distribution of abilities in my classroom, where most students are average, some are below average, and few are above average, I would estimate that around 20% of my students would be able to get all the articles correct.

Therefore, the percentage scoring full marks: 20
