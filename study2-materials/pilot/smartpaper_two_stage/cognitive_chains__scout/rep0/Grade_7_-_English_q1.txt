My reasoning is based on the attempts provided, which seem to reflect the general range of abilities in my class. Only one attempt ( Attempt 4) accurately and fully answers the question, and even that is quite simplistic. The majority of students have some idea of the questions but make small errors in wording or phrasing. Considering the whole class, I estimate that only a very small proportion would be able to write a precise and accurate answer, which in this case I estimate to be around 5%.
