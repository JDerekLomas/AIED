## Step 1: Reviewing the Question and Attempts
The question requires finding the maximum value of a weight that can measure the weight of two bags of fertiliser, with weights of 75 kg and 69 kg, an exact number of times. This translates to finding the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of 75 and 69.

## 2: Analyzing Student Attempts
- Student Attempt 1 correctly identifies that the HCF of 75 and 69 is 3, which is the solution to the problem. The attempt shows understanding of prime factorization.
- Student Attempt 2 also finds the HCF (3) but lists factors, showing a methodical approach.
- Student Attempt 3 mistakenly uses LCM (Least Common Multiple) initially but correctly identifies the common factor as 3.
- Student Attempt 4 understands that for maximum weight to measure both, we consider HCF, listing prime factors correctly to find the HCF as 3.
- Student Attempt 5 incorrectly adds the weights, suggesting a lack of understanding of the problem's requirement for HCF.

## 3: Evaluating Understanding and Errors
Attempts show a mix of understanding and confusion. Most students (Attempts 1, 2, 3, 4) seem to eventually grasp the concept of needing to find the HCF, but with varying degrees of accuracy in explanation and calculation. Attempt 5 clearly demonstrates a misunderstanding of the concept.

## 4: Assessing Classroom Ability Distribution
Given the distribution of ability in the classroom, with many students struggling with English and mathematical concepts, a significant portion might struggle with the abstract concept of HCF and its application.

## 5: Estimating Full Marks
Considering that a substantial number of students might struggle with the mathematical concept and the English comprehension required to understand the question, and observing that about 4 out of 5 attempts shown reflect some level of correct understanding or reasoning leading to the correct answer (though with varying explanations), it's reasonable to infer that not all students would grasp this concept fully.

## 6: Conclusion on Percentage Scoring Full Marks
Assuming an average performance where about 1 in 5 students may not understand or apply the concept correctly due to various difficulties (language, mathematical concepts, following instructions), and considering typical examination conditions where anxiety and time pressures can affect performance, a conservative estimate would place the percentage of students scoring full marks at around 20-25%. However, given typical classroom distributions and without specific statistics on student performance in similar problems, a direct estimation based on these attempts and general teaching experience would suggest a figure that reflects both the understanding shown and the potential pitfalls in a classroom setting.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$
