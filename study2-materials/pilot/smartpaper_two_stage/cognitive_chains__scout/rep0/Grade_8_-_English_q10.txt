20

The reasoning behind this estimation is based on common grammatical errors and the typical distribution of abilities in a classroom.

The correct answer, "He is too weak to walk," requires understanding and correct application of the "too...to" grammar structure. Most students who provided attempts (1 through 5) showed an understanding of the structure but made a common error of repeating "to" or misspelling "too." 

Given that attempts 1 through 5 are nearly identical and all represent a common misunderstanding (repeating "to" or misspelling "too"), I would estimate that roughly 20% of the students might get it entirely correct, assuming a typical distribution of skill where a small fraction of students would have mastered the grammar well enough to apply it accurately without falling into such traps.

The classroom distribution in an Indian government school setting often includes:

- A significant portion of students who struggle with basic English grammar due to various factors, including but not limited to, first language interference, lack of exposure to English outside the classroom, and limited practice.
- A moderate number of students who have a decent grasp but make common errors.
- A smaller number of advanced students who can apply grammar rules accurately.

Therefore, estimating 20% to score full marks seems conservative and acknowledges the likely challenges students might face with English grammar, particularly with less common structures or nuanced details.
