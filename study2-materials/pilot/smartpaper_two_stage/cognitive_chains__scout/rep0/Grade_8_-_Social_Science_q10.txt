My reasoning is based on the quality of the attempts provided. Most students have been able to articulate a basic narrative of the East India Company's rise to power, but there are significant errors in terms of chronology, geography, and conceptual understanding.

Only one of the attempts (Student Attempt 2) clearly and accurately describes the process, mentioning the arrival of the East India Company in 1600, the establishment of factories, and the battles of Plassey and Buxar.

The other attempts reveal various misconceptions and lack of clarity. For example, some students confuse the king who granted permission to the East India Company (Jahangir vs. Mughal king), while others incorrectly locate the first factory (Surat vs. Calcutta).

Given that my classroom consists of 500 students with a range of abilities, I estimate that only a small proportion would be able to produce a response similar in quality to Student Attempt 2.

Therefore, I estimate that 5% of my students would score full marks on this question.
