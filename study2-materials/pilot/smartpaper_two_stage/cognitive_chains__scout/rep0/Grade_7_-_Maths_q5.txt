Based on the student attempts provided, I estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The attempts demonstrate a range of understanding, from basic calculation errors to more robust problem-solving. Attempts 3, 4, and 5 demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and accurate calculations, earning full marks. Attempts 1 and 2 show some errors in calculation or conversion between paise and rupees.

Given the distribution of abilities in my classroom, I expect a small proportion of students to consistently demonstrate strong problem-solving skills and accurate calculations, while many others may struggle with some aspects of the question. Hence, I estimate 20% of students would score full marks.
