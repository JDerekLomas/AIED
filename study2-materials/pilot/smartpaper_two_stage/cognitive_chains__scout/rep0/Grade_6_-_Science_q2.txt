I've considered the attempts provided and taken into account the common mistakes, spelling errors, and grammatical issues that are typical in a government school setting. Many students have demonstrated an understanding of the concept, but their expression and spelling are often incorrect.

To score full marks, students need to correctly spell "Photosynthesis" and provide a coherent answer. Based on the attempts provided, it seems that only a small fraction of students have achieved this level of accuracy.

In my experience, a significant number of students struggle with English, which affects their ability to express scientific concepts accurately. Given the distribution of ability in my classroom, I estimate that around 5% of students would score full marks on this question.
