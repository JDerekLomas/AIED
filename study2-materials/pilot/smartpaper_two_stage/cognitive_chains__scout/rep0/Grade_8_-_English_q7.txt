Rationale: 

Many students struggle with English, especially when it comes to identifying rhyming words. Attempts 1, 3, and 5 demonstrate a clear understanding of the concept, but may have minor errors in spelling (tomoro instead of tomorrow). Attempt 2 shows a good understanding with correct spelling, and Attempt 4 lists all the words but doesn't pair them.

Assuming a normal distribution of ability, I estimate about 20% of 500 students (100 students) would score full marks, as they would accurately pair 'rain' with 'grain' and 'borrow' with 'tomorrow' without any errors.
