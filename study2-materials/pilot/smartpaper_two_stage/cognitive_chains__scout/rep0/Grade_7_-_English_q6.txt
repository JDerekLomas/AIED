My reasoning is based on the attempts provided, which suggest that most students struggle to express themselves in proper English, using simple sentences and basic vocabulary. Even in these attempts, I notice that:

* Most students use very basic vocabulary (e.g., "easy", "simple", "nice", "beautiful") and short sentences.
* There are grammatical errors, repetition of words, and lack of coherence in their writing.
* Few students are able to use more nuanced language to describe the poet's writing style.

Given that these attempts are representative of the overall ability of my 500 students, I estimate that only a very small proportion would be able to score full marks on this question. Specifically, I think around 5% of my students would be able to identify a suitable and relevant word describing the writing style, such as "simple", "descriptive", or another appropriate word.
