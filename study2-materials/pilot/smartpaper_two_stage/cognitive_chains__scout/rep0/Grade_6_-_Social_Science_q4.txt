10

To arrive at this estimate, I considered the following factors:

* Most students were able to mention the desert in Rajasthan, but many struggled with basic English grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.
* Only a few students (Attempts 2 and 5) were able to provide a somewhat clear and accurate description of the desert.
* Many students used simple sentences and basic vocabulary, indicating a struggle with language.
* Some students (Attempts 1, 3, and 4) provided incomplete or inaccurate information, such as not mentioning the correct name of the desert or using overly simplistic descriptions.

Given these observations, I estimate that only about 10% of my 500 students would be able to score full marks on this question, as they would need to clearly and accurately name the Thar Desert (or Marusthali) and provide a brief, coherent description of it.
