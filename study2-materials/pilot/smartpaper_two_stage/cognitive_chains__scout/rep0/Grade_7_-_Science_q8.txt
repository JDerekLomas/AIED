To arrive at this estimate, I considered the following factors:

1. Understanding of the concept: Most students demonstrated some understanding of using turmeric as an indicator, but their explanations were not always clear or scientifically accurate.

2. Scientific accuracy: Attempts 1, 2, 3, and 4 show some degree of scientific understanding, but only a few students provided entirely accurate and clear explanations.

3. Language proficiency: Many students struggled with English, which is evident in their attempts. This limitation likely hindered their ability to articulate their thoughts clearly and accurately.

4. Alternative indicators: Only a few students mentioned using hibiscus flower extract as an alternative indicator, which showed some understanding of the concept.

Given these factors and evaluating the attempts provided, I estimate that around 10% of the 500 students would score full marks on this question. This percentage reflects the proportion of students who demonstrated a clear, scientifically accurate understanding of using turmeric powder and possibly hibiscus flower extract as indicators for acids and bases.
