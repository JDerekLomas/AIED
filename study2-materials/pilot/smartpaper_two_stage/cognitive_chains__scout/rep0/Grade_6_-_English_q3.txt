20

I arrive at this estimate by considering the variety and quality of attempts from the students. 

Attempts 1, 2, and 3 demonstrate some understanding of the sentence structure and basic spelling, although there are errors. Attempt 1 gets the basic idea across but has a minor spelling error ('storry' instead of 'story'). Attempt 2 adds more context and correctly spells 'loved' and 'evening' but makes errors in 'too reed' and 'storys'. Attempt 3 is concise but makes significant spelling errors ('evning' instead of 'evening').

Attempts 4 and 5 show more significant deviations from the expected answer. Attempt 4 confuses the subject's preference ('she like to playing') and doesn't directly address what Riya loved to do. Attempt 5 has multiple issues ('red' instead of 'read', 'siting' instead of 'sitting') and uses a more fragmented structure.

Given the range of abilities and errors present in these attempts, I estimate that around 20% of the 500 students would accurately state that Riya loved to read books in the evening without significant errors, thereby scoring full marks. This reflects a conservative assessment considering the common pitfalls observed and the overall distribution of skills in an average government school setting.
