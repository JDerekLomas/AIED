## Step 1: Review the attempts and identify the correct formula usage
The correct formula for the area of a triangle is given by `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. Let's review each student's attempt to see if they used this formula correctly.

## 2: Analyze Student Attempt 1
Student Attempt 1 uses the formula `= base × height`, missing the `1/2` factor. The answer provided is 48, but it should be 24.

## 3: Analyze Student Attempt 2
Student Attempt 2 uses `length x breadth` instead of the correct terms for a triangle and misses the `1/2` factor.

## 4: Analyze Student Attempt 3
Student Attempt 3 uses the correct terms (`base × hight`) but misses the `1/2` factor in the formula.

## 5: Analyze Student Attempt 4
Student Attempt 4 starts with the correct formula but then remembers to apply the `1/2` factor after initially forgetting it, leading to the correct answer of 24 square cm.

## 6: Analyze Student Attempt 5
Student Attempt 5 uses the correct formula terms but again misses applying the `1/2` factor.

## 7: Estimate the proportion of students who understand the concept
Given that only one student (Attempt 4) out of the five provided examples remembered to include the `1/2` factor correctly in their calculation, and considering the common mistakes such as confusing terms (length, breadth) or forgetting the `1/2` factor, we need to estimate how many out of 500 students would recall and apply the formula correctly.

## 8: Consider classroom ability distribution
In an Indian government school, there's a wide range of abilities. Some students may grasp concepts quickly, while many might struggle with basic formulas, especially if they're not confident in their English or mathematical vocabulary.

## 9: Make an educated estimate
Given these attempts and the typical distribution of abilities, let's assume that around 20-30% of students might have a good grasp of the formula and can apply it correctly. However, considering the mistakes seen and the complexity of remembering and applying the `1/2` factor, a conservative estimate might be necessary.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$
