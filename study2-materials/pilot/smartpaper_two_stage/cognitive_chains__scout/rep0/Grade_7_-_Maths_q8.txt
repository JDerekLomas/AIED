Based on my experience and analyzing the attempts provided, I estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Most students were able to find the mileage (average) of the car correctly, which is 11 km/liter. However, a significant number of students made calculation errors when finding the distance covered in 12 liters of petrol. Some students wrote incorrect calculations, while others made errors in multiplication (e.g., 11 x 12 = 121 or 132, but written incorrectly).

Given the struggles with basic arithmetic operations, English comprehension, and mathematical representation, I conservatively estimate that 20% of my students, who are more competent and confident in math and English, would score full marks on this question.

Percentage scoring full marks: 20
