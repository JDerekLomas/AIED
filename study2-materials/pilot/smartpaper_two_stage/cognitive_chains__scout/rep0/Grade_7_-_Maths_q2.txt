10

My reasoning is based on observing the attempts provided and extrapolating to the larger group of 500 students.

* Only one student (Attempt 1 and Attempt 5) got the correct answer, but their presentation and steps were correct. 
* Students made careless mistakes or showed a lack of understanding of basic algebra.
* Most errors were in calculation (x = 3 instead of x = 2) or copying the answer.
* Few students (Attempts 2 and 3) arrived at the incorrect answer `x = 3`; and one (Attempt 4) showed they understood the process but copied it mechanically.

Considering these patterns, it's realistic to assume about 10% of 500 students may display solid understanding of isolating a variable through basic algebraic manipulations, execute steps correctly and would score full marks on this question.
