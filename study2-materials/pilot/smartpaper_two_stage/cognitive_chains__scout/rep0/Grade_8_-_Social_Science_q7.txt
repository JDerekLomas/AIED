Based on the examples provided and my experience of marking papers from 500 Class 8 students, I would estimate the following:

Percentage scoring full marks: 5

The majority of students have demonstrated some understanding of the Battle of Plassey and its significance, but most of them lack clarity, coherence, and specific details required to score full marks. They have jumbled up various facts, struggled with English vocabulary and grammar, and haven't explicitly established the causal link between the Battle of Plassey and the expansion of British power in India.

Only a few students might have provided a clear, concise, and accurate explanation of how the victory at Plassey led to British dominance over Bengal, such as placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab, to score full marks. Hence, I estimate that around 5% (25 students out of 500) would score full marks on this question.
