20

I have chosen this estimate based on the five attempts provided, which suggest that a significant number of students have a basic understanding of the concept of antonyms but may struggle with spelling, vocabulary, or articulating their answers clearly.

Attempts 1, 2, 3, and 4 demonstrate a clear understanding of the concept that "modern" or "new" is the opposite of "ancient," but some students struggle with spelling ("modren" instead of "modern"), capitalization, or grammatical construction. Attempt 5 is a very straightforward answer.

However, given that I have 500 students and many of them may struggle with basic English language skills, I would not expect more than 20% to get the answer exactly right, with correct spelling and grammar. This estimate reflects a relatively low but still realistic expectation of student performance, considering the challenges many students face in English language learning.
