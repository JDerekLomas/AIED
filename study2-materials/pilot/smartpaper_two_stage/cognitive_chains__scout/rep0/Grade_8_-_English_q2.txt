20

Rationale: 

Analyzing the attempts, I can see that only Attempt 1, 3, and 5 seem to somewhat clearly convey the idea of hearing bird sounds, although they have multiple errors. Attempt 2 and 4 are vague and lack clarity.

Based on my experience with the class, I estimate that around 20% of the students would be able to clearly articulate the idea of hearing bird sounds during sunset, which would score them full marks. This percentage takes into account the common challenges my students face with English grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. Only a small proportion of students have demonstrated a clear understanding of the scene and the required vocabulary to describe it accurately.
