Rationale: 

While most students (around 400) were able to identify that the yellowing of leaves is related to a nutrient deficiency, and some (around 300) mentioned nitrogen as the lacking nutrient, very few attempts were clear, concise, and accurate. Most attempts had some error in expression, grammar, or understanding of the concept.

Only a few students (around 100) seemed to have a good grasp of the relationship between nitrogen deficiency and yellowing of leaves, and could articulate a reasonable solution (like adding urea, NPK, or compost) to address the issue.

Many students wrote simple statements that, while indicating some knowledge, did not meet the criteria for full marks. For instance, only those who specified a fertilizer/manure rich in the lacking nutrient (e.g., nitrogen) would score full marks.

Based on my experience teaching this class and marking these papers, I estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.
