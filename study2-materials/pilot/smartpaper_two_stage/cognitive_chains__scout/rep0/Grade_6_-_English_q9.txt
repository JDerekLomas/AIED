The attempts I have seen suggest a lack of understanding of basic punctuation and capitalization rules. Given the low quality of attempts provided, I do not expect many students to score full marks. Typically, in a government school in India, students struggle with English grammar and punctuation. Most of the attempts I have seen are similar, with only the first letter of the first word capitalized, indicating a limited understanding of capitalization and punctuation rules. Given my experience and the sample attempts, I expect only a few students to have correctly rewritten the sentence. Hence, I estimate 5% of students would score full marks.
