Based on the attempts provided, I estimate that around 5-7 students out of 500 would score full marks. 

The main reasons for this estimate are:

1. Most students faced difficulty in writing coherent sentences and maintaining subject-verb agreement.
2. Few students could express their thoughts clearly and concisely within the given word limit.
3. Vocabulary and grammatical errors were quite common.

Hence, I estimate the percentage of students scoring full marks to be around: 1.2%
