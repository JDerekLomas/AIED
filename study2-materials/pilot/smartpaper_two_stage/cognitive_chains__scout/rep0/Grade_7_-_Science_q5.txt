Rationale: 

Upon analyzing the attempts provided, I notice that only a few students have demonstrated a clear understanding of the difference between autotrophic and heterotrophic modes of nutrition. Even in the better attempts (e.g., Student Attempts 1, 2, and 3), there are still grammatical errors, simplistic vocabulary, and a few misconceptions. 

Many students seem to have a basic grasp of the concepts, but their expression and articulation are limited by their proficiency in English. 

Given that I have 500 students with a range of abilities, I estimate around 15% of them would score full marks. These top students would likely possess both a solid understanding of the scientific concepts and the linguistic skills to express themselves clearly and accurately.
