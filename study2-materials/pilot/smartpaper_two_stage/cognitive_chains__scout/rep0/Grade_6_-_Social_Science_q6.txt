I estimate that only 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

Most students have a basic understanding of the terms "archaeological" and "literary" sources, but their definitions are often incomplete, inaccurate, or limited. The attempts I reviewed reveal common misconceptions, such as:

* Equating archaeological sources with famous monuments like the Taj Mahal (rather than physical remains or material evidence).
* Using simplistic or incorrect examples (e.g., "old things we find in the ground" or "books").
* Struggling with English vocabulary and grammar.

Only a small proportion of students, likely those who are more competent in English and have a better grasp of historical concepts, would be able to provide accurate definitions and relevant examples, thus scoring full marks. Given the distribution of abilities in my classroom, I believe 5% is a reasonable estimate.
