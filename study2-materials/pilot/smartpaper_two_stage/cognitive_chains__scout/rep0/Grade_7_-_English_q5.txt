I have considered all the provided student attempts and assessed them against the rubric for full marks. The attempts show a range of understanding, with some students accurately describing the squirrel's tail as like a "question mark" but often with less accurate or incomplete descriptions of other details.

Attempts 1, 2, 4, and 5 correctly mention the tail resembling a "question mark," though they may inaccurately describe or omit other details such as the tail's color or the squirrel's actions. Attempt 3 also mentions the tail's shape but doesn't exactly use the term "question mark."

Given this, it seems about half of the students demonstrated a correct understanding similar to these attempts. However, to account for those who might struggle more with language or comprehension and assuming a normal distribution of ability, I estimate 25% of my 500 students would accurately and fully answer the question, securing full marks.
