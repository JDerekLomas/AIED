To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks on this question, let's analyze the attempts provided, considering the language skills, understanding of the concept, and ability to articulate thoughts clearly.

## Step 1: Understand the Question and Rubric
The question is about identifying a plant's special mode of nutrition (insectivorous), understanding why it traps insects despite being able to perform photosynthesis (because it grows in nitrogen-deficient soil), and providing another example of such a plant. The rubric for full marks seems to require accurate identification of the mode of nutrition as "insectivorous" and possibly accurate answers for parts (b) and (c).

## 2: Analyze Student Attempts
- **Student Attempt 1**: Shows a basic understanding but has grammatical errors and uses "insecter plant mode" and "venus fly plant."
- **Student Attempt 2**: Understands it's an insect-eating plant but mistakenly identifies "Sun flower plant" as an example.
- **Student Attempt 3**: Has a reasonable understanding, uses "insects eating," and incorrectly identifies "Sun flower plant."
- **Student Attempt 4**: Clearly states the plant eats insects for nutrition, understands the need for extra nitrogen, and correctly identifies "Venus-fly" as an example.
- **Student Attempt 5**: Demonstrates a good understanding of the plant's need for insect nutrients due to poor soil, and identifies "venus trap flower."

## 3: Determine Requirements for Full Marks
For full marks, a student must:
1. Correctly identify the mode of nutrition as insectivorous.
2. Explain the need to trap insects due to nitrogen deficiency in the soil.
3. Provide another example like Venus flytrap.

## 4: Assess Language and Scientific Understanding
Many students struggle with English, which affects their ability to articulate scientific concepts clearly. However, some attempts show a clear understanding of the concept despite language barriers.

## 5: Estimate Percentage Scoring Full Marks
Given the attempts, only a few demonstrate a clear, accurate understanding of all parts of the question in scientifically correct terms and with correct English. Assuming a distribution of abilities:
- About 10-15 students might have a good grasp of English and the concept.
- A few more might understand the concept but struggle to express it.

## 6: Conclusion
Considering the challenges students face with English and the scientific understanding required, it's conservative to estimate that around 5-10% of 500 students would score full marks, given that only a couple of the provided attempts closely align with what would be required for full marks, and assuming these represent the upper echelons of understanding and articulation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
