Based on the student attempts provided, I would estimate that around 15% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The correct calculation for SP is ₹1080, but only Student Attempt 5 gets it partially correct (calculating discount correctly and then finding SP). However, even Student Attempt 5 incorrectly calculates the CP.

Most students seem to struggle with applying the discount correctly, calculating SP, and then finding CP using the profit percentage. 

So, 15%.
