5

I estimate that only 5 students out of 500 would score full marks on this question. This is based on the examples provided, which show that even when students have some idea of the concepts, their expression and accuracy are often compromised by limitations in English language proficiency and understanding of the subject matter.

Most students have a basic understanding that vitamins and minerals are good for health and help protect against diseases, but their explanations are often simplistic, incomplete, or awkwardly phrased. Few students are able to express themselves clearly and accurately, and almost none provide both a correct explanation and accurate examples of deficiency diseases.

Given the distribution of abilities in my classroom, I expect a small proportion of students to perform well on this question, but not enough to warrant a higher percentage than 5%.
