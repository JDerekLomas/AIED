20

Rationale: 

Analyzing the student attempts, I notice that only Student Attempt 3 and Student Attempt 5 correctly arrange the numbers in ascending order and clearly justify their ordering. These students demonstrate an understanding of the concept and effectively use their mathematical knowledge to solve the problem.

However, some students (like Student Attempt 1 and 2) either list the numbers in a generally correct order but don't take the time to ensure their accuracy or display an immature understanding of mathematical sequence.

On the other hand, most students demonstrate an embryonic understanding. Many struggle to adequately rationalize the placement, usually basing their reasoning on digit count (as seen in Attempts 4 and 5).

Given this wide distribution of capabilities in mathematical problem-solving and written expression among my students, coupled with common challenges my students face with following instructions precisely and articulating their reasonings, I conclude a conservative 20% would attain full marks, exhibiting confident comprehension and proper application.
