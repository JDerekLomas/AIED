Based on the student attempts provided, I would estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Here's my reasoning:

* Most students have attempted to provide some ideas on how to improve transparency in governance, but only a few have been able to articulate clear, relevant, and plausible suggestions.
* Some students have demonstrated a good understanding of concepts like RTI, transparency, and corruption, but their language skills and ability to express themselves clearly are limited.
* A few students have provided ideas that are close to the expected answer, such as putting government information online or making files accessible to the public, but may not have expressed them in a clear and concise manner.

Considering the distribution of ability in my classroom, I would estimate that around 20% of students have the language skills, conceptual understanding, and ability to express themselves clearly enough to score full marks on this question. This means that out of 500 students, approximately 100 students would score full marks.

So, the percentage scoring full marks is: 20%
