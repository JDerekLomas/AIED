My reasoning is as follows:

* Only a few students (Attempt 3) correctly calculated the area of both the rectangle (`5 x 4 = 20`) and the square (`5 x 5 = 25`).
* Most students incorrectly calculated the area of either the rectangle, the square, or both.
* Many students struggled with basic arithmetic operations, such as multiplication and subtraction.
* Some students also showed a lack of understanding of the formulae for the area of a rectangle and a square.

Given the common errors and difficulties demonstrated in the attempts, I estimate that only about 10% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. These students would likely be the more advanced ones who have a good grasp of basic mathematical concepts and operations.
