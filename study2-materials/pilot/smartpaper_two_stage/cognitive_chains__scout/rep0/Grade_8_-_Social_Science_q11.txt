12

I arrived at this estimate by considering the following factors:

* Most students have attempted to answer the question and provide examples, showing some understanding of the topic.
* However, the answers vary in clarity, coherence, and accuracy, with many students struggling with English grammar and vocabulary.
* Only a few students have provided clear and distinct examples, such as the impact of forest laws, loss of land, and economic exploitation.
* Many students have mentioned key points, but their answers are not well-structured or detailed enough to score full marks.

Assuming a normal distribution of ability in the classroom, I estimate that around 12% of the students (about 60 out of 500) would have provided clear, accurate, and well-structured answers that score full marks. This estimate takes into account the struggles with English and the varying levels of understanding among the students.
