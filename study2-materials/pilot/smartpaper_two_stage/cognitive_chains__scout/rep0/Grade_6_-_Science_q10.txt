20

I estimate that about 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

My reasoning is based on the following:

- Many students struggle with English, which affects their ability to comprehend and express scientific concepts clearly.
- The attempts provided show a range of understanding, but most students have gaps in their knowledge or expression.
- Only a few students correctly identified 'full sunlight' as the most favorable condition and showed a basic understanding of the process (photosynthesis) and its importance for plant growth.
- A significant number of students used incorrect terminology (e.g., "photo-shanti-sis", "Potointheis", "Photocenthesis") or had incomplete explanations, which would not score full marks.

Considering the overall ability distribution in my classroom, I believe 20% would be a generous estimate of students who could provide accurate, complete, and clearly expressed answers to score full marks.
