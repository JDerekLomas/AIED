Considering the attempts provided and my experience with the Class 7 students, I would estimate that around 20% of the students would score full marks on this question.

The attempts provided show a mix of correct and incorrect solutions, and even among the correct ones, there are variations in the presentation and accuracy. Attempts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 demonstrate different levels of understanding and problem-solving skills.

In my experience, about 20-25% of students in a government school setting tend to grasp mathematical concepts well and apply them correctly. However, a significant proportion struggle with English comprehension, formula application, or computational accuracy.

Assuming a typical distribution of abilities in my classroom, I would estimate that 20% of the 500 students, i.e., 100 students, would score full marks on this question.

Percentage scoring full marks: 20
