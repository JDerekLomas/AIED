My reasoning is based on the common spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and language proficiency issues evident in the provided attempts. 

Most students have attempted to answer the question and provided meanings close to the correct answer. However, their spelling and writing skills are not up to the mark. 

- "breez", "brij", "brege", and "Breze" are misspellings of the word "breeze". 
- Most of the students were able to relate "a light wind" to the concept of "hawa" in their local language.

Considering the typical distribution of abilities in my class, I'd say around 15% of the students would write the correct answer "breeze" with correct spelling and context, thus scoring full marks. 

This estimate reflects a conservative assessment, given the common challenges students face with English language skills in our school.
