Based on the attempts provided, I estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The majority of the attempts show a good effort to describe the scene, but they lack clarity, grammatical accuracy, and precision in using vocabulary. Some attempts (e.g., Student Attempt 1, 3, and 5) seem to hint at the presence of both orange and pink colors, but they're not explicitly stated together. A few attempts (e.g., Student Attempt 2 and 4) come close to describing the phenomenon accurately.

Given that English proficiency is a significant challenge for many students in our government school, I expect a relatively low percentage of students to articulate their thoughts clearly and accurately to score full marks. However, a notable number of students would still manage to convey the basic idea, which is why I'm estimating 20% to score full marks.
