Given my experience with the 500 Class 7 students and analyzing the provided attempts, I notice a range of understanding and expression. Many of the students have provided responses that touch upon 1 or 2 points regarding the significance of the Himalayas to the Indian subcontinent, but few of these responses are fully articulated, precise, and clear.

The full marks for this question would presumably be awarded to students who can clearly and accurately state two distinct and plausible points highlighting the significant impact or role of the Himalayas for the Indian subcontinent. 

Observations:
- Most students attempt to mention two points (like stopping cold winds and providing river water).
- However, articulation, coherence, and precision vary significantly across these attempts. Many struggle with basic English grammar and spelling.

Assuming:
- A normal distribution of student abilities,
- A common challenge with articulating thoughts clearly in English,
- A limited proportion of students being advanced and thus articulate,

From my estimated distribution of class abilities, here's my best-estimate:

**5%** 

Most students made some attempt to address the question, but the criteria for full marks require clear articulation, accuracy, and distinction of points. Therefore, it seems only a small proportion could fully meet these expectations, mainly because clear expression in English and having two well-thought-out points seems challenging for many.
