My reasoning:

* About 20-25 students have shown a good understanding of division, remainder, and can articulate their thoughts clearly (Attempts 1, 2, 3, 4). 
* A few students who got the correct remainder and quotient were still unable to express what it means in the context of the question.
* The most common errors were misinterpreting the remainder or not being able to calculate the division accurately.
* A significant portion of students (roughly 60-70%) displayed a more superficial understanding, where they might have written down an almost correct procedure, but could not reason or compute accurately.
* A small proportion (~5-10%) struggled significantly and provided minimal or unrelated responses.

Hence, estimating around 15% (or 75 students) out of 500 students could score full marks. This aligns with my general experience, where a small but notable fraction of students usually perform well on a given task, while the majority struggle with nuanced understanding or computational accuracy.
