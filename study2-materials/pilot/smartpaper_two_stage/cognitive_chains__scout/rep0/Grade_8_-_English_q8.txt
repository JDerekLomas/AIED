5

I estimate that only 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

The attempts I've seen demonstrate a common pattern of errors, such as incorrect verb forms (e.g., "prepare" instead of "prepared" or "is prepared"), incorrect use of articles, and inconsistent capitalization. 

Most students have been able to attempt the sentence conversion, but their understanding of passive voice, verb tenses, and grammatical structures seems limited. 

Only a few students, like the one who produced Attempt 5, showed a good grasp of the passive voice construction. However, even in Attempt 5, there was no perfect answer; the student didn't get the sentence B correct.

Given these observations, it seems unlikely that more than 5% of my students would get full marks on this question.
