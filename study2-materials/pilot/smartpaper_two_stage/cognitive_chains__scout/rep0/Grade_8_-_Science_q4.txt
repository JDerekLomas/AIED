Based on the attempts provided, I would estimate that around 10-15% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Here's my reasoning:

* Only a few students ( Attempts 3 and 4) were able to express themselves clearly and accurately, using correct vocabulary and grammar.
* Most students (Attempts 1, 2, and 5) struggled with spelling, grammar, and vocabulary, but still managed to convey the basic idea that the goldsmith uses the outer zone of the flame because it is hot and blue.
* However, only a small proportion of students would be able to write a clear, concise, and accurate answer that would fetch them full marks.

Considering the distribution of ability in my classroom, I would place the estimate at 12%. This reflects the challenges my students face with English language proficiency, as well as their varying levels of understanding of scientific concepts.
