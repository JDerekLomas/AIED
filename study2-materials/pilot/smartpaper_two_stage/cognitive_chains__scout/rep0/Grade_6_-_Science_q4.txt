Rationale: Based on the attempts provided, it's clear that many students have a basic understanding of why cotton clothes are preferred in summer, but their ability to articulate this understanding in written English, using scientifically correct terminology, is limited.

Attempts 1 and 2 demonstrate a very basic understanding and poor command of English. Attempts 3, 4, and 5 show a better understanding, but only Attempt 4 accurately identifies a property of cotton (it drinks all sweat from the body) that is scientifically correct.

However, not all students would be able to express themselves as clearly and correctly as Attempt 4. Considering the distribution of ability in a typical government school classroom in India, I estimate that only about 25% of students would be able to clearly identify a correct property of cotton (such as being a good absorber of water/sweat or being porous/allowing air to pass through) and write it down in English. 

Many students may have the conceptual understanding but struggle to express it in English or in a scientifically correct manner. Therefore, I estimate that 25% of 500 students, which is 125 students, would score full marks on this question. As a percentage, this is 25%.
