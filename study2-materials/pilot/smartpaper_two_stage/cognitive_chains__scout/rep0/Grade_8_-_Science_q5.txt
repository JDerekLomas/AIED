Rationale: Based on the student attempts provided, it appears that many students have confusion regarding the classification of wheat and paddy rice as kharif or rabi crops, and the seasons in which they are grown. Even basic information seems to be mixed up. 

From my experience, I have observed that understanding of such concepts and correct usage of English terms can be a significant challenge for a substantial number of students. While some students can accurately recall and write this information, a larger proportion struggles with details and accurate articulation in English.

Assuming a typical distribution of ability in my classroom:

- A few students (advanced) might have both the conceptual understanding and the linguistic ability to answer correctly (might be around 5-10%).
- Some students (competent) might have either the correct concept or the linguistic ability, but not necessarily both (could be around 20-30%).
- Many students (struggling) might not have a clear understanding of the concepts or the language skills to express them accurately (approximately 60-70%).

Considering these factors, and seeing how poorly the example attempts align with the correct answers (wheat is a rabi crop grown in the winter season; paddy rice is a kharif crop grown in the rainy season), I estimate that about 10% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.
