Based on the attempts provided, I estimate that around 10-15% of my students would score full marks on this question. 

Although some students have shown a clear understanding of the concept of conduction and heat transfer, their answers are often marred by poor English, spelling mistakes, and grammatical errors. For instance, Student Attempt 4 demonstrates a good understanding of the concept, but I suspect that the teacher would deduct marks for spelling and grammar errors. 

Most students have displayed difficulties in articulating their thoughts clearly in English, and it's likely that only a small fraction of my 500 students would be able to express their knowledge accurately and precisely to score full marks. Assuming a typical bell-curve distribution of abilities, I conservatively estimate the percentage of students scoring full marks to be around 10%.
