5

I estimate that only 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

Most students have attempted to answer the question but their responses lack clear explanations and coherent English. Few have provided a well-structured answer that fully addresses both parts of the question. 

The majority of students have provided basic, short answers that mention the importance of money and digital payment systems, but they often lack depth, clarity, and grammatical accuracy. 

Only a few advanced students have shown a good understanding of the concepts and can express themselves clearly in English, and hence, are likely to score full marks. 

Hence, I believe that only a very small proportion of students, i.e., 5% would score full marks on this question.
