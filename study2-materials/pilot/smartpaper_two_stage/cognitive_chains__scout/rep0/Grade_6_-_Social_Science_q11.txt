My reasoning: 

After reviewing the attempts, I notice that most students provide some valid reasons for following traffic rules, but they struggle with:

* Expressing themselves clearly in English
* Providing two distinct reasons
* Elaborating on how following rules helps the community

Only a few students come close to providing two clear reasons and a brief explanation of how it benefits the community. 

Most attempts are simplistic, lack coherence, and use basic vocabulary. A significant number of students also make grammatical errors. Considering the distribution of abilities in my class, I estimate that only about 5 students out of 500 would be able to clearly articulate two distinct reasons and provide a coherent explanation of how following traffic rules benefits the community, thereby scoring full marks.

This estimate takes into account the linguistic and cognitive challenges that many of my students face, as well as the overall quality of the attempts I have reviewed.

The percentage scoring full marks is: 5.
