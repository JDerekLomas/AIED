This estimate is based on the varied attempts provided, which show a range of understanding and expression. Most attempts identify a key feature, such as the drainage system or town planning, but express it with limited vocabulary and grammatical errors. Few attempts, if any, clearly and accurately describe a key feature without significant errors in language or content. Given the typical distribution of abilities in a classroom, especially considering the challenges many students face with English, I estimate that only a very small percentage would score full marks.
