Based on the attempts provided, I'd estimate that around 20% of the 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Here's my reasoning:

* Most students (4 out of 5 attempts) correctly identified the smallest and largest 5-digit palindromes as 10001 and 99999, respectively.
* The sum and difference calculations were also correct for most students.
* However, only one student (Attempt 3) correctly calculated the sum as 109990, and even they wrote 110000 is not mentioned but 3 students got 109990.Attempt 1, 2 and 4  has 109910.
* A few students (Attempts 1, 2, 4, and 5) had minor calculation errors or incorrect notation.
* Given that many students struggle with English and mathematical concepts, I assume a relatively low proportion of students would score full marks.

Considering the distribution of abilities in my classroom, I estimate that 20% of students would score full marks, which translates to:

100 x (20/100) = 20%

So, the answer is: 20
