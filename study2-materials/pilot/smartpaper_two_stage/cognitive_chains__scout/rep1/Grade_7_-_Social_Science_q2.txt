To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks on this question, let's first analyze the student attempts provided.

## Step 1: Reviewing the Question and Rubric
The question asks for a definition of 'human environment' and an example of how humans modify the natural environment, with a maximum score of 0.5. A full score requires a correct definition of human environment.

## 2: Understanding the Definition Requirement
A correct definition of human environment could be something like "the environment created by human beings for their needs, including interactions, activities, and creations."

## 3: Evaluating Student Attempts
- Student Attempt 1: Incorrect definition and example; doesn't clearly convey human environment concept.
- Student Attempt 2: Partially correct definition but lacks clarity and uses "modify nature" correctly but simply.
- Student Attempt 3: Correctly identifies human environment and provides an example of modifying nature.
- Student Attempt 4: Close but definition could be stronger; example is clear.
- Student Attempt 5: Clear definition and correct example of modifying natural environment.

## 4: Assessing Language Skills and Concept Understanding
Many students struggle with English, which is evident in the attempts. However, some demonstrated an understanding of the concept despite linguistic challenges.

## 5: Estimating Full Marks
Given 500 students and considering the distribution of ability:
- Advanced students might clearly and correctly define and provide an example (like Attempt 5).
- Competent students might get close (like Attempts 3 and 4).
- Struggling students would have difficulty articulating both correctly.

## 6: Judging Proportions
Assuming a typical distribution where a small fraction are advanced, a larger fraction are competent, and the remainder struggle:
- Only a few students provided responses that closely matched or could be considered complete for full marks (Attempts 3, 4, 5).

## 7: Conclusion Based on Experience
Given my experience with such assessments, I estimate that roughly 5-10% of students typically demonstrate a clear understanding and ability to express it in writing, considering the constraints of language proficiency.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
