5

I estimate that only 5% of my 500 students, i.e., 25 students would score full marks on this question. This is because most of the students have shown a lack of proficiency in writing a coherent paragraph, using correct grammar, and expressing their thoughts clearly. Even in the attempts provided, there are errors in verb tense, sentence structure, and vocabulary. Only a small proportion of students are likely to have the skills to craft a well-structured and grammatically correct paragraph that meets the requirements of the rubric.
