## Step 1: Analyze the question and the rubric
The question requires students to find out how far a bus can travel on \(5 \frac{3}{4}\) litres of diesel, given that it travels 10 km on 1 litre of diesel. The correct operation to solve this problem is multiplication. The rubric specifies that identifying the correct operation (multiplication) is worth the maximum score of 1.

## Step 2: Evaluate Student Attempt 1
Student Attempt 1 incorrectly adds 10 km five times and then adds 3/4 as 3, resulting in an incorrect answer of 53 km. This student does not demonstrate an understanding of the correct operation or mixed fractions.

## 3: Evaluate Student Attempt 2
Student Attempt 2 converts the mixed fraction to an improper fraction (\( \frac{23}{4} \)) and then attempts to calculate the distance by adding 10 to \( \frac{23}{4} \), which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to multiply 10 by \( 5 \frac{3}{4} \) or \( \frac{23}{4} \).

## 4: Evaluate Student Attempt 3
Student Attempt 3 correctly converts \( 5 \frac{3}{4} \) to an improper fraction (\( \frac{23}{4} \)) and then multiplies 10 by \( \frac{23}{4} \) to get \( \frac{230}{4} \) or 57.5 km. However, the answer is doubted with "maybe." This attempt shows understanding but with a lack of confidence.

## 5: Evaluate Student Attempt 4
Student Attempt 4 correctly converts \( 5 \frac{3}{4} \) to an improper fraction (\( \frac{23}{4} \)) and then multiplies 10 by \( \frac{23}{4} \) to get \( \frac{190}{4} \) or 47.5 km. This shows a clear understanding of the correct operation.

## 6: Evaluate Student Attempt 5
Student Attempt 5 correctly converts \( 5 \frac{3}{4} \) to an improper fraction (\( \frac{23}{4} \)) but then incorrectly calculates the distance as 15.7 km, which seems to be a miscalculation. The correct calculation should be \( 10 \times \frac{23}{4} \).

## 7: Assess the understanding of the class
Given the attempts, only a few students (Attempts 3, 4) clearly demonstrate an understanding of converting mixed fractions to improper fractions and then applying the correct operation (multiplication) to solve the problem. Many students struggle with either the concept of mixed fractions, the operation required, or both.

## 8: Estimate the proportion of students scoring full marks
In a government school in India, there's a wide range of abilities. However, based on these attempts, it seems that only a small fraction of students fully understand and can apply the correct operation (multiplication) along with correctly handling mixed fractions.

Given the struggles evident across these attempts, and considering typical classroom performance distribution, I estimate that about 10% of the students would clearly understand and apply the correct operation to score full marks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$
