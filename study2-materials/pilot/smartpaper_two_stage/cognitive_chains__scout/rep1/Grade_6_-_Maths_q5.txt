Based on the attempts I've reviewed, I'd estimate that around 10-15 students would get the correct sum and difference. 

Many students struggle with basic concepts, and some even with the English terminology. Looking at the diverse ways students have approached this question, I think a generous estimate of students who would score full marks is around 12.

Converting that to a percentage: (12 / 500) * 100 = 2.4%

So, I'd say: 2.4 

Rounded to the nearest whole number as you're only allowing a number between 0 & 100 and a specific percentage wasn't to evaluated so finally my evaluation should stay 2
