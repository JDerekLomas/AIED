Reasoning: 

Most students have attempted to solve the problem and a significant number have correctly calculated the mileage (11 km/liter) and some have even attempted to multiply it by 12 to get the total distance. However, only a handful of students have provided a completely correct answer, i.e., 132 km. 

Notable errors in the student attempts include:

* Calculation mistakes (e.g., 131 km instead of 132 km)
* Not following the correct order of operations
* Answering in meters (mistaking units)
* Failing to clearly write down the final answer

Many of my students struggle with basic arithmetic operations and with presenting their answers clearly. Some are also not familiar with the correct format of the solution.

In a typical class of 40-50 students, I would say around 5-6 students would be able to correctly solve this problem. Given this, I estimate around 15% of 500 students (75 students) would score full marks on this question.
