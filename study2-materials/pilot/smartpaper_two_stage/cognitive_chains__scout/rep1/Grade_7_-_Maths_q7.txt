Based on the attempts provided, I would estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Here's my reasoning:

* Most students ( Attempts 1, 3, and some parts of 2, 4, and 5) were able to calculate both values correctly: `1/2` of `3/4` is indeed `3/8`, and `2/5` of `2/3` is indeed `4/15`.
* However, a significant number of students struggled with comparing the fractions ( Attempts 2, 4, and 5). They either didn't know how to compare fractions or made incorrect comparisons based on the numerators or denominators alone.
* Only Attempt 1 and Attempt 3 showed a correct comparison using cross-multiplication.

Considering the distribution of ability in my classroom, I would estimate that:

* About 40-50 students would demonstrate a strong understanding of fractions, calculations, and comparisons (like Attempts 1 and 3).
* A larger group would show a partial understanding but make critical errors in comparison (like Attempts 2, 4, and 5).
* The remaining students would struggle with the calculations or not attempt the problem.

Hence, I estimate that 20% of my students (100 students out of 500) would score full marks on this question.
