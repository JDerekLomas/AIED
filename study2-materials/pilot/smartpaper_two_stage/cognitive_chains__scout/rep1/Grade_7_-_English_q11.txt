## Step 1: Analyzing Student Attempts
Analyzing the attempts provided, it's clear that students have varying levels of understanding regarding what constitutes an adjective phrase and how to identify adjectives within sentences. Student Attempt 1 correctly identifies "tiny" as an adjective. Student Attempt 2 incorrectly refers to "big" but does mention "tiny is the adjective." Attempts 3, 4, and 5 show confusion about what an adjective phrase is and how to identify it, with some mentioning the correct part of the sentence but not applying the correct terminology or concept.

## 2: Evaluating Understanding of Adjective Phrases
The question asks specifically for the identification of the adjective phrase, which in the given sentence is "in our balcony" or alternatively recognizing "tiny" as an adjective modifying the noun "bird." However, the focus seems to be on identifying "tiny" as an adjective for full marks. Students who can accurately pinpoint "tiny" as an adjective demonstrate a basic understanding of adjectives.

## 3: Assessing Common Errors and Understanding
Common errors include confusion about what constitutes an adjective phrase versus a single adjective, and difficulty in applying grammatical terms to sentence components. Given the attempts, a significant number of students seem to recognize "tiny" as a descriptor of "bird," but may struggle with the terminology or the concept of an adjective phrase.

## 4: Estimating Student Performance
Given 500 students and considering the distribution of ability in a typical Indian government school classroom, it's reasonable to assume that:
- A small fraction of students are advanced and would easily understand and correctly identify "tiny" as an adjective.
- A larger fraction might struggle with grammatical concepts but have a basic intuition about descriptive words.

## 5: Final Estimation
Based on the provided attempts and assuming a typical distribution of abilities, let's conservatively estimate. If only a few students show a clear understanding (like Student Attempt 1), and considering many struggle with basic concepts (as seen in Attempts 2-5), it's likely that around 20-30% of students might accurately identify "tiny" as an adjective without much confusion, given the emphasis on this specific skill.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$
