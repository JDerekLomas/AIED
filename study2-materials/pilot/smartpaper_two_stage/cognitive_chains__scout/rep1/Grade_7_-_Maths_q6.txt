## Step 1: Analyzing Student Attempts
Looking at the attempts provided, it's clear that students have varying levels of understanding and application of converting mixed fractions to improper fractions and then multiplying them. Some students made errors in conversion, multiplication, or converting back to mixed fractions.

## 2: Identifying Correct Steps
To score full marks, a student must correctly convert both mixed fractions into improper fractions (1 1/2 to 3/2 and 3 1/4 to 13/4), multiply them correctly (3/2 * 13/4 = 39/8), and then express the answer as a mixed fraction (4 7/8).

## 3: Evaluating Attempts for Full Marks
- Student Attempt 1 correctly converts, multiplies, and then converts back to a mixed fraction but makes a calculation error in the division for the mixed fraction.
- Student Attempt 2 correctly converts but makes errors in multiplication and simplifying the mixed fraction.
- Student Attempt 3 makes a calculation error in multiplication.
- Student Attempt 4 correctly converts and multiplies but seems to struggle with expressing the result as a mixed fraction and makes a calculation error.
- Student Attempt 5 correctly converts, multiplies, and attempts to convert to a mixed fraction but doesn't simplify correctly.

## 4: Assessing Classroom Ability
Given the distribution of ability in the classroom, with many students struggling with English and mathematical concepts, it's reasonable to assume that only a small proportion would master all steps correctly without any errors.

## 5: Estimating Proportion for Full Marks
From the attempts shown, even those that are close seem to have significant errors. This suggests a lower success rate. In a class of 500, if we consider the variability and the errors observed, it's challenging for more than a fraction of students to get it entirely correct given the complexity and the errors demonstrated.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$
