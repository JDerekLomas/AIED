To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks on this question, I'll analyze the attempts provided and consider the common challenges students face in my experience.

## Step 1: Analyze the Attempts for Common Mistakes and Understanding
All the attempts demonstrate an understanding of applying the distributive property by taking out the common factor 9/16. However, there are variations in how students calculate the LCM and perform the arithmetic.

## 2: Identify Key Challenges
The main challenges in solving this problem seem to be:
1. Calculating the LCM of 12 and 9.
2. Finding equivalent fractions for 4/12 and 3/9 with the LCM as the denominator.
3. Performing the arithmetic to simplify the expression.

## 3: Assess Student Performance Based on Attempts
- **Student Attempt 1**: Correctly identifies the common factor, calculates the LCM, and simplifies but has a minor misstep in expressing fractions with the LCM.
- **Student Attempt 2**: Applies the distributive property correctly, finds the LCM, and then correctly calculates the final result.
- **Student Attempt 3**: Quickly and correctly applies the steps to reach the solution.
- **Student Attempt 4**: Shows a clear and mathematically accurate solution.
- **Student Attempt 5**: Similar to others, correctly applies the property and calculates the result.

## 4: Consider Classroom Ability Distribution
Given the mix of abilities in a typical classroom, where many students may struggle with fractions and LCM calculations, a significant portion might not reach the correct answer due to arithmetic mistakes or failing to apply the distributive property correctly.

## 5: Estimate of Full Marks
From the provided attempts, it's clear that a well-structured approach and basic arithmetic can lead to the correct answer. Assuming a normal distribution of ability and based on my experience with 500 Class 8 students, where fractions and LCM can be challenging topics, especially in English, I'd anticipate a range of performances.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$
