Rationale: 

The attempts provided demonstrate varying degrees of understanding of the impact of wars on the economic life of kingdoms. Attempts 1-5 show some level of awareness of the negative economic consequences of war, such as depletion of treasury, increased taxes, destruction of crops, and poverty. However, to score full marks, students need to provide a clear and distinct economic impact.

Upon analyzing the attempts, I notice that:

* Attempts 1, 2, 3, and 5 mention the depletion of treasury or empty treasury, which can be considered a clear economic impact.
* Attempt 4 mentions multiple impacts, including destruction of crops, increased taxes, and no business happening, demonstrating a more comprehensive understanding.

Assuming a normal distribution of abilities in my classroom, I estimate that:

* About 40% of students may not clearly articulate any economic impact ( mainly struggling with language).
* Around 30-40% may provide some ideas, but not clearly and distinctly stated.
* A smaller proportion (around 20%) may clearly identify one distinct and plausible economic impact, such as depletion of treasury or destruction of crops.

Hence, I estimate that 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.
