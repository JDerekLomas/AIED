Rationale: 

Based on the attempts provided, it seems that many students have a basic understanding that "fast" and "slow" are opposites, but their ability to express this understanding in writing is limited. 

Attempts 1 and 2 show some understanding of opposites but struggle to formulate a clear answer. Attempts 3 and 5 indicate confusion with homophones ("past" and "fast") or incorrect spellings, and Attempt 4 provides a clear but unprompted answer.

Given the literacy challenges evident in these samples and my experience teaching this age group, I estimate that approximately 10% of 500 students (i.e., 50 students) would be able to write the correct answer "fast" and score full marks.
