Rationale:

* Most students have a basic understanding of multiplication, but struggle with applying the sign rule, as evident from Attempts 1, 3, and 5.
* Some students can recall the rule "minus minus is plus" but may not apply it correctly, as in Attempts 2 and 4.
* Only a few students would be able to clearly articulate both the multiplication fact (3*4=12) and the sign rule (negative*negative=positive) to arrive at the correct answer, 12.
* Considering the distribution of abilities in a typical Indian government school, I estimate around 15% of students would be able to score full marks on this question.
