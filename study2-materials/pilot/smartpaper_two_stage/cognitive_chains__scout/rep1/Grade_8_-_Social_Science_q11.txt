5

To arrive at this estimate, I considered the attempts provided and my experience with the students' abilities. Most students demonstrated an understanding of the general impact of British rule on tribal lives, such as the loss of land and forests, economic exploitation, and disruption of their traditional way of life. However, not all attempts were clear, concise, or accurate.

The attempts revealed common issues:

* Grammatical errors and difficulties with English expression
* Limited vocabulary and simplistic sentence structures
* Some attempts focused on narratives (e.g., Birsa Munda's story) rather than providing a clear explanation of the general impact
* A few students failed to provide two distinct examples

Considering these challenges, I estimate that only a small percentage of students would score full marks. About 5% of my students typically demonstrate advanced writing skills, clear thinking, and the ability to express themselves effectively in English. These students would likely provide well-structured answers that address the general impact of British rule on tribal lives and offer two distinct, relevant examples.

Keep in mind that these estimates are based on my experience with government school students, where English proficiency and writing skills can vary significantly. Given the abilities I've observed, I believe 5% is a reasonable estimate of students who would score full marks on this question.
