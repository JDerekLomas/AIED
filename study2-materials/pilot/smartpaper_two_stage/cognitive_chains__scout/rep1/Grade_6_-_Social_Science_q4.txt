Based on the student attempts provided, I would estimate that around 5-7 students out of 500 would score full marks on this question, which translates to 1-1.4%. 

This is because only a few students have attempted to write coherent and somewhat accurate descriptions of the Thar Desert, and most of them still have significant grammatical errors and lack of vocabulary. Even in the provided examples, none of the students have scored full marks as they have not used precise language and have several errors.

Considering the English language challenges my students face, I would say the average to above-average students might have fared somewhat better. However, very few would meet the full criteria. Therefore, my estimate of students scoring full marks would be:

1%
