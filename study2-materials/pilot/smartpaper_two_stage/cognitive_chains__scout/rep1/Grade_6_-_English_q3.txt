20

Here's my reasoning:

After reviewing the attempts, I notice that many students struggle with basic grammar, verb tense, and sentence structure. Only none of the attempts provided accurately states that "Riya loved to read books in the evening". However, a few attempts show some understanding of the context.

Attempts 2, 3, and 5 show a partial understanding, but are marred by grammatical errors. Attempts 1 and 4 are more problematic.

Given my experience with the variability in English language proficiency in my classroom, I estimate that only a small fraction of my 500 students would be able to clearly and correctly state that Riya loved to read books in the evening. About 1 in 5 students would likely get it right, hence 20%.
