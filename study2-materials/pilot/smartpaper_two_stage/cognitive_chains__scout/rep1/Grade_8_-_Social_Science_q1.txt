15

Rationale:
Based on the attempts provided, it appears that many students have a basic understanding of Fundamental Rights, but their expression and accuracy are limited. Some students listed only two rights, and while they were not always precise (e.g., "Right to fredom" instead of "Right to Freedom"), they showed some understanding. However, many attempts combined incorrect or incomplete information with a meta-comment about there being six rights, suggesting that students may have been trying to recall a list rather than demonstrate secure understanding.

In a class of 500, I would estimate that around 15% of students would be able to clearly and accurately name two distinct Fundamental Rights. This reflects the typical distribution of abilities in my classroom, with some students able to articulate their knowledge confidently and accurately, while others may struggle with basic concepts or language.

In general, I find that:

* Around 10-15% of students demonstrate advanced understanding and can express themselves clearly and accurately.
* A further 20-30% show a good grasp of concepts, but may make some errors or struggle with language.
* The remaining 55-65% may have some difficulties, whether due to language barriers, limited understanding, or careless mistakes.

Therefore, a conservative estimate of 15% scoring full marks seems reasonable.
