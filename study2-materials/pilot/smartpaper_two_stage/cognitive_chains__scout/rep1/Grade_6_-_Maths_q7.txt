15

I have considered all the attempts provided and taking in mind my experience with 500 students of class 6.

Most of students attempted this question but had errors in determining time elapsed from 10 am to 4 pm, with many counting incorrectly. 

Out of these, more than half had a accurate method (i.e., counting 6 hours from given time), the rest overcounted or produced list as done previously but did. Most have a very little knowledge about temperature also, thus very minimal conceptual idea.

But here my estimated answer give the mark as , 15% students would full mark i,e; have a appropriate idea & calculation
