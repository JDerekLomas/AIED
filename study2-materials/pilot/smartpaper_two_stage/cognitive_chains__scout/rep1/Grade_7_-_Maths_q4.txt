Based on the attempts provided, I estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The attempts show a range of understanding, from not knowing how to handle decimal division at all ( Attempts 2 and 5) to having a good understanding of converting decimals to fractions to facilitate division (Attempts 1, 3, and 5). However, even among the students who showed a good understanding, there were small errors or uncertainties (e.g., Attempt 1: incorrect calculation, Attempt 3: incorrect answer, Attempt 5: uncertain conclusion).

In a typical Indian government school classroom, I would expect a significant proportion of students to struggle with mathematical concepts, particularly those that require a good understanding of English and mathematical notation. Given this, I estimate that only about 20% of students would be able to set up the division correctly and obtain the full marks.
