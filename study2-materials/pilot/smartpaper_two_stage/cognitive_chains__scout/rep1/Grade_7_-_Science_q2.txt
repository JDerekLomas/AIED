I have considered all the student attempts and the common errors they made. Many students were able to name the process as "conduction" but had difficulty in explaining how the heat travels. Some used simple sentences and basic vocabulary, while others tried to provide more scientific explanations. However, most of them lacked clarity and accuracy in their responses.

Based on my experience, I can gauge that around 20% of my students would be able to provide a clear, concise, and scientifically accurate response, scoring full marks. This would include students who have a good grasp of the English language and a solid understanding of the concept of conduction. Additionally, a small proportion of students might also have the ability to articulate their thoughts clearly, which would contribute to their full marks. 

However, considering that around 30-40 students might get part marks for (a) and some for (b), to actually getting a full percentage as this question weighs, I'd stick with 20% , taking general performance in my class into account as well. .
