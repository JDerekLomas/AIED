17

I estimate that about 17% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. This is based on the attempts provided, which show a mix of understanding and misunderstandings. Some students have a clear idea of the concept (malleability) but struggle with spelling and grammar, while others seem to have a vague idea but don't articulate it correctly.

In my experience, a significant number of students, likely around 30-40%, would be able to recall the correct term "malleability" with some prompting or if they had studied the concept recently. However, when it comes to writing it down correctly in English, without any errors, I estimate that only about 17% would be able to do so.

This estimate takes into account the distribution of ability in my classroom, where many students struggle with English, some are competent, and few are advanced. The attempts provided suggest that some students are able to convey their understanding in their own words, but may not have the linguistic skills to express it accurately.
