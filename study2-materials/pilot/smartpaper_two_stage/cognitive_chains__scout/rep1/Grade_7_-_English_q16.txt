12 

I have considered all 5 attempts in relation to the class I teach. Few students even attempted sentences that are understandable. While Attempts 1-4 leave much to be desired (grammatical errors or overly simplistic) Attempt 5 demonstrates an acceptable and clear message within the rubric's requirements — and only a handful are even close to producing something similar with correct basic grammar and required information (missing grandmother, want her to visit soon) out of my 500. So I estimate around 12% getting it right as a best-case scenario after evaluating efforts put forth.
