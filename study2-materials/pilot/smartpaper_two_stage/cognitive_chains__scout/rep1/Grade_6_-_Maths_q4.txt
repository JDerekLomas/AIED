## Step 1: Reviewing the Attempts
Reviewing the attempts provided, it's clear that all students have attempted to find the LCM using the division method. Most have correctly identified the prime factors and calculated the LCM as 60, but due to miscalculation or incorrect multiplication, they arrive at 50 instead of 60.

## 2: Identifying Common Mistakes
The common mistake among the students who provided attempts is the incorrect final calculation: 2 x 2 x 3 x 5 = 60, not 50. This indicates a lack of basic multiplication fact recall or a simple arithmetic error.

## 3: Assessing Understanding of LCM Concept
Despite the arithmetic errors, all the attempts demonstrate an understanding of the method for finding the LCM, which is a crucial concept. This suggests that a significant portion of the students have been exposed to and understand the process.

## 4: Considering Classroom Distribution
In a typical Indian government school classroom, there is a wide range of abilities. Many students struggle with basic concepts, some grasp them with effort, and a few excel. English proficiency can also affect performance, especially in understanding and writing mathematical terms.

## 5: Estimating Full Marks
Given that all the provided attempts show an understanding of the LCM method but err in calculation, and considering the distribution of abilities in a classroom of 500 students, it's reasonable to assume that only a small fraction would accurately calculate the LCM without error. This fraction would likely include students who are not only familiar with the method but also have strong arithmetic skills.

## 6: Final Estimation
Based on experience and the attempts provided, it seems that around 20-30% of students might demonstrate a correct method. However, achieving full marks requires both a correct method and accurate calculation. Given the prevalence of calculation errors in the attempts shown, I estimate that about 10-20% might actually score full marks, considering both the understanding of the concept and the accuracy in calculation. A conservative estimate, taking into account the struggles with basic arithmetic and potential language barriers, would be on the lower side.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$
