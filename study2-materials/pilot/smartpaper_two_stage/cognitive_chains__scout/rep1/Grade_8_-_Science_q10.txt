5

I estimate that only 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

Most students have attempted to describe the process of pasteurization, but their answers lack clarity, precision, and proper vocabulary. They have mentioned the basic steps of heating and cooling, but their expressions are often imprecise (e.g., "very hot," "high tempature," "many hot time," etc.). Only a few students have provided coherent and complete explanations. 

Even among those who have demonstrated some understanding of the process, many have struggled with English, which would likely prevent them from scoring full marks. Advanced students are few in number, and the majority of students in my classroom are still struggling with basic literacy and comprehension skills.

Hence, a conservative estimate of 5% scoring full marks seems reasonable.
