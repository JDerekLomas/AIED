I have considered the attempts provided and reflected on my experience of marking papers from 500 Class 6 students. The attempts show that most students are able to identify a line from the poem they like, but struggle to provide a coherent and relevant reason. To score full marks, students need to denote a line from the poem and provide a clear explanation of why they like it.

Given the distribution of ability in my classroom, I expect a small proportion of students to score full marks. Based on the attempts provided, it seems that only a few students are able to clearly articulate their thoughts and follow the rubric. Therefore, I estimate that 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.
