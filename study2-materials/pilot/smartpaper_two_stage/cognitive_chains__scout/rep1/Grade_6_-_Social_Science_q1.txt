Rationale:

* Most students have attempted to name two mountain ranges, indicating they have some understanding of the concept.
* However, the spelling errors (e.g., "Himayala" instead of "Himalayas", "Vinday" instead of "Vindhya") and grammatical errors (e.g., "montain" instead of "mountain") suggest that many students struggle with English.
* Some students have listed one correct and one incorrect range (e.g., Student Attempt 3), while others have listed two, but with errors (e.g., Student Attempt 1).
* Only a few students have demonstrated a clear understanding of the question and can provide correct answers with proper spelling (e.g., Student Attempt 5).

Based on my experience, I'd estimate that around 20% of the students would score full marks, as they have a good command of English and geographical concepts. The rest would either have partial marks or zero marks due to errors in spelling, grammar, or incomplete answers.
