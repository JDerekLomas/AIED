Reasoning: 
While most students have attempted to answer that the goldsmith uses the outer zone of the flame and have also stated its color as blue, some critical errors are noticeable. Common mistakes include grammatical errors, spelling errors, and not specifically mentioning that it's the "outermost" or "non-luminous" zone. Also, some students wrote "mombatti" instead of "candle" and metal names were not correctly written. Phrases such as "very hotest" are also not grammatically correct. Given the mass of students in government schools struggling with both language and fundamental concepts, I estimate that only a few would precisely mention the outer zone, reason, and potentially get full marks, which I estimate around 10%.
