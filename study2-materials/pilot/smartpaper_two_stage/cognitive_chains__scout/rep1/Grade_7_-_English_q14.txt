Based on the student attempts provided, I estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Here's my reasoning:

* Attempts 1 and 2 demonstrate a basic understanding of the concept of antonyms, but the students seem to be struggling with vocabulary and spelling ("modarn" instead of "modern").
* Attempts 3 and 5 show a better understanding of the concept, with the students correctly identifying "modern" or "new" as the antonym, but they may not have written it clearly or accurately.
* Attempt 4 simply reiterates the word "old" which is a synonym of "ancient", not an antonym, indicating a lack of understanding.

Given that my classroom has a typical distribution of abilities, I estimate that only a small proportion of students would be able to clearly and accurately write "modern" or "new" as the antonym for "ancient". Considering the struggles evident in the sample attempts, I would estimate around 20% of students would score full marks.
