Based on the attempts provided and my experience with teaching Class 8 students in an Indian government school, I estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The reasoning behind this estimate is as follows:

* Attempts 1 and 2 demonstrate a clear understanding of the concept of cross-multiplication and algebraic manipulation, with minor errors in calculation. About 10-15% of students might perform similarly well.
* Attempts 3 and 5 show a good understanding of cross-multiplication and algebraic manipulation but make careless mistakes, such as calculation errors. This might account for another 5-10% of students.
* Attempt 4 indicates a complete breakdown of algebraic manipulation, suggesting that the student struggles with basic concepts. Given the distribution of abilities in my classroom, I expect a significant proportion of students to struggle with this question.

Considering these factors, I estimate that approximately 20% of my students would execute the steps correctly, with no errors, to score full marks on this question.
