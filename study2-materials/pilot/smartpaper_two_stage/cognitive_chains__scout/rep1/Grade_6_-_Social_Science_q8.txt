15

I estimate that about 15% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

Here's my reasoning:

* Most students have attempted to name two child rights, which shows some understanding of the concept. However, only a few students have expressed themselves clearly and accurately in English.
* Few students have provided a clear explanation of the importance of one of the rights, but among those who have, the answers are often simplistic or inaccurate.
* Some students seem to have memorized certain phrases, like "Right to Education" and "Right against Child Labour", but many haven't demonstrated a deeper understanding of the concepts.
* A larger number of students made small errors, like misspelling "education" as "educashun" or "impotence" instead of "importance".

Overall, I'm of the opinion that only a relatively small proportion of my students have been able to produce a well-written and substantially correct answer, meriting a full score of 1.
