The experience of marking papers!

After analyzing the attempts, I can see that even though most students got the correct answer (x = 3) - which was coincidental due to the numbers being low and 'working out' for them due to a wrong rule- 

Only a handful wrote a detailed process but did manage it , so lets account around 15 percent who seem reasonably through in getting  right even if procedurally slight wording . And rest lack English  or grasp.
