Based on my experience and the attempts provided, I would estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The attempts show a range of understanding, from some students correctly identifying the place value of 5 as 500 (Attempt 2) or showing a correct thought process (Attempt 4), to many getting it incorrect or using unconventional reasoning (Attempts 1, 3, and 5). Considering the diversity of abilities in my classroom, with many students struggling with English and place value concepts, I believe 20% would be a reasonable estimate of students who could accurately answer this question and score full marks. 

Percentage scoring full marks: 20
