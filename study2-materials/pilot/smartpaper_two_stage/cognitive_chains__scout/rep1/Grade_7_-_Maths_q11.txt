## Step 1: Reviewing the Attempts
To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks, let's first review the attempts provided. There are 5 attempts, each showing a different student's understanding and execution of the task.

## 2: Understanding the Requirements
The task requires two parts: (a) creating a bar graph with appropriate scaling and labeling, and (b) identifying the classes with the maximum and minimum number of children.

## 3: Evaluating Attempt 1
Student Attempt 1 shows a basic understanding but lacks detail in the graph description. The scale is chosen (1 big box = 10 children), but the description of drawing lines for classes is vague. The answer to part (b) is mostly correct.

## 4: Evaluating Attempt 2
Student Attempt 2 shows a rough bar graph with some inaccuracies in scaling and representation. The student attempts to label axes but makes errors in graph construction.

## 5: Evaluating Attempt 3
Student Attempt 3 chooses an inappropriate scale (1 unit = 1 student) and has very tall thin lines, indicating a misunderstanding of graphing.

## 6: Evaluating Attempt 4
Student Attempt 4 shows a good understanding of graph construction, choosing a scale (1 unit = 50 children), but mentions the line is a bit bent due to the lack of a ruler.

## 7: Evaluating Attempt 5
Student Attempt 5 attempts to draw a box for the graph but seems incomplete. The scale chosen (1 cm = 1 child) might not be practical for this data.

## 8: Assessing Understanding and Competence
Given the variability in attempts, it's clear that many students struggle with creating appropriate graphs and choosing scales. Few attempts show a clear, correct understanding of graphing and scaling.

## 9: Estimating Full Marks
Assuming a normal distribution of ability in the classroom, with many struggling, some competent, and few advanced, let's consider the following:
- Only a couple of attempts show some degree of correctness and understanding.
- Most attempts have significant errors in either graphing, scaling, or both.

## 10: Conclusion
Given the struggles evident in the attempts and assuming a typical distribution of abilities in a classroom, I estimate that less than 10% of the students would have the skills and understanding to score full marks on this question. This is because creating a correct bar graph with appropriate scaling and labeling, as well as accurately answering the question about maximum and minimum class sizes, requires a level of competency that not many students seem to have demonstrated.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
