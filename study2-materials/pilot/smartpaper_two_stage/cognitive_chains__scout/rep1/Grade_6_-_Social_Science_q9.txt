I consider that only a very small proportion of my students have demonstrated an understanding of the question, and even fewer have been able to express it clearly. 

Most students have been able to name one monument and provide some context, but only a few attempts showed a good understanding of the question and proper expression. However given such basic nature of question and typical response of very poor english , it would not be more than 5% who can attempt to answer it correctly as per marksheet which i recently concluded 

Therefore I assess that only about 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.
