Based on the attempts provided, it seems that a significant number of students are able to understand the basic concept of dividing the chocolates among the students, but struggle with the nuances of rounding up to the next multiple and applying it to the class level.

Attempts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 demonstrate varying degrees of understanding, but only a few students seem to have correctly calculated the minimum number of chocolates required (320) and the number of chocolates per class (37 or 37.5).

Assuming a normal distribution of ability in my classroom, I would estimate that only a small proportion of students would score full marks. Considering the struggles evident in the attempts provided, I estimate that around 20-25 students out of 500 would score full marks.

This represents about 4-5% of the total students.

Percentage scoring full marks: 5
