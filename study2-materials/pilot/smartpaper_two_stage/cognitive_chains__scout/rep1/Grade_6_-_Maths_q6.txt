Based on the attempts provided and my experience teaching Class 6 students in an Indian government school, I estimate that around 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Most students have made errors in calculating the area of the rectangle, adding the length and width instead of multiplying them. This suggests a lack of understanding of the concept of area and/or difficulty with English comprehension. Advanced students who are competent in both math and English are likely to be a small proportion of the class.

Therefore, I estimate that only 5% of my students, or 25 students out of 500, would be able to correctly calculate the areas of both the rectangle and square and score full marks. 

Percentage scoring full marks: 5
