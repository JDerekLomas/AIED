## Step 1: Analyze the problem and the rubric for scoring full marks.
The problem requires finding the maximum value of a weight that can measure the weight of two bags of fertiliser, with weights of 75 kg and 69 kg, an exact number of times. This translates to finding the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of 75 and 69. To score full marks (0.5), a student must correctly identify that the problem requires finding the HCF of 75 and 69.

## 2: Evaluate each student attempt based on the rubric.
- Student Attempt 1: Incorrectly states that for the maximum weight, they have to do HCF, and then correctly finds the HCF as 3 kg.
- Student Attempt 2: Incorrectly adds the weights first but then correctly finds the HCF as 3 kg.
- Student Attempt 3: Correctly identifies the need for HCF and finds it as 3 kg.
- Student Attempt 4: Incorrectly starts with LCM but then correctly finds the HCF as 3 kg.
- Student Attempt 5: Starts with an incorrect approach (adding weights) but then correctly finds the HCF as 3 kg.

## 3: Determine the common errors and successes across attempts.
Most students eventually arrive at the correct answer of 3 kg, but some start with incorrect methods (like addition or mentioning LCM). The key is identifying who correctly understands the need for HCF.

## 4: Estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks based on typical classroom performance.
Given 500 students and a typical distribution of abilities:
- A small fraction are advanced and understand concepts quickly.
- Many are competent but might struggle with abstract concepts or wordings.
- Some struggle significantly, especially with English and abstract mathematical concepts.

## 5: Consider the specific challenges of this problem.
The problem requires understanding of mathematical vocabulary (e.g., "maximum value of a weight") and the concept of HCF. Many students may struggle to articulate or apply these concepts correctly.

## 6: Make an educated guess on the percentage scoring full marks.
Given the attempts provided, it seems a significant number of students can find the HCF correctly but might struggle with the initial understanding or explanation. Assuming a fairly standard distribution of abilities and challenges with mathematical vocabulary and concepts, I estimate around 20% of students would clearly and correctly identify the need for HCF and calculate it correctly without confusion.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$
