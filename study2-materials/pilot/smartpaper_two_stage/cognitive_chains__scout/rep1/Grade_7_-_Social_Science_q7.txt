5

I estimate that only 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. The attempts provided demonstrate a range of understanding, but most students struggle with clear explanations, grammar, and vocabulary. Even the better attempts (e.g., Student Attempt 2) lack specific details and clarity in their explanations.

Considering the distribution of ability in my classroom, I would expect only a few students to provide a well-structured and clear response that fully addresses the question and scores maximum marks. Many students may identify some roles of money or benefits of digital money, but their explanations would likely be incomplete, simplistic, or plagued by grammatical errors, which would prevent them from scoring full marks.
