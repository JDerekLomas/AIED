Based on the student attempts provided, I would estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The attempts show that many students have a basic understanding of the concept that cows have a different digestive system because they eat grass, and that humans don't. However, most attempts lack clarity, precision, and proper scientific vocabulary. Only a few attempts come close to articulating the key difference related to their diet and the special features of the ruminant digestive system.

Considering the language barriers and the varying levels of scientific understanding in my classroom, I think 20% is a reasonable estimate of students who could provide a clear and accurate response that would score full marks.
