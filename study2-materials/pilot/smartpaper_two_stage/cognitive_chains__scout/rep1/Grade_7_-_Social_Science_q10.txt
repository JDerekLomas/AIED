Based on the attempts provided, I would estimate that around 5-7 students out of 500 would score full marks on this question. This translates to approximately 1-1.4% of the total students.

The reasons for this low estimate are:

1. Many students struggle with English language and grammar, evident from spelling mistakes, incorrect sentence structures, and limited vocabulary.
2. While some students have a basic understanding of Ashoka's reign, they often fail to clearly articulate the significance of his rule and its impact on Indian history.
3. The attempts demonstrate a lack of clarity and coherence in expressing ideas, making it difficult for students to achieve full marks.

Considering the distribution of ability in my classroom, I would categorize the students as follows:

* Struggling students (70-80%): Those who have difficulty expressing their ideas in English and lack a clear understanding of the topic.
* Competent students (20-25%): Those who have a basic understanding of Ashoka's reign but may not be able to articulate its significance effectively.
* Advanced students (5-10%): Those who demonstrate a clear understanding of the topic and can express their ideas coherently, but may still lack the nuance and depth required for full marks.

Based on these factors, I estimate that only a small percentage of students would be able to achieve full marks on this question. 

Percentage scoring full marks: 1.2%
