Rationale: Based on the student attempts provided, it appears that many students have a basic understanding of the concepts of archaeological and literary sources. However, their definitions and examples are often incomplete, inaccurate, or lack clarity. 

Attempts 1-5 demonstrate a mix of understanding and mis理解, with some students confusing the concepts or providing incomplete definitions. For instance, most attempts define archaeological sources as "old things found under the ground" but fail to provide a clear, comprehensive definition that includes physical remains/material evidence.

Given that these attempts are representative of the range of abilities in the class, I estimate that only about 20% of the 500 students would be able to provide a clear, accurate definition of both archaeological and literary sources, along with a correct example for each, scoring full marks. This estimate takes into account the English language proficiency issues, common misconceptions, and the variability in the quality of responses.
