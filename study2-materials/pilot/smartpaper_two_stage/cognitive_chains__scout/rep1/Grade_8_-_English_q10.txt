Reasoning: Based on my experience, it seems that most students are struggling with the correct usage of "too...to". Attempts 1-5 show a common mistake of incorrect spelling of "too" as "to". This suggests that a significant number of students are not familiar with the correct spelling and usage of "too". 

Also, only one student (none in the given examples) got it right, implying that a small fraction of students are confident with the construction. Given that a typical classroom distribution of abilities shows a larger proportion of students at the lower end of achievement and very few at the advanced level, I would estimate around 20% of students would score full marks on this question.
