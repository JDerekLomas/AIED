Reasoning: 

The question requires an understanding of Active and Passive Voice, which can be tricky for many students, especially in a government school where English might not be their primary language. Looking at the attempts provided:

- Attempts 1, 2, and 5 indicate a basic understanding that "blew" needs to change but do not correctly use the passive voice structure or incorrectly use "was" with "blew" instead of "blown".
- Attempt 3 shows an almost correct transformation but misses the article "the" before "wind".
- Attempt 4 correctly transforms the sentence into passive voice.

Given these patterns and my experience with teaching, I'd estimate:

- A small proportion of students (likely those who are advanced or have a good grasp of English grammar) would correctly answer it, as shown by Attempt 4.
- Many would struggle with verb forms, subject-verb agreement, and preposition usage.
- The majority of students, around 60-70%, would likely make errors similar to Attempts 1, 2, 3, and 5.

Therefore, considering the overall performance, ability levels, and common grammatical mistakes I've observed over the years, I estimate that about 20% of the students would score full marks on this question.
