Rationale: 

Most students have attempted to paraphrase the question rather than answering why the king announced a reward. A correct answer would reflect that the king announced a reward to encourage people to come forward with the answers to his questions.

From the given attempts:

- Only none of the student's attempts provides a complete, accurate reason in proper English. 
- 2 out of 5 attempts are somewhat on the right track (Student Attempt 2 and Student Attempt 5). 
However, due to issues with grammar and vocabulary, it's challenging to assign full marks.

Considering my experience with 500 Class 7 students and knowing the issues with English proficiency and understanding, a reasonable estimate of students who could provide an accurate and well-phrased answer (like "The king announced a reward to find someone who could answer his three questions.") is around 15%. This is accounting for a few very competent students and an estimate of students who can grasp this question.
