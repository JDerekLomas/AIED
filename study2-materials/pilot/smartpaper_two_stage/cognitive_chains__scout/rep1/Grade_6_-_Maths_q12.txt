Based on the attempts provided, I would estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Here's my reasoning:

* Attempts 1, 2, 4, and 5 demonstrate a good understanding of division, remainder, and the question's requirements. They correctly state that each box would have 11 pencils and that 8 more pencils are needed to make the number equal. These students have shown a clear understanding of the concept.
* Attempt 3, however, shows a lack of understanding of the division process and the concept of remainder. The student incorrectly concludes that each box would have 10 pencils and doesn't address the question's requirements.
* Given the distribution of ability in my classroom, I would estimate that about 20% of my students would perform like Attempts 1, 2, 4, and 5, while the majority would struggle or make errors like Attempt 3.

So, the percentage scoring full marks is: 20.
