12

Rationale: 

Based on the attempts provided, it's clear that many students struggle with finding factors, and some basic errors were made (e.g., confusing multiplication facts, misinterpreting the definition of a factor). Attempts 1-5 illustrate a mix of incorrect and partially correct responses. Only Attempts 2 and 3 come close to the correct answer, but both still contain superfluous or incorrectly assessed factors. A few students seemed to get partial credit (e.g., identifying 1, 2, 4 as factors), but complete accuracy was rare.

In my experience with 500 Class 6 students, I have noticed a bell-curve distribution of abilities: a small number of students are naturally advanced or have received extra support; the majority fall in the middle range with varying degrees of competence; and a significant number struggle with fundamental concepts.

Given the challenges evident in the provided attempts, I estimate about 12% of my students would accurately list all the factors of 68 without error.
