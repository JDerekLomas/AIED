5 

I arrive at this estimate by analyzing the attempts provided. Even the better attempts (e.g., Student Attempts 2 and 4) lack coherence, grammatical accuracy, and fluency. Most attempts have issues with spelling, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

Considering the struggles evident in these examples, and my experience with the English proficiency levels of Class 6 students in our school, I estimate that only a very small proportion of students would be able to write a paragraph that meets the requirements and scores full marks. It is likely that only the most advanced students, perhaps 1 in 20 or less, would have the necessary language skills to produce a well-structured paragraph. Therefore, I give a conservative estimate of 5%.
