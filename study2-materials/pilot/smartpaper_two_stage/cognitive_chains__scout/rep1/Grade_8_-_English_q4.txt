Based on the attempts provided, it seems that a significant number of students have some idea of the word, but many have varying degrees of spelling and understanding.

Considering my experience with 500 Class 8 students, I would estimate that about 15% of them would score full marks on this question. This is because:

* Only a few students (Attempts 2, 3, 4, and 5) came close to writing the correct word "breeze", although their spellings were incorrect or inconsistent ("breze", "BREZE", etc.).
* Many students seem to understand the meaning of the word, but their spellings and grammar are not accurate.
* Given the overall performance in English, I would expect around 10-20% of students to have a good grasp of vocabulary and spelling.

Therefore, my estimate is: **15**
