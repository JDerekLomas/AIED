Based on the attempts provided and my experience with Class 8 students in an Indian government school, I estimate that around 20 students out of 500 would score full marks on this question.

The attempts show a range of understanding, from Students 1 and 2 who made simple arithmetic mistakes, to Students 3 and 4 who demonstrated a good understanding of the expansion but made some errors, and Student 5 who got it almost correct but for a sign mistake. Given this distribution and assuming a normal distribution of ability in my classroom, I estimate that about 4% of students would score full marks.

Percentage scoring full marks: 4
