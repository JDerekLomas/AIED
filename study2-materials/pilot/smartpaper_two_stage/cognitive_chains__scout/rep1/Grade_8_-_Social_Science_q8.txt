Rationale: 

Most students have attempted to answer the question, but their responses indicate a limited understanding of the key features of the Indian Constitution. Many have mentioned basic points such as B.R. Ambedkar being the 'father' of the Constitution, the existence of fundamental rights, and secularism. However, their responses are often plagued by poor grammar, spelling errors, and simplistic sentence structures.

Considering the language barriers and the ability distribution in my classroom, I estimate that about 15% of the students would be able to clearly articulate at least one correct feature of the Indian Constitution, such as "longest written constitution," "fundamental rights," or "secularism," and thus score full marks. This percentage reflects my experience with the varying levels of English proficiency and understanding of social science concepts among my students.
