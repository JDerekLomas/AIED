Rationale: Considering the attempts provided, only none of them fully articulate the scene with perfect grammar and vocabulary, but some do mention essential elements like bird sounds and sunset. However, only attempts 1 to 4 clearly indicate hearing the sound of birds, albeit with very basic language skills. Attempt 5 also mentions sounds but incorrectly adds "animals." Given that distribution of abilities in my classroom includes many who struggle with English, I'm guessing around 1 in 5 or 20% could sufficiently articulate the sounds of birds in this context to score full marks.
