This estimate is based on analyzing the provided student attempts, which demonstrate varying degrees of understanding. Attempts 1-5 show that some students can articulate the central idea of the poem, albeit with grammatical and vocabulary errors.

* Attempts 2, 4, and 5 seem to grasp the theme, but with some confusion in expression.
* Attempts 1 and 3 are somewhat vague or imprecise in conveying the central idea.

Given the distribution of ability in a typical Indian government school classroom, I estimate that:

* About 10-15% of students (advanced) would have a clear and precise understanding of the poem's theme.
* Around 30-40% (competent) would have a reasonable grasp but might struggle with expression.
* The remaining 50-60% (struggling) would likely find it difficult to articulate the central idea.

Assuming a somewhat generous assessment, I'd estimate around 25% of 500 students (125 students) would score full marks on this question.
