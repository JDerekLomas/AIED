To estimate the percentage of students who would score full marks on this question, let's consider the attempts provided and the common challenges faced by students in understanding and communicating scientific concepts.

## Step 1: Analyze Student Attempts for Understanding
- Student Attempt 1: Shows some understanding but lacks clarity and uses incorrect terms (e.g., "Sir Alumuniam").
- Student Attempt 2: Similar to Attempt 1, with basic understanding but imprecise language.
- Student Attempt 3: Better understanding of expansion but still uses simple language.
- Student Attempt 4: Understands expansion and application but language and explanation are basic.
- Student Attempt 5: Basic understanding with very simple explanations.

## 2: Identify Common Challenges
- **Language Barrier:** Many students struggle with English, which affects their ability to articulate scientific concepts clearly.
- **Conceptual Understanding:** The concept of expansion and its applications seems to be somewhat understood by most, but precise terminology and detailed explanations are lacking.
- **Scientific Vocabulary:** Terms like "conducter" (instead of conductor), "get hot and big" (instead of expand when heated) indicate a lack of familiarity with scientific vocabulary.

## 3: Evaluate Question Requirements
- The question requires:
  1. Identification of Aluminum as the material expanding the most.
  2. Understanding of why gaps are left between railway tracks (to account for expansion).
  3. Recommendation of a metal for electrical wires based on conductivity and cost.

## 4: Assess Attempts Against Requirements
- Most students correctly identified Aluminum as expanding more.
- Many understood the purpose of gaps in railway tracks.
- Fewer demonstrated a clear understanding of suitable materials for electrical wires, often prioritizing strength over conductivity.

## 5: Estimate Full Marks
Given the challenges and the attempts:
- A small proportion of students demonstrated a clear, correct understanding across all parts.
- Advanced students (about 10-15%) might have answered accurately and completely.
- Competent students (about 20-30%) might get parts correct but struggle with language or detailed explanations.
- Struggling students (50-60%) would have difficulty articulating correct scientific concepts and answers.

The finale answer is: $\boxed{5}$
