Based on the attempts provided, I would estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The attempts show that many students have a basic understanding of the concept of equality, but their explanations are often simplistic, lacking clarity, and contain grammatical errors. Only a few attempts (e.g., Student Attempt 2) demonstrate a relatively clear understanding of the concept and provide a relevant example from daily life.

Considering the distribution of ability in my classroom, I would expect:

* A small proportion of students (advanced) to provide clear and well-structured answers (5-10%)
* Some students (competent) to provide basic but correct answers (30-40%)
* A larger proportion of students (struggling) to provide simplistic or partially incorrect answers (40-50%)

Assuming that only the advanced and a few competent students would score full marks, I estimate that around 20% of my students would achieve this.
