My experience with marking papers tells me that capitalization and punctuation are areas where many students struggle. While some students have attempted to capitalize proper nouns (Riya, Meena, Sunday), few have got it completely right along with the punctuation. I estimate about 20% of my students would have paid close enough attention to detail to get it entirely correct, considering the competency levels in my classroom.
