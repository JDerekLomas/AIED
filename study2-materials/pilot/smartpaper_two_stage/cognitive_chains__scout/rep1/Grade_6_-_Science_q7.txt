## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Rubric
The question asks students to identify what is missing in Kartik's diet, given that it includes a lot of fruits and vegetables but no milk, and then to prepare a diet chart for growing children. The rubric specifies that for full marks, students must correctly identify "milk" (or dairy products/calcium) as the missing component.

## 2: Analyzing Student Attempts
Analyzing the attempts:
- Student Attempt 1 correctly identifies milk as missing and provides a diet chart but does not explicitly state calcium or dairy.
- Student Attempt 2 identifies milk as necessary for bone and teeth strength, mentioning protein and calcium are missing.
- Student Attempt 3 correctly identifies milk as missing and provides a diet chart.
- Student Attempt 4 identifies milk as necessary for calcium and energy.
- Student Attempt 5 mentions that Kartik's diet is missing calcium and protein, specifically highlighting milk.

## 3: Evaluating Understanding of Nutritional Needs
Most students demonstrate an understanding that milk is crucial for calcium and bone health. However, the question requires a specific format: identifying the missing component (milk or calcium/dairy) and a diet chart.

## 4: Assessing Language and Nutritional Knowledge
Given the English language proficiency and nutritional knowledge in an Indian government school, it's reasonable to assume variability in responses. Many students can articulate basic nutritional needs, but expressing them in English and structuring a diet chart appropriately might be challenging.

## 5: Estimating Full Marks
Based on the attempts provided, all students show some level of understanding. For full marks, students need to articulate the lack of milk (or calcium) clearly and provide an appropriate diet chart. Given common challenges in English proficiency and content knowledge, it's unlikely a significant majority will score full marks.

## 6: Considering Classroom Distribution
In a typical classroom distribution, about 10-20% might be considered advanced, 30-40% average, and the rest below average. Advanced students might easily score full marks, but for the entire class of 500, estimating around 20-30% who could potentially craft a clear, correct response in English and provide a coherent diet chart is optimistic.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$
