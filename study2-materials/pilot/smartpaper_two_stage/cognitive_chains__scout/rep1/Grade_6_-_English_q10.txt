I estimate this because most of my students have a basic grasp of English and can understand simple sentences, but only some have a good understanding of the nuances of "some" and "any". I've seen many students in the middle range who can get it right, but still a significant number struggling. These attempts show a good number getting it right, so I'm fairly optimistic. However full marks on just one question is usually a stretch, even for top scorers so I conservatively assume about three-quarters.
