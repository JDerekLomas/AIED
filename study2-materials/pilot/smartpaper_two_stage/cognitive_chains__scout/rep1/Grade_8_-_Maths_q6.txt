## Step 1: Reviewing the Attempts for Understanding
Reviewing the attempts from the students, it's clear that most of them understand the basic concept of multiplication ("thrice" meaning 3 times) and addition. However, the accuracy in calculations and correct application of concepts varies.

## 2: Identifying Common Errors
Common errors include inaccurate calculations (e.g., 12*3 = 34 instead of 36), misunderstanding the question (focusing on the difference immediately rather than after 5 years), and improper handling of the age increase over 5 years.

## 3: Evaluating Student Attempts
- Student Attempt 1: Incorrectly calculates the final age difference after 5 years (claims 24 years).
- Student Attempt 2, 3: Correctly calculate the current ages and apply the 5-year increase, correctly finding a 22-year difference.
- Student Attempt 4: Similar to Attempt 1, incorrectly concludes with 24 years.
- Student Attempt 5: Incorrect calculation of father's age (33 instead of 36) leads to a wrong difference (21 years).

## 4: Assessing Conceptual Understanding
Most students can express "thrice" as 3 times, but only a few consistently apply mathematical operations accurately throughout their solution.

## 5: Estimating Competence
Given 500 students and observing the provided attempts, it seems that only a handful can accurately calculate the father's current age as 36 and then correctly determine the age difference after 5 years.

## 6: Classroom Distribution Consideration
In an Indian government school, there's a wide range of abilities. Some students excel in math or have better support. A smaller fraction tends to perform exceptionally well, understanding and applying concepts without error.

## 7: Final Estimation
Given these observations and the errors observed, I would estimate that a very small percentage can accurately follow through with correct calculations for full marks, likely below 10% given the struggles seen.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$
