This estimate is based on the analysis of the provided student attempts, which show a range of understanding but generally lack clarity and precision in explaining how the Battle of Plassey contributed to the expansion of British power in India. Most attempts mention key elements such as the battle, the involvement of Robert Clive, Siraj-ud-Daula, and Mir Jafar, and the consequence of British gaining power and control. However, they often lack the clear articulation that the victory led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal by placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab, which seems to be a requirement for full marks.

Given the distribution of abilities in a typical classroom, where many students struggle with expressing their ideas clearly in English, a few are competent but might not fully grasp the nuances of historical events, and only a few are advanced and can articulate their understanding precisely, I estimate that only a small percentage would score full marks. 

Attempts 1 through 5 demonstrate a basic understanding but are marred by simplistic language, slight inaccuracies, or a lack of direct explanation of how Mir Jafar's installation as a puppet king directly resulted in British control over Bengal. This indicates that while many students have a foundational knowledge, their ability to express it in a manner that aligns with the rubric for full marks is limited. Hence, the low estimate of 5%.
