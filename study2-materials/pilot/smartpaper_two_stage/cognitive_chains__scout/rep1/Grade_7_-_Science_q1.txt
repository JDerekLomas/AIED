## Step 1: Understand the requirements for full marks
To score full marks, a student needs to correctly identify the type of thermometer a doctor would use to measure body temperature as a "clinical thermometer" and explain why it's preferred over a laboratory thermometer.

## 2: Analyze Student Attempt 1
Student Attempt 1 shows an understanding that a doctor uses a clinical thermometer for measuring body temperature, mentions it's good for fever, and explains the role of the kink in keeping the mercury level from falling. However, there are grammatical errors and the explanation could be clearer.

## 3: Analyze Student Attempt 2
Student Attempt 2 identifies the clinical thermometer and mentions its preference due to the kink. However, the explanation is brief and lacks clarity on why laboratory thermometers are not suitable.

## 4: Analyze Student Attempt 3
Student Attempt 3 directly states that doctors use clinical thermometers because laboratory thermometers' readings go down fast when taken out of the mouth. It correctly identifies the purpose of the kink.

## 5: Analyze Student Attempt 4
Student Attempt 4 is clear about doctors using clinical thermometers, explains why laboratory thermometers are not preferred for this use, and correctly mentions the kink's function.

## 6: Analyze Student Attempt 5
Student Attempt 5 clearly identifies the "clinical thermometer," mentions the kink, and explains its benefit, although there are minor spelling errors.

## 7: Assess the common weaknesses and strengths
Common weaknesses include spelling mistakes (e.g., "thermometre" instead of "thermometer"), grammatical errors, and occasionally, a lack of clear explanation. Strengths include the ability to identify the clinical thermometer and explain the purpose of the kink.

## 8: Consider the distribution of ability in the classroom
Given that many students struggle with English, some are competent, and few are advanced, it's reasonable to assume a wide range of performance. The attempts show that while some students can clearly articulate the correct answer with minor errors, others may struggle significantly.

## 9: Estimate the proportion scoring full marks
Based on the provided attempts and assuming they are representative of the range of abilities in the class, it seems that around 20-30% of students might be able to clearly and correctly state that a doctor would use a "clinical thermometer" and provide a coherent reason related to the kink and its purpose. However, achieving full marks requires not just the identification but also the clarity and correctness of the explanation, which might be challenging for many.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$
