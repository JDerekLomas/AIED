I estimate that only 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

Most students have attempted to answer the question and provided some relevant information, but none have provided a fully satisfactory answer. Many have language limitations that affect their ability to articulate their ideas clearly. Based on their responses, some common errors and misunderstandings include confusing manure and fertilizers, thinking fertilizers (or urea) contain "vitamins" or "power food", and expressing simplistic or unclear ideas.

Although there are a few exceptional students whose responses demonstrate partial understanding of the concepts, I wouldn't expect more than 5% of my students to articulate their ideas clearly and scientifically to score full marks.
