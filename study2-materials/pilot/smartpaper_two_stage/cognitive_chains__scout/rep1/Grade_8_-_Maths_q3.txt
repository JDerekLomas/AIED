15

I have given this mark to only those students who have accurately written down total number of balls (10) as well total number of black balls(4), And then correctly use these numbers to give 4/10.Not  4/6 , not 0.6 but only 4/10 

From these samples,it is clear , only 2 students ( Student 1, 2 and 3) out of 5 have attempted it, lets say fully And Student 4 and 5 have not.Student 4 wrote 10/4 and  student 5  gave 6/10. 

Looking at general patterns of all incompetence I am assuming, students not make silly mistakes like using 6 for favourable would less

so based on Students Attempt ,nearly 15% make these kind on mistakes lets say .Its government School So I assuming 15 make perfect Ans
