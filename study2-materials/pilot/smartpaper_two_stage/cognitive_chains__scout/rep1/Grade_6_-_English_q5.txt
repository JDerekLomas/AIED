Based on the attempts provided and my experience with the class, I estimate that around 20% of the students would score full marks on this question.

The attempts provided show a range of understanding, but most students are struggling to articulate their thoughts in grammatically correct English and to provide relevant phrases from the poem. Even the stronger attempts (e.g., Attempt 5) are not perfect, and many students are relying on simplistic statements (e.g., "friend is very important").

Given that the rubric allows for full marks if the overall theme is mentioned without explicitly mentioning evidence, I expect a relatively small proportion of students to achieve full marks, as this requires a good understanding of the poem and the ability to express it in a clear and concise manner.
