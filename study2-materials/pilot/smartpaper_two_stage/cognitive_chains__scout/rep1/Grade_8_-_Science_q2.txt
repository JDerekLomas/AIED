Based on the student attempts provided, I would estimate that around 10% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Here's my reasoning:

* Attempts 1-5 demonstrate varying degrees of understanding, but most students have some idea that a microorganism (or "small insect/bug") is involved in curd making.
* However, only Attempt 4 correctly identifies the microorganism (lactobasilus is close enough to Lactobacillus) and its category (bacteria).
* Attempts 1-3 show some understanding, but have significant errors in spelling, classification, or description.
* Attempt 5 is completely incorrect, with a made-up spelling and incorrect classification as a virus.

Given that my students' abilities are distributed across a range, with many struggling with English and scientific terminology, I expect a relatively small proportion to score full marks. The attempts suggest that around 1 in 10 students have a good enough grasp of the concept, vocabulary, and spelling to answer accurately.
