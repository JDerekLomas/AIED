I have just marked papers from 500 Class 7 students, and based on the examples provided, I estimate that only a small proportion of students would score full marks on this question. The correct sentence requires the use of "an" before "elephant", "a" before "tiger", and "the" before "zoo". 

Most of the students in my class struggle with English grammar, and as I can see from the attempts provided, even simple sentences can be challenging for them. Given that only one of the five attempts provided was correct, I estimate that around 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. This seems like a reasonable estimate considering the general level of English proficiency in my class.
