Rationale:
Most students have demonstrated an understanding of the experiment, mentioning the use of iodine/iodine solution and the color change. However, their descriptions lack clarity, precision, and completeness. Only a few students got the crucial details right (e.g., using iodine solution, observing a color change to blue-black). 

Considering the typical distribution of abilities in my classroom, I estimate that about 20% of students would provide a clear, accurate, and complete answer that scores full marks. This percentage takes into account students' struggles with English and their varying levels of scientific literacy.
