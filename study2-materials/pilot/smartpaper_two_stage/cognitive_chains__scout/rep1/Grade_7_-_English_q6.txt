20

Rationale: 

Many students have attempted to describe the poet's writing style, but only a few have managed to use a suitable and relevant word. Most students have used simple sentences and basic vocabulary to describe the style as 'easy', 'simple', or 'direct'. However, their answers lack precision and clarity.

Considering the distribution of ability in my classroom, I would estimate that about 20% of the students would score full marks on this question. These students would be able to provide a clear, concise, and accurate description of the poet's writing style, using a suitable word such as 'simple', 'direct', or 'informal'.

The attempts provided showcase typical errors such as:

* Basic vocabulary and grammar
* Lack of precision in describing the writing style
* Simple sentence structures

These attempts are representative of the majority of my students, who struggle with English. However, a small proportion of students, around 20%, would demonstrate a better understanding of the question and the rubric, and would score full marks.
