Based on the attempts I've reviewed, I'd estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Many students were able to calculate the total value of the coins correctly, but some struggled with simple arithmetic operations like converting paise to rupees or dividing by 5. A few students also made careless mistakes or had incorrect understandings of the units.

Given the distribution of ability in my classroom, I think 20% is a reasonable estimate of students who would be able to execute the calculations flawlessly and score full marks.
