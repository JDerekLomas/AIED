Based on the student attempts provided, it's clear that many students have difficulties with English comprehension, vocabulary, and scientific concepts. Let's analyze the attempts:

* Only one student (Attempt 5) showed a clear understanding of all three parts of the question, using correct vocabulary and scientific concepts.
* Most students (Attempts 1-4) demonstrated some understanding of the relationship between sunlight and plant growth but struggled with vocabulary, grammar, and explaining scientific concepts.
* Many students used simple sentences, incorrect vocabulary, and showed limited comprehension of the question.

Considering the distribution of abilities in my classroom, I estimate that only a small proportion of students would score full marks on this question.

Percentage scoring full marks: 5

This estimate is based on my experience that only a few students in a government school classroom would have the necessary language proficiency, scientific understanding, and critical thinking skills to answer all parts of the question correctly.
