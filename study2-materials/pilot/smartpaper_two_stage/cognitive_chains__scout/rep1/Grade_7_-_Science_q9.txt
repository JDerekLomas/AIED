To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks on this question, let's analyze the attempts provided and consider the common challenges students face in our classroom.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Rubric
The question asks about the special mode of nutrition for a pitcher plant, why it traps insects despite being able to perform photosynthesis, and for another example of such a plant. The rubric for full marks requires precise answers: (a) identifying the mode of nutrition as 'insectivorous', (b) explaining the need to trap insects due to a lack of certain nutrients like nitrogen, and (c) providing another example of an insectivorous plant.

## 2: Analyzing Student Attempts
- **Student Attempt 1**: Shows understanding but has spelling and grammatical errors. Key concepts are there but not perfectly articulated.
- **Student Attempt 2**: Good understanding with minor errors in spelling ("Insektivorus" and "Nitrugen").
- **Student Attempt 3**: Similar to others but with a mistake in the example ("venus fly flower").
- **Your Attempt (4)**: Simple and straightforward but with inaccuracies ("Sun plant").
- **Student Attempt 5**: Combines correct and incorrect information ("Sun plant. Venus fly.").

## 3: Identifying Common Challenges
Many students struggle with:
- English language (spelling, grammar)
- Scientific vocabulary (e.g., "insectivorous", "nitrogen")
- Providing precise examples

## 4: Assessing Understanding
Despite challenges, several students demonstrate an understanding of:
- The mode of nutrition (insectivorous/insect-eating)
- The reason for trapping insects (lack of nutrients like nitrogen in the soil)
- Examples of such plants (Venus flytrap)

## 5: Estimating Full Marks
Considering the entire class of 500 and typical distribution:
- A few students will have advanced understanding and articulate it well.
- Many will have a good understanding but struggle with expression.
- Some will struggle significantly.

## 6: Making the Estimate
Based on my experience and these attempts, it seems about 10-20% might have a clear, accurate, and well-articulated understanding across all parts of the question, considering both content and language.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
