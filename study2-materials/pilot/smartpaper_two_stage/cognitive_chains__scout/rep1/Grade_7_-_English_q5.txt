15

I estimate that around 15% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

Many students have struggled to express themselves clearly in English, using phrases like "the poem say" and simple sentences. Some have also demonstrated a lack of vocabulary, using words like "qwestian" instead of "question". However, a few students have shown an ability to understand and describe the squirrel's tail in a way that matches the rubric.

I've taken into account that around 2-3 students (Attempts 1, 4) out of 5 have provided reasonably accurate descriptions, although not perfectly worded. Given the overall ability distribution in my classroom, I conservatively estimate 15% of students would be able to accurately answer this question and score full marks.
