5

I estimate that only 5% of my 500 students, i.e., 25 students, would score full marks on this question. 

Upon reviewing the attempts, I notice that only Student Attempt 3 accurately defines and distinguishes between autotrophic and heterotrophic modes of nutrition, using correct terminology ("photosynthesis" is not required but implied). However, even in this attempt, there is a minor error ("photosinthesis" instead of "photosynthesis"). 

Most students demonstrated a basic understanding of the concepts, but their responses were often hampered by:

1. **Spelling and grammatical errors**, e.g., "autotrohic," "hetrotroph," "they are doing fotosynthesis," which indicate a lack of familiarity with scientific vocabulary.

2. **Limited vocabulary**, e.g., "make food" instead of "synthesize food" or proper terms.

3. **Inconsistent or imprecise definitions**, e.g., equating heterotrophs with simply "eating others" without clarifying that this involves obtaining nutrients.

Considering the distribution of abilities in my classroom, I have observed that:

* A significant number of students struggle with expressing their knowledge in English.
* A moderate number of students show some understanding but lack precision.
* A few students exhibit a strong command of scientific vocabulary and concepts.

Therefore, I anticipate that only a small fraction of my students can produce a clear, accurate response like Student Attempt 3, warranting a score of 5%. 

The question's requirement for proper definitions and distinctions means even students who have some knowledge may not meet the full-mark criteria due to their expression and language skills.
