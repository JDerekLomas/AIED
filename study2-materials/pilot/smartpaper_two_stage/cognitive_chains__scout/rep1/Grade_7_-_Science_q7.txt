20

I'm estimating that around 20% of my 500 students, i.e., 100 students would score full marks on this question. 

Here's my justification:

- Many students have demonstrated an understanding that the yellowing of leaves is related to a lack of nitrogen.
- Some students have also suggested the use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers like urea.

However, to score full marks, students need to:
- Specifically mention that the yellowing of leaves and stunted growth are due to a nitrogen deficiency.
- Recommend the addition of fertilizers/manures rich in the lacking nutrient (nitrogen).

While many students have shown an understanding of the basic concepts, their answers are often phrased poorly due to struggles with English, or they're unable to explicitly state the steps the farmer should take. Only a small fraction of students would be able to express their ideas in a clear, scientifically accurate manner that aligns with the rubric, hence the estimated 20%.
