I arrived at this estimate by analyzing the attempts provided and considering the typical distribution of abilities in my classroom.

Attempts 1 and 4 show a good understanding of two factors contributing to nationalist sentiment in Europe, including the French Revolution and common language. However, they still have some issues with grammar, vocabulary, and clarity.

Attempts 2, 3, and 5 are more limited, with only one clear factor mentioned and significant issues with grammar and vocabulary.

Given that only a few students can clearly and correctly articulate one or two valid factors, and considering the challenges many students face with English, I estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. These advanced students can express their ideas more fluently and accurately in English, meeting the rubric requirements for full marks.
