I estimate that only about 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. The attempts I reviewed showed a range of understanding, but most students seemed to have a basic idea of what a fable is, but struggled to articulate a clear and complete definition. Many used simple sentences and relied on examples rather than providing a clear definition. Only a small proportion of students demonstrated a clear understanding of the key elements of a fable, and I expect only a few to have written a precise definition that would score full marks.
