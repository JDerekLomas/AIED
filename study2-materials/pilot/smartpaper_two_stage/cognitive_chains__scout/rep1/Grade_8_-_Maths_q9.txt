Based on the attempts provided and my experience with 500 Class 8 students, I would estimate that around 20 students, which is 4% of the total, would score full marks on this question.

Many students struggle with understanding the concept of discount and profit, and there are also issues with calculations and applying formulas correctly. Only a few students, like Student Attempt 3, seem to have a clear understanding of the problem and calculate the correct answer. However, even among those, there are calculation errors or incorrect applications of formulas.

Given the general level of understanding and competency in my classroom, I believe 4% is a realistic estimate of students who would score full marks.
