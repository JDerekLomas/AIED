20

Reasoning: 

Upon reviewing the attempts, I notice that only a few students have been able to articulate clear, relevant, and plausible ways to improve transparency in governance. Attempts 1, 2, 4, and 5 suggest using technology (internet, computer, website) to increase transparency, and also mention RTI (Right to Information) which is a relevant concept. Attempt 3 is close but has some spelling and grammar errors.

However, most students have struggled with English language, as evident from the spelling and grammar errors, and the simplistic vocabulary used. Considering the distribution of ability in my classroom, I estimate that around 20% of students would be able to clearly and correctly articulate a plausible way to improve transparency in governance, and hence score full marks. The rest would either have incorrect or incomplete answers, or struggle with expressing their ideas coherently.
