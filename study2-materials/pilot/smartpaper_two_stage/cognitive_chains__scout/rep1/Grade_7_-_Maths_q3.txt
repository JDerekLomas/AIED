5

My reasoning is as follows: 

- Most students have attempted to use the formula for the area, but unfortunately, they have used an incorrect formula (base x height) instead of the correct one (1/2 x base x height).
- Only one student (in attempt 5) has used an incorrect formula but still gotten the right answer due to careless error on the part of the student checking, I have considered even such cases where right answer may appear despite wrong approach
- A few students have displayed some lack of literacy - ‘hieght’, ‘triangel’, ‘bbreadth’, a general trend across most of capability ranges 
Overall, given an entire spread I sense and the usual learning curves typical observed through a session with such exercises , less but not too low 

Reflectively around or slightly touching a double-digit would reflect fair representation on class averages especially going forward next  assessment checkpoints usually standard practices in curriculum planning etc
