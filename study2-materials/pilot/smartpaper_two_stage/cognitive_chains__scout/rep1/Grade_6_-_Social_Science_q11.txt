My reasoning:
 
- A few students provided 2 clear and valid reasons, demonstrating a good understanding of the necessity of traffic rules (Attempts 1, 2, 5). 
- Many students provided 2 reasons but struggled to articulate coherent sentences in English (Attempts 3 and 4).
- Most students wrote brief sentences that expressed correct ideas but lacked completeness and depth. Even correct ideas got expressed immaturely or in disarray.
- Grammar seems widespread weakness affecting mainly understanding at the margins for good thoughts.
