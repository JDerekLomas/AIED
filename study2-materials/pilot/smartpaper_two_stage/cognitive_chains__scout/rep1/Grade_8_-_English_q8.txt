Rationale: 

Based on my experience and the sample attempts provided, I assess that only a small fraction of students would accurately convert both sentences into passive voice.

- Student Attempt 1 shows understanding but has minor errors (capitalization and missing article).
- Student Attempt 2 lacks capitalization and grammatical articles.
- Student Attempt 3 correctly converts sentences but lacks the article in both.
- Student Attempt 4 shows verb tense inconsistency and a minor spelling error.
- Student Attempt 5 demonstrates subject-verb agreement issues.

Given these examples reflect a range of common errors, I estimate around 10% of 500 students would accurately complete the conversion to passive voice for both sentences without any errors, thus scoring full marks. Most students struggle with nuances of English grammar, vocabulary, and syntax.
