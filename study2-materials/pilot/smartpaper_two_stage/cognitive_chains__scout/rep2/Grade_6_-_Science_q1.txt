Considering the attempts provided, it's clear that a significant number of students have demonstrated an understanding of the concept of magnetic repulsion, albeit with varying degrees of clarity and accuracy in their expression.

Attempts 1, 2, 4, and 5 correctly convey that when the North pole of one magnet is brought near the North pole of another, they push away or repel each other, using terms like "replusion," "repling," "repal," and "re-pulse." These attempts, despite minor errors in terminology or grammar, show a clear understanding of the phenomenon.

Attempt 3 uses the term "repull," which might imply a misunderstanding, but still suggests that the student grasped the concept of the magnets not attracting or "being friends."

Given the classroom distribution of abilities and assuming that students' understanding isn't drastically different from these examples, I'd estimate the following:

- A notable portion of students would clearly articulate the correct phenomenon (as in Attempts 1, 2, 4, 5).
- A smaller number might have a partial or slightly mistaken understanding (like Attempt 3).

Given my experience with 500 Class 6 students, where language barriers, varying comprehension levels, and conceptual understanding play significant roles, I'd estimate around 40% of my students would accurately and clearly state that the magnets repel or push away each other with no significant errors.
