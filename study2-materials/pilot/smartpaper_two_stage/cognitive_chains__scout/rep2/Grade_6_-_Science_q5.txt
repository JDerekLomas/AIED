27

Here's my reasoning:

* Attempts 1, 2, 4 are almost correct, but they don't mention the color change to blue-black or specifically state that iodine solution is used. Still, they have most of the key elements, so I assume around 60-70% of students would get this much.
* Attempts 3 is almost perfect, as it mentions the color change to black or purple. 
* Attempt 5 uses "blue ink" instead of iodine solution, which indicates a lack of understanding.

Considering the distribution of abilities in my classroom, I'd estimate around 20-30% of students would score full marks, getting every detail exactly right. To give a precise number, I'm going to say 27%. This accounts for the fact that many students struggle with English and specifics of scientific vocabulary and procedures.
