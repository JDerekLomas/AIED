To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks on this question, I must consider the variety and quality of attempts provided. From the attempts shown:

- Student Attempt 1 lists the factors as 1, 2, 4, 34, 68, missing 17.
- Student Attempt 2 correctly lists the factors as 1, 2, 4, 17, 34, 68.
- Student Attempt 3 incorrectly includes 16 and misses 17.
- Student Attempt 4 correctly lists the factors as 1, 2, 4, 17, 34, 68.
- Student Attempt 5 also correctly lists the factors as 1, 2, 4, 17, 34, 68, showing a clear understanding.

The question requires students to list all the factors of 68 correctly: 1, 2, 4, 17, 34, 68. Given the marking and common errors observed across these attempts:

1. Some students have a clear and complete understanding (Attempts 2, 4, 5).
2. A couple of students display confusion or incomplete knowledge (Attempts 1, 3).

Given my experience and considering a typical distribution of ability in a government school in India:

- A significant portion might struggle significantly, either due to language barriers or gaps in basic mathematical understanding.
- Only a smaller fraction usually demonstrates a thorough and accurate grasp of the concepts, especially in questions that require basic but precise knowledge like this.

Considering the variety of common errors and the general level of understanding displayed by these attempts, I estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would manage to list all the factors of 68 correctly.

Percentage scoring full marks: 20
