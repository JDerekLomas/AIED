Based on the attempts provided, it seems that many students have a fragile understanding of place value, and some seem to be guessing or providing random answers.

Attempts 1, 2, and 3 demonstrate a lack of understanding of the concept of place value, with students providing incorrect answers and rationales. Attempt 4 shows a correct understanding, but Attempt 5, although similar to Attempt 4, doesn't quite get the correct answer.

Out of 500 students, I would estimate that around 20-25 students would have a solid grasp of the concept and provide the correct answer. This might be a generous estimate, given the common difficulties students face with this concept.

Therefore, my estimate of the percentage of students who would score full marks is: 5

This represents my expectation that about 5% of the students, or roughly 25 out of 500, would answer the question correctly.
