20

My reasoning: Looking at the attempts provided, I can see that many students are able to get at least one or two articles correct, but only a few seem to have mastered all three. Specifically, the use of "an" before "elephant" seems to be a challenge for most students. Given that I've seen similar errors in my own classroom, I estimate that only about 20% of my 500 students would be able to get all three articles correct, i.e., "an elephant", "a tiger", and "the zoo". This seems like an ambitious target, but I've seen a few bright students in my class who consistently perform well in English grammar. The majority, however, struggle with even basic concepts. 

The question attempts I have seen suggest to me a typical range of understanding: the best students get it right, the average ones might get one or two right and the weakest might get none right. My own teaching and student assessments over the years suggest to me that the distribution of results on this task will reflect that typical pattern, hence leading to estimate the 20% figure for a mark for full marks.
