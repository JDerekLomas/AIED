A tough task! After analyzing these attempts, I'd estimate that around 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Here's my reasoning:

* Most students are able to identify a line from the poem they like, but their explanations are simplistic, brief, or lack coherence.
* Only a few students (e.g., Attempt 3) show a somewhat clear and relevant reason for liking a line.
* Spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasing are common, suggesting that many students struggle with English.
* To score full marks, a student needs to:
	1. Denote a specific line from the poem (which many do).
	2. Provide a clear and relevant reason for liking that line (which few do).

Given the distribution of ability in my classroom, I expect a small proportion of students to demonstrate the required level of proficiency in English to score full marks. Therefore, my estimate is 5%.
