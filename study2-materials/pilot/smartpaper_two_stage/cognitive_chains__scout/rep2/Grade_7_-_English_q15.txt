I estimate that only 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. This is because, based on the attempts provided, even the better attempts (e.g. Student Attempt 2) lack proper grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. Most students struggle with verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and sentence coherence. Given that only a small proportion of students demonstrate a good command of English, I expect only a few to write a complete and coherent paragraph that meets the rubric's requirements.
