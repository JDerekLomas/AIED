Rationale: Based on the attempts provided, it seems that many students have an idea of the meaning of "shining brightly" and are able to relate it to the word "glowing" or similar variations. However, not all students are able to spell the word correctly or find it in the passage.

From the attempts, we see that:

* Some students (e.g. Attempt 1) have a good understanding of the meaning and are able to find the correct word or its synonym.
* Some students (e.g. Attempts 2, 3, 4, 5) have an idea of the meaning but struggle with spelling or finding the exact word in the passage.
* The variations in spelling (e.g. "glouing", "glowin", "glownig", "glowwing") suggest that many students are not confident in their writing or may not have proofread their work.

Given that this is a relatively simple question and considering the distribution of ability in my classroom, I estimate that around 30% of students would score full marks, i.e., write the correct answer "glowing" (or accept "glowin" / "gloing" as acceptable variations) without any errors.
