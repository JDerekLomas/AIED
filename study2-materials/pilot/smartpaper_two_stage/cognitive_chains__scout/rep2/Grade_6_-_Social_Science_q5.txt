5

I estimate that only 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

Most students have attempted to answer the question, but their responses are plagued by grammatical errors, simplistic vocabulary, and a lack of clarity. While some students have managed to convey basic ideas about the Vedic period, such as the importance of cattle rearing or farming, their answers often fail to meet the specific requirements of the question.

Many students have provided responses similar to Attempts 1, 2, and 3, which, although showing some understanding, are marred by poor English and lack of coherence. Attempts 4 and 5, although better, still fall short of the expected standard.

Given the struggles evident in these attempts, I believe that only a small fraction of my students, likely around 5%, have the language proficiency, historical knowledge, and writing skills to craft a clear, accurate, and well-structured response that would score full marks.
