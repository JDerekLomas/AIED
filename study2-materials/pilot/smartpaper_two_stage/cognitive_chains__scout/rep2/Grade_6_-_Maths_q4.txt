## Step 1: Analyze the student attempts to identify common errors and correct methods.
Student attempts 1, 2, 4, and 5 demonstrate a correct method for finding the LCM using the common division method, but attempts 1, 2, and 5 incorrectly calculate the final product as 50 instead of 60. Student attempt 3 uses a mix of methods but incorrectly concludes the LCM is 20, likely due to not fully following the division method.

## 2: Determine the correct answer and method.
The correct LCM of 12, 15, and 20 is calculated as follows:
- Using the division method:
  - $2 \space | \underline{ 12, 15, 20 }$
  - $2 \space | \underline{ \space 6, \space 15, 10 }$
  - $3 \space | \underline{ \space 3, \space 15, \space 5 }$
  - $5 \space | \underline{ \space 1, \space 5, \space 5 }$
  - $\space \space \space | \space \space 1, \space \space 1, \space \space 1$
- LCM = $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5 = 60$

## 3: Evaluate the attempts based on the correct method and rubric.
- Only students who correctly find the LCM using a proper method (like the division method) and calculate it correctly to be 60 would score full marks.
- Attempts 1, 2, and 5 are close but contain calculation errors leading to an incorrect answer.
- Attempt 4 correctly calculates the LCM to be 60.

## 4: Consider the distribution of ability in the classroom.
Given the diversity in student attempts, it's clear that many students have some understanding of the method but struggle with accurate calculations or completing the process correctly.

## 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks.
Based on the attempts provided, it seems that a small fraction of students fully understand and correctly apply the method to find the LCM. Assuming these attempts are representative of the broader class performance, and noting that only attempt 4 perfectly aligns with the correct answer and method, we estimate the proportion.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$
