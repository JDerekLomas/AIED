Rationale: 

Most of my students have a basic understanding of mathematical concepts, but when it comes to English literacy and following the exact format of formulas, they often struggle. Attempts 1-3 indicate a fundamental lack of understanding of the formula, or an inability to express it accurately in English. Attempts 4 and 5 indicate that some students do know the formula, but either forget to apply it correctly (Attempt 4) or simply do not use it (Attempt 5).

Given that only Attempt 4 shows a clear understanding of the formula and its correct application, and considering the distribution of abilities in my class, I estimate that about 20% of the students (around 1 in 5) would score full marks on this question. This reflects the contrast between a smaller number of more competent students and the rest who would need more support.
