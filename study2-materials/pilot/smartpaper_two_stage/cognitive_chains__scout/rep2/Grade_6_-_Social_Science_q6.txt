Based on the attempts provided and my experience with the class, I estimate that around 15% of the 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The attempts showcase a range of understanding, from partially correct to largely incorrect. Most students have a basic idea of what archaeological and literary sources are, but their expressions are often imperfect, and examples are sometimes inappropriate. Only a small fraction of students, like Student Attempt 4, demonstrate a clear and correct understanding of both concepts and provide relevant examples.

Considering the overall competency of my class, with many students facing challenges with English and only a few being advanced, I believe 15% is a reasonable estimate of students who would score full marks.
