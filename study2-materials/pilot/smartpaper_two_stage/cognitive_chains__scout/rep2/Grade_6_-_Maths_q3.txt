Based on the provided attempts, it seems that a significant number of students are able to identify the smallest number (736) and place it first, which is the criteria for scoring full marks (0.5). 

Most of the students (Attempts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) were able to identify 736 as the smallest number and place it first. However, not all students provided correct arrangements of the remaining numbers. 

Assuming this is a typical representation of my class of 500 students, I estimate that around 65% of students would be able to correctly identify the smallest number (736) and place it first. 

Percentage scoring full marks: 65
