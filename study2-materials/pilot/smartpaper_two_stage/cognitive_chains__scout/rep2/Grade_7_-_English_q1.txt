My reasoning is based on the attempts provided, which seem to reflect the general level of English proficiency and comprehension in my class. Most students have been able to grasp the basic idea that the king wants to know three things, but only a few have been able to express them accurately. 

Attempts 1, 4, and 5 demonstrate a good understanding of the king's goals and a clear expression of his questions, but may have minor errors in grammar, vocabulary, or phrasing. Attempt 2 seems to lack some detail and clarity, while Attempt 3 appears to be a bit simplistic.

Considering the mix of ability levels in my class, I estimate that only about 5% of my students would be able to answer the question with perfect accuracy, using precise vocabulary and grammatically correct sentences. Many students struggle with expressing their ideas in standard English, and an even smaller number would be able to recall and apply the exact phrases from the passage. Therefore, I predict that only a small proportion will score full marks.
