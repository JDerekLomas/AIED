Considering the variety of attempts provided, it's clear that many students have a good understanding of the multiplication of integers and some are aware of the rule that two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive result. However, the attempts also reveal common misconceptions and struggles with applying the sign rules.

- Student Attempt 1 incorrectly applies the sign rule by concluding that two negative signs result in a negative, which seems to stem from a misunderstanding or misremembering of the rule.
- Student Attempt 2 correctly applies the rule that "minus and minus make plus" and reaches the correct answer, indicating a good understanding.
- Student Attempt 3 incorrectly recalls the teacher's instruction about the sign, believing it results in a minus, which shows confusion.
- Student Attempt 4 mistakenly believes that two negative numbers result in a negative product, similar to Attempt 1, indicating a lack of understanding or incorrect learning.
- Student Attempt 5 interestingly introduces the concept of comparing the size of numbers and their signs but still achieves the wrong conclusion due to an incorrect application of rules.

Given these observations and considering the diversity of abilities and common misconceptions among 500 Class 7 students in a government school, it seems that only a small fraction would clearly understand and correctly apply both the multiplication fact and the sign rule to achieve the full mark. Hence, estimating around 20% would score full marks seems reasonable, assuming that only a fifth of the students have completely grasped the concept and can apply it accurately without confusion.
