The attempts given showcase a range of understanding, but most students are struggling to express themselves in grammatically correct English and to directly reference the poem. Given that the majority of my students are still developing their language skills and tend to provide simplistic answers, I estimate that only a very small fraction of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. The students who score full marks would likely be the ones who have a good grasp of English and can effectively communicate the theme of the poem, which is a rare skill in my experience, especially at the Class 6 level. Therefore, I estimate that 5% of my students would score full marks.
