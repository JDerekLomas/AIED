I estimate that only 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

Most students have attempted to explain why cotton is preferred in summer, but their answers are limited by their understanding of English and scientific concepts. While many have identified that cotton "drinks" or "soaks" sweat, which is a good start, few have clearly articulated a specific property of cotton that makes it suitable for hot weather, such as being a good absorber of water or allowing air to pass through.

Additionally, I have to consider that many of my students struggle with English, which impacts their ability to express scientific ideas clearly. Given these challenges, I expect only a small proportion of students to score full marks.
