Based on the attempts provided, it seems that only a few students have accurately understood the concepts and can express their thoughts clearly. Let's evaluate the attempts:

- Student Attempt 1: Partially correct but struggles with English and understanding.
- Student Attempt 2: Similar to Attempt 1, with basic understanding but poor English.
- Student Attempt 3: Struggles with vocabulary and concept expression.
- Student Attempt 4: Understands (a) and (b) reasonably well but lacks precise terminology.
- Student Attempt 5: Shows a good understanding of all parts but still uses informal language.

Given the provided attempts and assuming they are representative of the overall performance, it's clear that:

- Many students struggle with English, which affects their ability to articulate scientific concepts accurately.
- The concept of photosynthesis (part c) is not clearly understood by most.
- Part (b) of the question, which requires an understanding of why growth is least in darkness, is often answered with simplistic reasoning (e.g., "no light," "plant cannot see").

Full marks require not just a basic understanding but also the ability to express it correctly in English, using appropriate scientific terms like "photosynthesis." Given the range of understanding and expression seen, and taking into consideration the typical distribution of abilities in a classroom:

I estimate around 10% of students would score full marks, assuming a conservative assessment of understanding and expression across the 500 students.

Percentage scoring full marks: 10
