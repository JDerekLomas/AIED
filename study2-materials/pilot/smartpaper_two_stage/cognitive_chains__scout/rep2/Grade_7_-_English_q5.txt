I have based my estimate on the variety of attempts provided, noting that some students have demonstrated a clear understanding of the question, even with limited language proficiency. About 1 in 4 students seems to have captured the idea of the squirrel's tail being like a question mark.

Attempt 4 shows a relatively more detailed understanding and seems advanced, while Attempts 1, 2, and 3 demonstrate partial understanding but with significant grammatical errors. Attempt 5 seems to grasp the core idea but with similar errors.

Considering the spread of abilities and based on a typical classroom performance distribution where few excel, a significant number struggle, and the rest perform moderately, I infer a quarter of my students can accurately recount specific details from the poem.
