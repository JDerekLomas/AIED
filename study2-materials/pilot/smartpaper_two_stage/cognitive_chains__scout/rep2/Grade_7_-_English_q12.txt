Reasoning: 

Most of the attempts I've seen (Attempts 1-4) show a similar pattern of errors, where the student seems to understand the basic transformation but struggles with subject-verb agreement ("leaves" is a plural noun and requires a plural verb form) and the correct form of the verb ("blow" needs to be in the past participle form "blown" to form the passive voice). 

Attempt 5 shows a different type of error, with the student incorrectly pluralizing "leaf" and using the wrong verb form.

Given that I've seen these types of errors consistently across many students, I estimate that only a small proportion of my students would be able to get it entirely correct. Based on my experience, I'd say around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. This is because only a few students typically demonstrate a strong grasp of grammatical concepts, including voice transformations, and can apply them correctly in this context.
