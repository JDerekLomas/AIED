## Step 1: Understanding the task
The task requires estimating the proportion of 500 Class 7 students who would score full marks on a question that involves multiplying two mixed fractions and expressing the answer as a mixed fraction.

## 2: Analyzing the attempts
Analyzing the given attempts:
- Most students (Attempts 1, 2, 4, 5) correctly converted the mixed fractions to improper fractions (`3/2` and `13/4`), multiplied them to get `39/6`, and then expressed the result as a mixed fraction (`6 3/6`).
- One student (Attempt 3) incorrectly converted the second mixed fraction to `7/4` instead of `13/4`, leading to an incorrect product and mixed fraction.

## 3: Identifying correct steps
To score full marks, students need to:
1. Correctly convert `1 1/2` to `3/2`.
2. Correctly convert `3 1/4` to `13/4`.
3. Multiply these fractions to get `39/6`.
4. Express `39/6` as a mixed fraction, which simplifies to `6 3/6` or further to `6 1/2`.

## 4: Evaluating student performance
From the attempts provided:
- Attempts 1, 2, 4, and 5 demonstrate a complete understanding and correct process, resulting in the correct answer.
- Attempt 3 shows a misunderstanding in converting the second mixed fraction.

## 5: Estimating proportion of students scoring full marks
Given that most of the provided attempts (4 out of 5) demonstrate the correct process and understanding, and considering the distribution of ability in a typical classroom where many students struggle with such concepts:

## 6: Considering classroom distribution
In an Indian government school, the distribution of ability can be quite varied, with a significant portion of students facing challenges with mathematical concepts, especially those requiring a good grasp of fractions and conversions.

## 7: Experience-based estimation
Based on teaching experience, it's reasonable to assume that around 20-30% of students might have a strong grasp of fractions and mixed numbers, being able to perform such operations accurately.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$
