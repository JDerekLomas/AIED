Based on the attempts provided and my experience teaching Class 7 students in an Indian government school, I estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The attempts shown demonstrate varying levels of understanding, from straightforward calculations to clear comprehension of the problem. However, even in these examples, there are noticeable errors in spelling, grammar, and presentation.

Given the distribution of abilities in my classroom, I anticipate that only a relatively small proportion of students would be able to provide a correct and well-presented answer, scoring the full 0.5 marks. Factors such as language barriers, calculation errors, and careless mistakes would likely reduce the number of students achieving full marks.

Therefore, my estimate is: 20.
