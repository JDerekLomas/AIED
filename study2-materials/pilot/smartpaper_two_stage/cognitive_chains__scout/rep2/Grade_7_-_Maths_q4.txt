## Step 1: Reviewing Student Attempts
Reviewing the attempts provided, it's clear that students have different levels of understanding and application of mathematical concepts, particularly in handling decimals and division.

## 2: Identifying Common Mistakes and Understanding
Most students attempted to remove the decimal by multiplying both the dividend and divisor by 10 (or adding a zero), which is a correct approach. However, the execution and presentation varied significantly.

## 3: Assessing Conceptual Understanding
Students like those in Attempts 1, 2, 4, and 5 demonstrated a basic understanding of how to handle the division by converting 8 ÷ 7.2 into 80 ÷ 72, and then performing the division to get approximately 1.1. Attempt 3 showed a more algebraic approach but also arrived at a similar conclusion.

## 4: Evaluating Procedural Accuracy
The key to scoring full marks is not just understanding the concept but also executing it accurately. Most students successfully converted the division problem into 80 ÷ 72 but varied in their calculation and presentation of the answer.

## 5: Considering Classroom Distribution
Given the distribution of ability in a typical Indian government school classroom, where many students struggle with English and mathematical concepts, a small proportion are usually advanced.

## 6: Estimating Full Marks
Based on the attempts provided, it seems that about half of the students demonstrated a clear understanding of how to approach the problem (converting to 80 ÷ 72), but not all executed it flawlessly or presented it in a manner consistent with full marks.

## 7: Accounting for Variability
There is variability in how students performed the division and presented their answers. For full marks, precision and clarity are crucial.

## 8: Final Estimation
Considering the attempts and assuming a typical distribution of skills in a classroom, I estimate that around 20% of students would have executed the conversion correctly (to 80 ÷ 72) and presented their answer accurately, given the examples provided.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$
