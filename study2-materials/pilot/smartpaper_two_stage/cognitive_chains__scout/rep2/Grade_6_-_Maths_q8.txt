Based on the attempts I've reviewed, I would estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Many students struggled with basic concepts, such as calculating the area (e.g., adding instead of multiplying, incorrect multiplication) and understanding vocabulary (e.g., "lenth" instead of "length", "bredth" instead of "breadth"). Some students also showed a lack of understanding of formulas for area and perimeter. Only a few students showed a good grasp of both concepts.

In my experience, about 20% of students demonstrate a strong understanding of mathematical concepts and can apply them accurately, while the rest struggle to varying degrees. Hence, my estimate is 20%.
