Rationale: 
Considering the attempts provided, it's striking that while many students can associate lions with the national emblem and its presence on currency notes, only a couple of them accurately mention both that it's from the Lion Capital of Ashoka and correctly identify its significance.

Attempts 1 through 5 demonstrate varying degrees of understanding but are mostly incomplete. For instance, some students correctly associate the lion with the national emblem and its appearance on currency notes but fail to explicitly link it to the Lion Capital of Ashoka or accurately explain its significance beyond being a symbol of power.

Given my experience and considering the distribution of abilities in a typical government school classroom, I'd estimate that around 15% of 500 students would be able to clearly and accurately state that lions on Indian currency notes are part of the Lion Capital of Ashoka, which is India's National Emblem, thereby scoring full marks. This estimation accounts for students who are competent in English and have a good grasp of the subject matter.
