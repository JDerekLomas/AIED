40

I've considered the attempts provided, and I think about 40% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question. 

Many students have demonstrated an understanding of the basic concept (e.g., Student Attempt 1, 2, and 4), but their explanations and grammatical skills are limited. A significant number of students seem to confuse 'some' and 'any', or use 'any' when there is a clear presence of something (e.g., Student Attempt 3 and 5). Given the typical distribution of abilities in my classroom, with many students struggling and a few advanced learners, I estimate that about 40% would get it right.
