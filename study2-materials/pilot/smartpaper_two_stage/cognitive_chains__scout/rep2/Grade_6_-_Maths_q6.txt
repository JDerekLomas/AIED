Based on the student attempts provided and my experience teaching Class 6 students in an Indian government school, I'd estimate that around 5% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The main reason for this low estimate is that even simple concepts like calculating the area of a rectangle and a square seem to be challenging for many students. As seen in the provided attempts, most students incorrectly calculated the area of the rectangle by adding the length and width instead of multiplying them. This indicates a significant gap in their understanding of basic mathematical concepts.

Only a small percentage of students, likely the more advanced ones, would be able to correctly calculate the areas and find the difference, earning them full marks. Considering the distribution of ability in my classroom, I believe 5% is a reasonable estimate of students who would score full marks. 

Percentage scoring full marks: 5
