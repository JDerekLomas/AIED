15

Rationale: Based on the attempts provided, it seems that a significant number of students have some understanding of the question but struggle with expressing it in grammatically correct English. Attempts 1-5 show varying degrees of understanding, but only Attempt 4 comes close to providing a coherent and correct reason.

Assuming this is a representative sample of my 500 students, I estimate that around 15% would score full marks. This is because:

* About 20-30 students might have a good understanding of the question and express it well (like Attempt 4).
* A larger number would have some understanding but struggle with language (like Attempts 1-3 and 5).
* Many students would not understand the question at all or provide irrelevant answers.

Given the English proficiency challenges in our classroom, I believe 15% is a reasonable estimate of students who would score full marks.
