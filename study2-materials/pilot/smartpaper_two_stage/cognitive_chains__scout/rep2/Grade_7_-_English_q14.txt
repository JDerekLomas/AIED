Based on the student attempts provided, I would estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

Here's my reasoning:

* Most students (4 out of 5) have a correct understanding of the antonym, with "modern" or "new" being provided as the opposite of "ancient".
* However, the attempts also reveal a significant number of students with spelling difficulties (e.g., "modran" instead of "modern"), grammatical difficulties (e.g., multiple answers provided, or hesitant language), or a struggle to articulate their thoughts.
* A few students seem to be influenced by their teacher's previous feedback, which may not have been effectively internalized.
* Considering the typical distribution of ability in my classroom, I expect a relatively small proportion of advanced students who would confidently and correctly answer "modern" or "new", while a larger proportion would struggle with nuances of language.

Therefore, my estimate is:
