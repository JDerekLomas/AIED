Based on the attempts provided, I'd estimate that around 20% of my 500 students would score full marks on this question.

The attempts show a range of abilities, with some students able to clearly express their message in simple but correct English (Attempts 3, 5), while others struggle with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure (Attempts 1, 2, 4). 

Given the typical distribution of abilities in my classroom, I would expect about 1 in 5 students to be able to craft a clear and correct message that meets the rubric requirements. Hence, my estimate is 20%.
