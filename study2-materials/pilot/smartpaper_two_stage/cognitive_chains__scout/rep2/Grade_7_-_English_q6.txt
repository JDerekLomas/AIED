Rationale: Based on the attempts provided, it seems that a small proportion of students are able to clearly and effectively describe the poet's writing style. Many students use similar phrases and sentences, and their vocabulary is limited. Even among the provided attempts, not all of them accurately and clearly describe the poet's writing style.

In my experience, I have seen that many students in Class 7 struggle with English, particularly with writing and vocabulary. While some students may be able to identify simple adjectives like "easy" or "beautiful", few would be able to use more nuanced vocabulary or provide specific examples from the poem to support their answer.

Assuming a typical distribution of ability in my classroom, I estimate that around 15% of students would be able to provide a clear and accurate description of the poet's writing style, using a suitable and relevant word, and thus score full marks.
