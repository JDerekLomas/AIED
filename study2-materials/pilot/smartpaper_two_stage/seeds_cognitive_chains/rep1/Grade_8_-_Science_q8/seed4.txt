In our farm, many plants grow that we dont want. Like grass and small herbs with the wheat crop. This bad plants are weeds. We do weeding because this plants take all water and minerals. If we dont remove, our crop will be weak and not grow big because weeds are stealing food of the main plants. So it is important for farmers to pull it out.
