Doctor use clinic thermometre because laboratory thermometre is for hot water and science. Clinical thermometre have one bend called kink. This is stopping the mercury to go down fast so doctor see tempereture. If doctor use lab one the mercury fall down quickly when out of mouth and reading is wrong.
