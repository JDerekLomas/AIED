In summer very hot so we wear cotton. 

1. white and light colour do not pull the heat from sun. It reflects the sun rays back so we feel cool.
2. Cotton clothes have small holes. In summer sweat comes from our body and cotton clothes drink the sweat and it make us air. 

that is why light cotton is good.
