In my Kartik chart food is missing vitamins. Milk is not there. Milk gives us big bones. He needs drink milk daily for health.

Diet chart for me:
1. Morning - Roti and tea
2. Lunc - Rice, dal and potato sabji
3. Eve-ning - Biscut 
4. Diner - Roti and dal and milk 

We should eat paleses and vejitabel. Dont eat kurkure.
