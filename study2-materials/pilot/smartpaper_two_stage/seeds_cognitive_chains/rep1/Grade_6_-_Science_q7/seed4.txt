kartik is eating fruit so it is gud for vitamins. but he not drink milk. so his diet is missing Calshium and Protin. for growing children we need to drink milk 2 times every day and eat dal for strong musles.

my diet chart:
morning - milk and paratha
lanch - rice dal and green sabji
evening - banana or apple
night - 2 roti and curd
