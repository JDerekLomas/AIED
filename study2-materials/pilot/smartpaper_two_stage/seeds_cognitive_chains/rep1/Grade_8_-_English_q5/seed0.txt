In this poem the poet Tagore is finding a job. Frist the King came with sward and power but poet say no. Then rich man give gold coins and many money but poet dont want wealth also. Last one girl smile and say her pride is there. But at the end he see a small child playing with shell. Child say i hire you with nothing. This is the last bargin. Poet feel very free and happy here. The main idea is that money and power can not buy happiness but freedom and child inocence is very great thing. These is true joy.
