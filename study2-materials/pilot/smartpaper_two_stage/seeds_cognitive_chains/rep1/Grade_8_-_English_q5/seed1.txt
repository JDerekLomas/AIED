In this poem the man is looking for a job. First king come with sward but the power is no use. Then old man give gold but money is not for happines. Then beautiful girl give smile but it also fade. 

The central idea is that the man is free only with child on beach. Power and money cannot buy true freedom. This is the theme of poem written by Tagore.
