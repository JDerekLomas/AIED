In this poem the poet Tagore is wanting a job. He meet king with sward but power is no use. Then old man give gold but money can not buy hapiness. The beautiful girl smile also finish. At last he meet a small child playing with shels on beach. Child give nothing only freedom. So poet is very happy. This means true freedom and joy is more better than money and power. The central idea is we cannot bargain our soul for gold or proud.
