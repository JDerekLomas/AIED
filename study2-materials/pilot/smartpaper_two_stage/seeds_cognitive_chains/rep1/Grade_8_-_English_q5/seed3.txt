In this poem the poet Rabindranath Tagore is want to say that money and power is not give happy. The old man give gold coins but poet say no. King have big sword and power but it is no use for poet. Then fair lady come but her smile is sadness. At last poet meet small child playing with shells. The child give nothing. Poet is happy because he is free man now. Happiness is in freedom, not money and power.
