In this poem the poet want job. He see king with sward and gold man but he no like power and money. Then beauty girl come she give smile but smile also finish. At last he see child playing with shells. Child give nothing only freedom. So central idea is that true happy come from freedom not from money and power and beauty. The man is free man in the end of poem.
