In my village near the temple there is one big Peepal tree. It is very old tree maybe hundred year old I dont know but my grandfather saying it was there from his childhood. The tree having many green leaves and its branches is very big like arms. Every summer we are sitting under its shadow for cool air because very hot. All small boys and girls play there with marble and gully danda. This tree is like a head of village and every year people do pooja also. We should not cut this old tree because it give us oxygen.
