In my vilage one big banyan tree is there. It is very old, maybe 100 years. It have many branches and green leaves, childs play under it with rope roots. Old mens sit there in evening and talking. My father say his grandfather also saw this tree. This tree is like a head of our village and it give cool shadow to everyone. We worship this tree in some festival.
