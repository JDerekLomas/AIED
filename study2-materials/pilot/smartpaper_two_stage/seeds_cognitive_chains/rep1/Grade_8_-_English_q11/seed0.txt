The big banyan tree in my village is very old and very big. My grandfather tell me it is 100 years old since he was small boy. Tree has many long roots like hair coming down to ground. We play on the roots with my friends everyday after school. Under the tree there is a small stone for God Shiva where people do puja in morning. It give very good shade and cool air in hot summer time. This tree is like our family member and everyone loves it very much.
