In my village near the temple there is one big Banyan tree. It is very old tree maybe 100 years more my grandfather told me. Its branches are very long and hanging down like ropes for kids playing. Many peoples sit under the shadow in summer for cold air. In fastivals we put some puja and diya there. This tree is like a head of our village. it give oxygen and fruits. I like very much.
