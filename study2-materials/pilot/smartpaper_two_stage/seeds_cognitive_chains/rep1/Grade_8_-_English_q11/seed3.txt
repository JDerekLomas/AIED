In my village near the temple there is one big Peepal tree. It is very old tree maybe 100 years or more my grandfather telling. His trunks is very thick and many birds and monkeys living in branches. The leaves are very big and giving good shadow in summer time for everyone. People worship the tree and putting water and many mens sit under tree to talk. It is like our friend and very strong tree in village.
