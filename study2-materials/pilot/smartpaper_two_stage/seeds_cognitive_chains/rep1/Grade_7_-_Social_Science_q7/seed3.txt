Money is very very importent. For buy things like cloth, food and books we need money. If we dont have money then how can shopkeper give items? So money helps in building big shops and schools. Economic development means every people get rich and money makes work fastly.

Digital money means using mobile and phone pay. My father pay recharge on shop with mobile and net banking. It is good because no need to carry many cash in pocket but sometimes network is failing and then payment not coming. So digital is very easy today but net problem is there. Money makes country grow big.
