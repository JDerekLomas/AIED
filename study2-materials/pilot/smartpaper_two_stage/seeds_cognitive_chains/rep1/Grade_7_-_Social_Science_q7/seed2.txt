Money is very very importent in our life. Without money no business can start. In shops we give money and buy goods so money is helpfull for everyone to buy things easily. If there is no money how can country grow? So it helps to develop big schools and hospitals. Now days digital money is also coming. My father use Google Pay to send money in village. It is fast and no need to carry heavy notes but sometimes network problem and internet problem come. So it is both good and some problem also there. Money is very nessasary for progress.
