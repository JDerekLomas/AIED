Money is very very importent in India. For development we buy things from market and shop. If money is there then school and road can be making. Before there was barter systum where we exchange cow for grain but it was hard. Now digital money is there. I use PhonePe in father mobile for pay milk shop. It is fast but sometime network is failing then money is stucking in bank. Money make every people work and grow.
