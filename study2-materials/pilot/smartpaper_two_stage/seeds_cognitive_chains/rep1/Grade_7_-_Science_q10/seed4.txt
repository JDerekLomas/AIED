In our life we use vinegar and baking soda. If bee bite then it is acid so we put baking soda. Wasp is oposite. It is call Nutralization. This means acid and base meet and finish each other and no pain happen. Because baking soda is base it kils bee acid. Vinegar is acid it kils wasp. Same side oposite.
