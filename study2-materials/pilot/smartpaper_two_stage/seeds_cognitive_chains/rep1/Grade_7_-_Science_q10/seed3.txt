When bee sting me, it is very paining because of acid. Wasp sting have base liquid inside it. My teacher say vinegar is acid. So when we put vinegar on wasp sting, it make it quiet. Baking soda is base. Bee sting is acid, so baking soda cut the acid. 

This chemistery rule is naturalise process. Both thing is opposite so they fight and cancel. My mummy also use soap if bee bitting.
