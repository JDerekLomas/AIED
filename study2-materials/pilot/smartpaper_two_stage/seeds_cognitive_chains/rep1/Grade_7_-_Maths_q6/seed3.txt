first $1 \frac{1}{2}$ will be $2 \times 1 + 1$ so it is $3/2$
then $3 \frac{1}{4}$ is $4 \times 3$ is 12 and $12+1 = 13$ so $13/4$

now multiplying both number
$3/2 \times 13/4$
$3 \times 13 = 39$
$2 \times 4 = 8$

so ans is $39/8$
making it mix fraction $39 \div 8$
8 table... $8, 16, 24, 32, 40$
so 32 is coming on 4. remander is 7.

Answer is $4 \frac{7}{8}$
