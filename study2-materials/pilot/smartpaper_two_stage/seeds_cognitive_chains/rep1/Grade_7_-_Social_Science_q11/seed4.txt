In india we have 2 type of hospitel. Public and privet.

1. Public hospitel is runing by goverment. It is very cheep and poor peple go there for medisine but very much crowd and big line is there.

2. Privet hospitel is own by privet doctors. It is very fast and clean but cost is too high for rich peple only. My fater said privet give more medisine for money.
