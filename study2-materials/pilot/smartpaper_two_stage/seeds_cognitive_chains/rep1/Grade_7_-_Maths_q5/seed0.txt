Total value of coins

10 coins of 10 paise = 10 x 10 = 100 paise = 1 rs
5 coins of 20 paise = 5 x 20 = 100 paise = 1 rs
16 coins of 50 paise = 16 x 50 = 80 paise. no it is 800 paise.
800 paise means 8 rs

so total money = 1 + 1 + 8 = 10 rupess.

How many 5 rupee coin we can make.
So 10 / 5 = 2.

Ans is 2 coins.
