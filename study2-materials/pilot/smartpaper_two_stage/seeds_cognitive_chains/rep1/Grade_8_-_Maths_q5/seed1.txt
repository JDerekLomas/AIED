The quetion is {9/16 x 4/12} + {9/16 x (-3/9)}

Hear common number is 9/16. So using distritube proparty:
= 9/16 x (4/12 + -3/9)

Now i do lcm of 12 and 9. 
12, 9 ... lcm is 36.

= 9/16 x (12/36 - 12/36) 
No... wait.
4/12 = 4 x 3 = 12 / 36
3/9 = 3 x 4 = 12 / 36

= 9/16 x (12-12 / 36)
= 9/16 x 0/36
= 0

Ans is 0.
