a) 110 degree
[The student has drawn a line using a scale. They have placed the protractor but used the inner scale instead of the outer scale, or vice-versa. The resulting angle looks like 70° (acute) instead of 110° (obtuse). The vertex is slightly messy with over-writing.]

b) 40 degree 
[The student has drawn a straight line and marked a point. This angle looks more or less correct, around 40°, but the lines are wavy and not perfectly straight.]
