To make angle we need scale and d-box. 

a) 110 degree
i keep protractor on line and mark. my angle look big like this:

                      /
                     /
  _________/

(Note: Teacher, i use outer scale or inner scale? I think 110 is obtous angle so it is bigger than l-shape.)

b) 40 degree 
this is small angle. 

         /
