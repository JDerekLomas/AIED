Ans (a) -  i take ruler and draw line. Then i keep prodactor on the point. 110 degree is more than 90. I mark 110 from right side. My angle is big angle.

(Student draws an angle that actually looks like 70° because they used the inner scale of the protractor instead of the outer scale, starting from the wrong side).

Ans (b) - this is 40. 

/___ 40 degree 

(The student draws a rough acute angle without using a ruler properly).
