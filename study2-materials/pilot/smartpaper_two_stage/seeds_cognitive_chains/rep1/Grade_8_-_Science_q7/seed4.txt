Yes sir, after some days waste is goning. All waste will change and it become black like mitti. I think small insects eat the plant and vegetable waste so it change. This is good for farm because it is natural khat (manure). Soil get more power and plants grow fastly. So gardener is happy to put it in khet. It is bio waste and help soil health.
