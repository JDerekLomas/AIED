yes teacher the gardener see some change. all waste will go in mud and color change to black. after few day it smell little but then it become manure (khaad). 

Reason is bacteria and insects eat the waste. this is good for soil health because it make soil fertile and plant grow big and green. No chemical needed so it is healthy.
