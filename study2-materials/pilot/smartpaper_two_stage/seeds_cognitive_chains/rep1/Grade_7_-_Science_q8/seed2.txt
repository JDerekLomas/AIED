I will put turmeric in bottle. If water becomes Red colour then it is Base. 
Now I use hibiscus. I put some hibiscus juice in bottle liquid. If it turns Dark Pink or Megenta colour then it is Acid. 
Turmeric also indicator but not changing in acid. It is yellow. I think yellow is neutral but for acid hibiscus is good. Red color mean strong base. My science teacher show this in lab.
