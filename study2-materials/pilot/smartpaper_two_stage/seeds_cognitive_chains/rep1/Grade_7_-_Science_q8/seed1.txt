sir first i take turmeric and mix in litle water to make paste. then i put in liquid. if liquid is blue it is base and if red it is acid. no sorry, turmeric color change red in washing soda so it is base. and hibiskus flower if we put in water it becomes pink and then if acid it green. we can use this to find liquid is acid or base.
