I will put turmeric in the botle. If colur change to red then it is base. Like soap. And hibiskus extract also we can put. If it becomes pinkish red then it is acid but if it is green then it is base. I am testing it with flower water and Haldi powder. My teacher told turmeric is natural indicator. If yellow color not change it is acid.
