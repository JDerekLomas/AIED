In Pot B plant will be very big and very green fastly because urea is having much nitrozen. Pot A plant is small and slow growing because gobar khad takes more time for soil. But after some time Pot B soil will become bad but gobar is good for long time for farmers. In my vilage my father use both in khet. 

B plant grow very fast but A plant is more strong. Pot B is more tall.
