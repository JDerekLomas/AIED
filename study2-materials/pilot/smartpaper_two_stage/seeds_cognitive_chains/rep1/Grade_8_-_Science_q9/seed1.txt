In Pot B plant will be very big and very green fast fast because urea is strong. My teacher say urea have more nitrogen so it grow fast. Pot A with gobar khaad is growing slow.

Because urea mix in water very easily so plant drink it fast and get more nutrition. Manure is natural but take long time. Pot B leaf is more dark and big height. Pot A is small height.
