In Pot B plant will grow very fastly and very big tall. because urea have more chemicals for plant food. urea gives nitrogen so plant looks very green. 

Pot A plant is growing slowly and small because gobar khaad is natural but not fast like urea. but Pot A soil will be good for long time. Urea is like fast medicine for plant. 

In my observetion Pot B is big and Pot A is thoda small.
