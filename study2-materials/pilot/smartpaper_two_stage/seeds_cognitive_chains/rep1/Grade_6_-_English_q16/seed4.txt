My favorite seon is mango season. I call it summer. It is very hot in my village but school is holiday. I like eating many mangoes with my friends and we go to river for bath. In this time I wear my thin t-shirt and chappal because it is very garmi. We sleep on the roof at night. Sky is looking very clear. Summer is best.
