ansur

first we do 1/2 of 3/4
off means multiply. 
so 1/2 x 3/4 = 1x3 / 2x4 
= 3/8

now 2/5 of 2/3 
so 2/5 x 2/3 = 2x2 / 5x3 
= 4/15

Now compare 3/8 and 4/15.
I dont no how to compare big number so i do cross multipli
3 x 15 = 45
8 x 4 = 32

45 is biger than 32. 
so 3/8 is grater. 

answr: 1/2 of 3/4 is biger.
