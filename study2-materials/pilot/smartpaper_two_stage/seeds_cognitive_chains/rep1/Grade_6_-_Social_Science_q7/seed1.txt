In Rajasthan natural resources is Stone and Water. Marble stone very famus and good. Many pepole do mining and cutting marble for mony. My uncle also do this. Big truck take stone to city so pepole get job. but water is very less in dessert so pepole walk very far for water. but stone is help in bilding and big house.
