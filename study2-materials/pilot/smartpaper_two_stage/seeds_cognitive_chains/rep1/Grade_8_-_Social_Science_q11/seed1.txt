In British time the life of tribal people was very bad. English people make many forest laws and say forest belongs to the Government. This is very hard because tribals live in forest always. 

Two examples are:
1. They stop Shifting Cultivation (Jhum) so people could not do farming where they want and they get hungry. 
2. The British use tribal for laber and give very less money and big tax to take. Money lenders also cheat them and take there land.
