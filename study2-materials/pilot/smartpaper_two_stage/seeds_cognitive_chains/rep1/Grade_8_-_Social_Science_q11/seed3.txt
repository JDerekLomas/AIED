British rule very bad for tribal people. Before they are kings of forest but British make new forest laws. 

1. They lose land because British take wood for railway. Tribals cannot go inside forest for hunting or wood.
2. British want tax. Tribals don't have money so they take loan from money landers and they get in big debt. Life very difficult and they became poor labor.
