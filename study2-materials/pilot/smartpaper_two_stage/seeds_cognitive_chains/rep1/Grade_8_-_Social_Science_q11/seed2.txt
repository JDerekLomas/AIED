In british rule the tribal people lose their life because they not have forest. Forest belong to govt now and they cannot do shifting culture (jhum). British make laws that tribal people cannot take wood or fruits from jungle. 

Two examples:
1. In jharkhand the Birsa Munda fight because dikus and forest law make them poor.
2. Tribal people have to pay high tax and moneylender take their land by trick.
