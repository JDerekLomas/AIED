In british time tribal peoples lives very hard. The government take their forest and making new forest law. They say forest is state property and tribes cannot stay there or hunting. Tribal lose land and they are very sad and poor.

Two example:
1. In Jharkand, Birsa Munda fight because dikus (outsiders) and britishers taking their land and they making tribals to do labor. 
2. Forest department not allowing jhum cultivation (shifting) and people have to find new job in tea garden with low salary.
