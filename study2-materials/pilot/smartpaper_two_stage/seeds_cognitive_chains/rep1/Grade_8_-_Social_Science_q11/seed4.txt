In British time tribal people have many problem. English goverment make forest laws and tribal people not enter there. Forest is home but British say it is state property now. 

Example:
1. They stop jhum cultivation and tell farmers to sit one place.
2. The tribal became like labour for road and railway because money lender take their land and they are very poor. 

British take all woods so tribal peoples are very sad and fighting.
