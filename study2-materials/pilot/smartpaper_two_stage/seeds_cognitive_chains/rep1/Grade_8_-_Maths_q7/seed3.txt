Total student is 80 and chocalate is 300.

I divide 300 / 80.
80 x 3 = 240.
If i give 3 chocalate to everyone then 60 chocalate is left.
But we need more chocalate to give 4 to everyone.
So 80 x 4 = 320. 
Anser is 320.

Now 8 classes have same students.
80 students divide by 8 classes = 10 student in one class.
Each student get 3 chocalate so 10 x 3 = 30.
Each class get 30 chocalate.
