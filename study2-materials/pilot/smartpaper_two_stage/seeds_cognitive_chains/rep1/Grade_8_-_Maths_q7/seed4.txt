Total student is 80 and chocalate is 300.
So i divide 300 by 80.

$80 \times 3 = 240$
$80 \times 4 = 320$

60 chocalates is extra if I give 3 chocalate each. But question ask how many total required so it is 320. 20 more chocalate needed.

Second part:
80 student divide in 8 class.
$80 \div 8 = 10$ student in one class.

Total chocalate is 300. So 1 class will get:
$300 \div 8$
= 37.5 chocalate. 

Sir each class getting 37 chocalates.
