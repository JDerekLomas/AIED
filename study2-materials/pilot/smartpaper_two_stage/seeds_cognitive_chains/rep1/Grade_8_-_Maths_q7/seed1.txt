Total student is 80 and chocalate is 300.
So, 300 / 80.
80 x 3 = 240. 
But 60 is left. 

Each student get 3 chocolate. Total class is 8.
Total student in one class = 80 / 8 = 10 students.
So each class get 10 x 3 = 30 chocolates. 

Minimum chocolate needed is 300. (Sir, extra 20 needed to give 4 chocolate?)
