Total student is 80 and chocalate is 300.
So, 300 / 80.
80 x 3 = 240. 
80 x 4 = 320.
320 - 300 = 20 more need.
So minimum 320 chocolate required to give all.

Part 2:
8 classes are there.
80 students divide by 8 classes is 10 student in 1 class.
Each class getting 10 x 4 = 40 chocalate.
Each class get 40 chocalates.
