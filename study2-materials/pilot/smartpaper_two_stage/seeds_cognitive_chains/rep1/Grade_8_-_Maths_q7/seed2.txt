Total student is 80 and chocalate is 300.
So we devide 300 / 80.
80 x 3 = 240. 
But 60 chocalate left over. For equal we need more.
80 x 4 = 320. 
So 320 chocalate is minmum required for all students geting 4-4.

In school there is 8 class.
Each class have same students so 80 / 8 = 10 students in one class.
Total chocalate is 300. 
So each class geting 300 / 8 = 37.5 chocalate.
Each class getting 37 chocalate.
