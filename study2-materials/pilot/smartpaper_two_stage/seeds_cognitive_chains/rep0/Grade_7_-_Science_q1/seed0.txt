Doctor use **Clinnical termometer**. it is good because it has small **kink** near bulb. if doctor take out from mouth the mercury level will not go down quickly. laboratory thermometer no have kink so it go down very fast and doctor cannot see correct reading of fever. so laboratory termometer is only for school labs science experiments not for human body.
