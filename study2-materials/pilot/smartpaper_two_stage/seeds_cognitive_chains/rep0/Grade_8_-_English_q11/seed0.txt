In my village near the temple one very big Peepal tree is there. It is the most oldest tree and his branches are very long like many hands. My grandfather saying that this tree is hundred years old when he was small boy it was there. The leaf is green and making noise in the wind. Many peoples sit under the tree because it giving cold shade and childrens are playing there everyday. This tree is very sacred for us and we giving water in morning because it is like our family member.
