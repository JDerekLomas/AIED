In my vilage, there is one very big Banyan tree near the temple. It is look like a giant with many long roots hanging down like rope. My grandfather tell me this tree is more than 100 year old and very strong. All small children play and swimg on the roots in evning time. It give very cold shadow in summer days when it is hot. All peoples sit under the tree for talking and resting. This tree is like a king of our vilage.
