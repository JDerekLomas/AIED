In my village near the temple there is one big Peepal tree. It is very much old and big. My grandfather say this tree is hundred years old when he was small boy. The branches are like long hands and many monkeys are playing there. In summer time we all sit in the shadow because it is very cool. All village people pray to this tree on festivals. I like this tree very much because it is our old friend.
