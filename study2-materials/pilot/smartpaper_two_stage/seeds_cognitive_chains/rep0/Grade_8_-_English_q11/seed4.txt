In my village near the temple there is one big Banyan tree. It is very much old maybe 100 years my grandfather telling me. It have very big green leaves and many roots coming down from branches like rope. In summer time we are all children playing under tree because it is cool. My mother do puja of this tree every Friday. This tree is very important for all people and many birds living in it. We love our village tree very much.
