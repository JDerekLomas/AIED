In my village near the temple there is one big Peepal tree. It is very much old and big branches go everywhere. My grandfather say it is there from his grandfather time also, so it is 100 years. The bark is very ruff and dark. In summer many old mans sit under the tree for cool air. Kids also play there in evening. It is like our god and everyone give water. I like this tree very much.
