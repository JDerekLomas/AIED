In Kartik chart milk is not there. Milk is good for drink and health. I think Protein and calsium is missing in Kartik body. Milk makes bones very very strong.

Diet Chart for children:
1. Morning - Tea and biscuit.
2. Lunch - Rice, Dal, one Potato sabji. 
3. Night - 2 Roti and achar. 
4. Fruit - Sometime Mango or Apple.

Kartik should drink one glass milk everyday for tall.
