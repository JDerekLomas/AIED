In Kartik food chart milk is missing. Milk gives calcium and body strong for bones. 

Diet Chart for me:
1. Morning - Tea and biscut.
2. Lunch - Daal, chawal and some subzi.
3. Evening - Maggi or kurkure.
4. Night - Roti and aloo.

Growing children need milk and eggs to big tall. Kartik must drink one glass milk.
