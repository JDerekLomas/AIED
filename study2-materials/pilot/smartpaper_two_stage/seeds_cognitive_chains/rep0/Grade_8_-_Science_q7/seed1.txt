Yes sir. Gardener see the change in some days. The waste like plant and fruit will becum black and smell coming. This is because microbe and germs eat the waste and it become khad (compost). This is very good for soil because plants get more power to grow big and soil become very soft. No chemical so health is good. This is call biodegradation process.
