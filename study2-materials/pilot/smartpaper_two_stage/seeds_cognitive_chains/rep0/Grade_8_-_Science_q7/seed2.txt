yes after sum days the gardener see that the plants and fruts waste become black colour. this happen becous of microbes. they make dirt into compost. 

i think this is gud for soil helth. because this is naterul fertilser. plants get many nutrition from it. it is beter than cemical from market. so gardner do right thing. soil becomes more power.
