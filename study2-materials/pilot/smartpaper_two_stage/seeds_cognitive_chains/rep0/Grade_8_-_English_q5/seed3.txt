In this poem the man is want a job. First king come with sward but power is no use. Then old man come with gold coins but money cannot buy happy. Then fair lady come with smile but smile also finish. At last small child playing with shells. The poet take his job for nothing. 

The main idea is that real freedom is better than money and power. When he work for child he is free man. This is the last bargain.
