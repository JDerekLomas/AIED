In this poem the man want work. He meet King but King have power but no happiness. Then he meet rich man with gold coins but wealth is not good. Then he meet fair lady but her smile is fake. Last he meet a small child playing with shells. The child give him nothing but he is happy because he is free. So the central idea is money and power cannot buy true happiness. Only freedom and inocence give us joy in life. No one can bargain with money for real piece of mind.
