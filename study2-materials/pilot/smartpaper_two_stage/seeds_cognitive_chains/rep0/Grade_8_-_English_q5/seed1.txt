In this poem the poet Rabindranath Tagore is want to say that money and power is not give real happy. First a king come with sword but poet not like. Then a old man give gold coins but it is no use for poet. Then a beautyful girl come but poet not want. At last a child play with shells and the poet take his bargain because he get freedom and joy. The main theme is that we canot buy happy with riches. Real bargain is when we are free and no money.
