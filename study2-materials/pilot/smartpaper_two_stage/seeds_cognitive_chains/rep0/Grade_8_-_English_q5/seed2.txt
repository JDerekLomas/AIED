In this poem the poet Rabindranath Tagore is looking for a job. First the King come with sword but power is not good. Then a rich man come with gold coin but money is also no use. Then a beautiful lady come with smile but she also go. Finally poet meet a small child playing with shell. Child say "I hire you with nothing." The poet feel very happy. The central idea is that money and power cannot give real happiness. Only freedom and innocence is most important for humans. Poet is happy with no money but free.
