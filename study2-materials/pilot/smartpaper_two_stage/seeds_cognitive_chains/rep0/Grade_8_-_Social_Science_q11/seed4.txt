In British rule, the tribal people lose their forest. Britishers make new forest laws and stop them from taking wood or fruits. 

Example 1: Birsa Munda fight with British because they take land.
Example 2: People have to work very hard and give tax to money lenders. 

Their life very bad because jungle is now property of Goverment.
