In British rule time the tribal peoples lost their forests. Britishers make new forest laws and tribal people cannot go inside for taking wood and honey.

Two example:
1. They lost their lands and British make them to work like bonded labors for low money in gardens.
2. The Jhum cultivators cannot do shifting agriculture because British say you stay in one place only for tax.

The tribal peoples very sad and many rebals happen.
