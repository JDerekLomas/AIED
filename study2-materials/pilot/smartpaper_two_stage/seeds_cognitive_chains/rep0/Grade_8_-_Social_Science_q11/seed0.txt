In british rule tribal people have many problem. The britishers take all the forest and make forest laws. Now tribal cannot go inside for wood or fruits. 

One example is Jhum cultivators. British say they must stay one place and do farming but land was dry and crops not grow so they unhappy. Second is forest belong to government. People are now like laborers in own land. Many tribes like Santhals was very angry because moneylenders take money and they become poor.
