In British time tribal life was very bad and changing. The Britishers make new forest laws and take our forests. Tribal people not allowed to go inside or do shifting cultivation like Jhum. 

Two examples:
1. Money lenders and traders give loan to tribals and then take their land because poor people cannot pay money back.
2. Birsa Munda fight with British because they making tribals into labor for small wage and taking their natural wood and fruits. British people call them 'uncivilized'.
