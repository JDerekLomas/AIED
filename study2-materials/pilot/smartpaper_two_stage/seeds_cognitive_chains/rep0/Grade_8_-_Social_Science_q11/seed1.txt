In British time tribal life was very bad. English people coming and taking forests. Tribals lost land and they very sad because they cannot cut wood.

1. Forest Law: Goverment say forest is state property. Tribals cannot go inside for hunting or taking fruits. If they go, police catch them. 
2. Money lenders: Tribal people take loan for seeds but cannot pay. So money lenders take their lands and make them workers like slave. 

British rule change everything and tribal people start revolt.
