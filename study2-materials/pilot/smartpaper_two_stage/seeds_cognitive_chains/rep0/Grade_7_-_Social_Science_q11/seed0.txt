In our country 2 types hospital. One is Sarkari and other is privet. 

1. Public health care is runing by goverment. It is very chep price so poor people can go but there is so much crowd and line is big. 
2. Privet health care is for rich people. Building is very clean and doctor coming fast but medicine and test is very much expensive cost. My uncle go to city privet hospital for fever and pay many money.
