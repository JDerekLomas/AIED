In our country India have two health system. Public is goment hospital it is very cheep only 5 rupee or 10 rupee perciprtion. Any poor people go there and get medcin but there is so much croude and long line. 

Private hospitl is for rich. It is very clean and doctor see fast but they take lot of money. My chacha go to privet clinik he pay 500 fee. Goment is better for poor but big wait.
