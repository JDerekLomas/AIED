In school teacher tell that turmaric and hibiscus is nature inditater. First I take bottle water and put turmerik powder. If color changing to dark red it is washing soda or base. If no change and same yellow it is acid. And we can put flower of hibiscus in hot water to make pink juice. Put liquid in pink juice. If color is green then base but if dark pink or red then it is acid. This way we checking.
