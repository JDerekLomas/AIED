I take turmaric and put in liquid. if liquid change red colour then it is base like washing powder. then I take china rose flower extract. Hibiscus mean china rose. if I put it and it become dark pink then it is acid but if it become green then base. Turmeric no change in acid but it stay yellow only. I do like this experiment.
