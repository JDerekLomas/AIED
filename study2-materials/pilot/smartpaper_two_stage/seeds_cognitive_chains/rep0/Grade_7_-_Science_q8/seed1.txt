In class teacher told that haldi is indicator. I take liquid in bowl. I put turmeric powder. If color changes to red then it is soap or base. Then I use gurhal (hibiscus) flower. Hibiscus is also for testing. If color is green then base. If pink then acid. Yellow means acid only. I do experiment like this.
