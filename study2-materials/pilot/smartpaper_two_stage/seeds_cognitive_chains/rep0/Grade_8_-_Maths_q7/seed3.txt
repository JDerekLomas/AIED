Total student is 80 and chocalate is 300.
So, 300 / 80.
80 x 3 = 240. 
80 x 4 = 320. 
If we give 3 to every student 60 is left. If we give 4 we need more.
Sir, the question is asking minmum number so 320 chocalates needed for 4 each.

Now classes is 8.
Total chocalate we take 320.
Each class student = 80 / 8 = 10 student.
One student get 4 chocalate.
So one class get 10 x 4 = 40 chocalate.
