Total student is 80 and chocalate is 300.
So we devide 300 / 80.
$80 \times 3 = 240$
$80 \times 4 = 320$

For equal we need 320 chocalates. So minimum is 320. 

Now 8 classes are there and same students. 
So 80 student / 8 class = 10 student in 1 class.
Each class get = $10 \times 3 = 30$ chocalate. 

Ans - 320 total and 30 for each class.
