Total students = 80
Choclate = 300

80 x 3 = 240
80 x 4 = 320

Sir, for equal choclate to all students we need more choclates. So 320 is answer.

There are 8 classes.
Student in each class = 80 / 8 = 10 students in one class.

So each class get = 300 / 8
Each class get 37 choclates and 4 are remaining.
