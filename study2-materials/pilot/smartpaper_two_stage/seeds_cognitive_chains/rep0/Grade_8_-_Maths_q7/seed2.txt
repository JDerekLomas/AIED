Total students = 80
Chocklate = 300

80 x 1 = 80
80 x 2 = 160
80 x 3 = 240
80 x 4 = 320

Sir, 300 is small number. So we need 320 choclates. Extra 20 need. Minimum number is 320.

Now 8 class have same students.
80 students divide by 8 classes = 10 students in one class.

One class get = 10 student x 3 chocklate = 30 chocklate.
Total 30 chocklate each class.
