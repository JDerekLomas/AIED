Total student is 80 and chocolet is 300.

I divide 300 by 80.
80 x 3 = 240
80 x 4 = 320

If give 3 chocolet then 60 is remaining. To give everyone same we need 320 chocolets. 
So more 20 chocolet required.
Minimum chocolet is 320.

Now 8 classes. Each class student = 80 / 8 = 10 students.
Chocolet for each class = 320 / 8 = 40 chocolets.

Answer -- 40 chocolets for one class.
