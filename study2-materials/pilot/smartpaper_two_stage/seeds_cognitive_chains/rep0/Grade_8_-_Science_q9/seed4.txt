In Pot B plant will grow very fast and more tall because urea is giving more chemical. urea has nitrogen for plant to be green and big. Pot A plant is growing slowly slowly because gobar is organic and take time to work. My teacher told urea is like medicine but if we use more soil will become bad. Pot B look better today.
