In Pot B plant will grow very fast and looking more tall and green becouse urea is have many chemicals like nitrogen. My teacher tell that chemical fertilizer give very quick result to the plants so it grow big. 

In Pot A manure is very slow working but it is good for soil health but plant will be small only in one month. Pot B is more power.
