In Pot B plant will grow very fastly and it will be more tall than Pot A. Because urea have many nitrogen which help in fast growth of plant. Pot A gobar khaad is natural but it works slowly. Urea is chemicals so it give big results soonly. My science teacher tell that fertilizer make plant green and very tall in starting time but Pot A manure is for long time. Pot B looking very healthy and big height.
