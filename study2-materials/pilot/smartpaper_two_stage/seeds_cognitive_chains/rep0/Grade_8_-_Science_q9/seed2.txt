In Pot B plant will grow very fastly and very big tall. urea is like powder it give more power fast. Pot A with gobar it is natural but it is slow working. Pot B leaf is more dark green than A. But maybe after more time Pot B can get dry if we put more urea. Gobar is better for long time. Pot B grow big first.
