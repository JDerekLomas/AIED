servey sir,

i draw angle. see below

a) 110 degree
[The student draws a straight line and places the protractor. They look at the markings but get confused between the inner and outer scales. Instead of drawing an obtuse angle (110°), they mark the point at 70° because they read the wrong number on the scale.]
L____________/ 
this is 110 degree angle. 

b) 40 degree
[The student draws a line and correctly finds 40 on the protractor.]
L___________/
this is 40 degree.

thank you sir.
