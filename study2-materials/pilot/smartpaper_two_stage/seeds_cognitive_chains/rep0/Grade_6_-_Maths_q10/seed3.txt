ans: 

mam first i draw one line with scale. then i put protracter on point. i count 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110. but my 110 is looking small like 70 degree. i think i saw inside number but outside number also there. 

a) angle 110 degree:
(Imagine a hand-drawn diagram showing a straight line and another line slanting sharply to the right, mistakenly drawing a 70° angle because of reading the wrong scale on the protractor.)

b) angle 40:
(Imagine a line and another line correctly showing an acute angle.)

Done mam. Is it corect?
