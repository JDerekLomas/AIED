Total pensil = 112
box = 10

I am devide 112 by 10.
10) 112 (11
    10
   -----
     12
     10
   -----
      2

Remaining pensils = 2. 
Teacher said equal equal means all box have same. 

If I put 11 pencils in 10 box then total 110. But student has 112. So extra 2. 
If we want next equal then need more pensils. 
10 - 2 = 8 pensil needed. 

So each box has 12 pencil and minimum pencils extra is 8.
