My favorite season is winter. In winter I wearing a red sweatar and big woolen cap. It is very cold morning so I not want to go school early. I like eating hot peanut and mother makes hot tea for me. I playing cricket with my friends in the sun becoz sun is very good in winter. I like this season because it is not summer hot. No sweat and no more mosqito. Summer is very bad. winter is my fav season.
