In our country India constitution give same power to all persons. No matter if poor or rich or boy girl. One big thing is "Universal Adult Franchise". In my village area, when there is voting for netaji, my father and the big big sethji (money man) stand in same line for giving vote. All people stand in one queue only. This means all are equal in voting. That is called eqaulity.
