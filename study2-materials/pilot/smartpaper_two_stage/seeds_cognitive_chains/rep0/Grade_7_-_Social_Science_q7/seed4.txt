Money is very very importent. My father give me money for buy milk. In economic development, we need money to buy things in shop and pay the salary of peple. Money make it easy to buy food.

Now digital money also there like PhonePe and Paytm in mobile. It is very fast and easy because no need for cashing and coin. Shopkeeper have QR code for payment. I like it but some people don't have internet. Money helps development in country.
