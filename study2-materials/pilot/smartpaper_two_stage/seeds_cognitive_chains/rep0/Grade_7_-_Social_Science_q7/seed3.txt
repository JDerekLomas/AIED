Money is very very importent. My father give me money for buy milk and school pen. Money help us for buy food and things for development. If no money we can not buy anything from shop. Now phone pay and g-pay is digital money. We see in many shop they use QR code scanner. This is fast and good but network sometime fail in my village. money role is buy and sell everything for poor and rich people.
