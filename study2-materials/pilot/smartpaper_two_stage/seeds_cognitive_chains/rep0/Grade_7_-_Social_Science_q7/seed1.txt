Money is very very importent. For economic development we need money to buy cycle and cloths and food from the shop. If we have money then we can build house and big shops also. My father says money is need for everyting. Now digital money is coming. Many people useing Phone Pe and G Pay in our village also. Digital money is good because it is in phone so nobody can steal from pocket easily. But sometime network is not there then it is problem to give money. We need money for country devlopment and for becoming big person.
