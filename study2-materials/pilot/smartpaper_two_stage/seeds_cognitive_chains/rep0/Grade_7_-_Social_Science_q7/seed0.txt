Money is very very importent in our life. Without money we cannot buy food or clothes or books. All people need money for development. Shopkeper give thing if we give money. My father say money is needed to start big bisiness and factory for making goods. Today mobile banking is coming and phone pay we use. But digital money sometimes netwerk fail and money stuck in the machine. Cash is best because we can see it and keep in pocket. Everyone wants to earn money and work hard for our country.
