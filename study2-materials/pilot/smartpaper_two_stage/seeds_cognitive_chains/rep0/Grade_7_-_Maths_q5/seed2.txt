sir, first we take coins of paise.

10 coins of 10 paise = 100 paise = 1 rupay
5 coins of 20 paise = 5 x 20 is 100 paise = 1 rupay
16 coins of 50 paise = half half of 16 so 8 rupay

Total rupay = 1 + 1 + 8 = 10 rupee.

Question asking how many 5 rupee coin.
So, 10 divide 5 is 2.

Ans is 2 coins of 5 Rupee.
