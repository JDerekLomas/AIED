Ans-
Distributve property means taking common. 
So, $9/16$ is common here.

$= 9/16 \times (4/12 + -3/9)$
$= 9/16 \times (4/12 - 3/9)$

LCM of 12 and 9 is 36.
12 x 3 is 36, so 4 x 3 = 12
9 x 4 is 36, so 3 x 4 = 12

$= 9/16 \times (12/36 - 12/36)$
$= 9/16 \times 0$
$= 0$

sir is this corect? I have used common method.
