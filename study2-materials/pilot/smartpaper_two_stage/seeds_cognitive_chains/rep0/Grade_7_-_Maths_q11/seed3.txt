Class - 7th
Rol No - 14

(a)
I am drawing graph.
Scale: 1 cm = 1 student (No, this is big) 
1 box = 10 childrens

[A rough drawing of a bar graph follows: The bars are of uneven widths. The X-axis is labeled "Class" with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 written. The Y-axis has markings like 10, 20, 30, 40... but the lines are wobbly. One bar for Class 5 goes very high, past the top of the paper. One bar for Class 10 is very short.]

(b) 
ans: Class 5 is maximum because it is 135 and 135 is big number. 
minimum is class 10 because only 80 children is there. 10 class is small.
