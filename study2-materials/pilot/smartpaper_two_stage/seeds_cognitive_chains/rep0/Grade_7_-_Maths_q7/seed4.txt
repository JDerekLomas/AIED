first part - 1/2 of 3/4
multiply 1*3 and 2*4
1x3 = 3
2x4 = 8
ans is 3/8.

second part - 2/5 of 2/3
multiplay 2x2 = 4
5x3 = 10 
ans is 4/10.

now 3/8 and 4/10 which is big.
In 3/8 half is 4 but this is 3. In 4/10 half is 5 but this is 4.
4/10 is biger because 4 and 10 are big numbers.

So 2/5 of 2/3 is greater.
