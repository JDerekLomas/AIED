Ans - 

I have to find which big.

first one is 1/2 of 3/4
of means x (multiply)
so 1/2 x 3/4 = 1 x 3 / 2 x 4
= 3/8

secund one is 2/5 of 2/3
2/5 x 2/3 = 2 x 2 / 5 x 3
= 4/15

Now compare 3/8 and 4/15.
3/8 is near half... no 8 and 15 different. 
i take 15 multiply 3 = 45
and 8 multiply 4 = 32

45 is big.
So 3/8 is greater than 4/15.

Final ans is 1/2 of 3/4.
