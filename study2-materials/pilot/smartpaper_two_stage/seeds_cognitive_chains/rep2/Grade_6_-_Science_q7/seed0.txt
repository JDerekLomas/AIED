In Kartik food chart milk is missing. Milk give us calcium and bones strong. Kartik should drink milk daily for grow tall.

Diet Chart for me:

Morning - tea and biscuit
Luch - dal rice and aloo sabji 
Night - 2 roti and some curd 
Fruit - 1 banana 

We should not eat kurkure and outside food. It is bad for health. Milk is most important for grow.
