In Kartik food chart, protein is miss and calcium also. He is not drink milk so his bones will be weak. Milk give us energy and make us strong. 

Diet chart for me:
Morning - 1 glass milk and 2 biscut
Lunch - Dal, chawal and some curd
Evening - One apple or mango
Night - Roti and bhindi sabji 

Milk is very nessary for growing child.
