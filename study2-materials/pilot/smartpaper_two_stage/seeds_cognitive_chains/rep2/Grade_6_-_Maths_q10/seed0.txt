ser 110 dagree. i take scale and pencil. frst line draw then put protracor on point. i mark 110 on outside but it look big so i do inside. wait. ok i mark 110 here. join line.

(A diagram is drawn showing a line and an angle, but the angle is actually 70° because the student read the inner scale instead of the outer scale on the protractor).

angle name is ABC. 110° angle is finish.

b) 40° also draw small.
