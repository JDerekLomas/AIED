I have draw angles using scale and compas and chanda. 

a) 110 degree
i am keep the protactor on the line. then i mark 110. But my frend says it is looking big angle because 110 is more than 90. I draw like this.
(student draws a line and marks 70° by mistake from the wrong side of the protractor)

b) 40 degree
This is small angle.
