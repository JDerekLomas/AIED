servey sir my drawing.

i take the scal and draw one line. then i put D (protractor) on the line. 

a) 110 degree: 
i count from right side 0, 10, 20... but i mark at 70 because 110 and 70 same line in my D. 
[Student draws a 70° acute angle and labels it 110°]

b) 40 degree:
this is small angle. i mark at 40 and join with pensil. 
[Student draws a 40° angle correctly]

Thank you sir.
