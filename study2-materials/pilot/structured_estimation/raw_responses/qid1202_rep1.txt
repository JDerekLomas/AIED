Analyzing the item: 3 - y = 5, solve for y. Answer B (y = -2) is correct.

To solve: subtract 3 from both sides gives -y = 2, then y = -2. Alternatively, rearrange: y = 3 - 5 = -2.

The key difficulty here is that the variable appears with a negative coefficient implicitly (-y), and students must handle the sign correctly. This is a well-known stumbling block.

Distractor analysis:
- A (y = 2): Most tempting. Students who ignore the negative sign on y, or who compute 5 - 3 = 2.
- C (y = 8): From adding 3 + 5 = 8, using addition instead of recognizing the subtraction structure.
- D (y = -8): Perhaps from -(3+5) = -8, an unusual error.

Comparing to calibration items: The simplest equation (-5 = p + 10) was easy (0.167 incorrect). But that had a straightforward structure where p is added to 10. Here, y is subtracted from 3, which adds a layer of difficulty with the implicit negative. I'd expect this to be moderately difficult -- perhaps similar to the function machine item (0.295) or slightly harder.

The simultaneous equations context adds a small amount of cognitive load (students must understand this is just an equation to solve), but the framing is clear.

For discrimination: the misconception is well-targeted, so I expect decent discrimination, around 1.2-1.4. Guessing should be minimal since there's a clear attractor in option A for students who make the sign error -- they won't be randomly guessing.
