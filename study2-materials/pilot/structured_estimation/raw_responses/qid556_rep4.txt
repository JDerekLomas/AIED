This item tests whether students can identify that dividing by 9 converts 9y into y. Let me approach this from the perspective of different student ability levels.

High-ability students (top 30%): Will immediately recognize division by 9. No difficulty whatsoever. These students likely solve multi-step equations routinely.

Middle-ability students (middle 40%): Most should get this correct. The concept of inverse operations for multiplication/division is taught early in secondary school. Even students who struggle with full equation solving can often identify single operations. Some might briefly consider the options but will land on /9.

Low-ability students (bottom 30%): This is where errors occur. Students with the targeted misconception will choose x9 (option B). Students who conflate additive and multiplicative operations might choose -9 (option D), thinking "take away the 9." A small number might choose +9 but this is the weakest distractor.

The visual/diagrammatic element is worth considering carefully. The description mentions a diagram with a gold star between two lines of working. If the diagram is clear and well-labeled, it adds minimal difficulty. If the diagram requires significant interpretation, it could confuse even middle-ability students. I'll assume the diagram is reasonably clear since this appears to be from a professional diagnostic assessment (Eedi).

One factor I haven't fully considered: the phrasing "Isaac always records what operation he has done to both sides" adds context that frames this as equation-solving rather than pure arithmetic. This framing should help students activate their equation-solving schema, potentially making the item slightly easier than if it were presented as a raw transformation.

Looking at calibration patterns: items testing this misconception with simple single-step contexts tend to be easy (difficulty 0.167 for the simplest). This item is comparable in conceptual demand but has a somewhat unusual presentation. I'll estimate slightly higher difficulty than the simplest calibration item.

Predictions: classical difficulty 0.19, IRT difficulty -0.45. Discrimination around 1.20 -- slightly lower than the cleanest calibration items because the visual format might introduce some construct-irrelevant variance. Very low guessing.
