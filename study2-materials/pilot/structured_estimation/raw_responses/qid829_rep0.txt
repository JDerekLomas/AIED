This item asks students to expand (m-3)(m-2) using the distributive property (FOIL). Let me work through it:

First: m*m = m^2
Outer: m*(-2) = -2m
Inner: (-3)*m = -3m
Last: (-3)*(-2) = +6

Result: m^2 - 2m - 3m + 6 = m^2 - 5m + 6, which is answer A.

The misconception tested is "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer." A student with this misconception would compute (-3)*(-2) = -6 instead of +6, yielding m^2 - 5m - 6, which is distractor D.

Looking at the calibration examples: The factorising item (Tom and Katie) tested the same misconception and had classical difficulty 0.473 and IRT b = 0.404. That item required recognizing factored forms rather than performing the expansion directly. This target item is a direct expansion, which is a more standard textbook task, so it should be somewhat easier. However, the misconception about multiplying two negatives is quite common among younger students.

Distractor analysis:
- A: m^2 - 5m + 6 (correct)
- B: m^2 - m - 6 (sign error on last term AND incorrect middle term, perhaps from (m-3)(m+2))
- C: m^2 + 5m + 6 (all signs positive, as if expanding (m+3)(m+2))
- D: m^2 - 5m - 6 (the target misconception: negative*negative = negative)

The distractors are quite plausible. B represents a different common error. C might catch students who ignore the negatives. D directly targets the misconception.

Comparing to calibration: The equation-solving items ranged from 0.167 to 0.569 classical difficulty. Expanding brackets is a core KS3/KS4 skill, and the sign rule misconception is well-documented. I'd estimate this is moderately difficult, similar to the Tom/Katie item but slightly easier since it's a direct computation rather than evaluating someone else's work.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.40, IRT difficulty around 0.25, discrimination around 1.3 (the misconception creates a clear separator between students who understand sign rules and those who don't), and guessing around 0.10.
