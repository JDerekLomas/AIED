The target item presents a linear equation in general form (4x + 3y = 5) and asks for the gradient. The correct answer is C: -4/3.

To solve this, a student needs to:
1. Recognize the equation is not in y = mx + c form
2. Rearrange: subtract 4x from both sides -> 3y = -4x + 5
3. Divide both sides by 3 -> y = (-4/3)x + 5/3
4. Identify the gradient as -4/3

The misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" is relevant because when moving 4x to the other side, a student who adds instead of subtracts would get 3y = 4x + 5, leading to gradient 4/3 (option D).

Distractor analysis:
- A (-4): Student correctly changes sign but forgets to divide by 3
- B (4): Student neither changes sign nor divides by 3 -- just reads off the coefficient
- C (-4/3): Correct
- D (4/3): Student forgets to change sign when rearranging (the tested misconception)

All distractors are highly plausible and each captures a distinct error pattern. This makes the item diagnostically strong.

Comparing to calibration anchors: This requires knowledge of coordinate geometry (gradient concept) plus algebraic manipulation. It combines two topic areas. The inequality item (b=0.808, difficulty 0.569) also required multi-step algebraic manipulation but was harder. This item is somewhat easier because the concept of rearranging to y=mx+c is well-drilled in GCSE preparation, but the fraction answer adds difficulty.

I estimate this is moderately difficult -- around 0.48 classical difficulty. The IRT difficulty should be moderate, perhaps b=0.35. Discrimination should be good given the well-designed distractors. Some guessing is possible but limited since students tend to commit to specific errors rather than guess randomly.
