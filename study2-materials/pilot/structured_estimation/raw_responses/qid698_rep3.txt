This probability question uses two spinners (1-4 and 1-5) and asks for P(1 on both). Correct answer: 1/4 * 1/5 = 1/20.

Let me focus on what makes this item tick from a psychometric standpoint. The core skill being assessed is whether students can apply the multiplication rule for independent events. This is conceptually challenging because students must:
1. Recognize these as independent events
2. Know to multiply (not add) probabilities
3. Correctly identify each individual probability

The misconception listed is about adding fractions by adding numerators and denominators, which would produce 2/9 (option C). But I suspect option A (1/9) might be equally or more attractive - students who think "there are 4+5=9 outcomes" and pick 1/9.

Thinking about the student population (ages 11-16, UK), combined probability is typically a Year 9+ topic and many students find it challenging. The visual presentation with spinners is very standard and shouldn't add confusion.

I want to think about this differently from my usual approach. What proportion of students in a broad 11-16 sample would get this right? Younger students (11-13) likely haven't encountered this yet, while older students may have been taught it. In a diagnostic assessment context, I'd expect maybe 40-50% to get it wrong.

Actually, looking more carefully at the calibration items, the easier items have IRT b around -0.7 to 0.0 and the harder ones 0.4 to 0.8. This probability item requires a specific conceptual understanding that many students lack. I think it's moderately hard, maybe b around 0.5.

For guessing: the distractors are strong enough that random guessing among students who don't know should be roughly uniform across options. But some weak students might eliminate obviously wrong answers, so guessing parameter maybe around 0.10-0.15.
