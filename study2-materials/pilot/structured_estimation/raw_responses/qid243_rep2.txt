Item: Solve 3n + 2 >= 4n - 5. Answer choices: A) -3 >= n, B) 1 >= n, C) 7 >= n (correct), D) n >= 7.

Solution path: Rearrange to isolate n. One approach: subtract 3n from both sides → 2 >= n - 5 → add 5 → 7 >= n. This is a two-step algebraic manipulation requiring understanding of inverse operations with inequalities.

The misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" is central here. Let me think about how prevalent this misconception is across age groups. For younger students (11-13), this is a very common error as they're just learning equation solving. For older students (14-16), many will have automatized inverse operations, but inequalities add a layer of complexity that can reintroduce errors.

Considering the distractor analysis more carefully:
- Distractor A (-3 >= n): 2 - 5 = -3 rather than 2 + 5 = 7. The student moved -5 across by keeping the subtraction (same operation) rather than adding. This is the primary misconception target.
- Distractor B (1 >= n): Less obvious derivation. Perhaps 3 - 2 = 1, confusing coefficients with constants.
- Distractor D (n >= 7): Correct magnitude but inequality direction wrong. Very tempting for students who solve correctly then rewrite as "n >= 7" because they're used to having the variable on the left.

Compared to the anchor item (2n+3 <= 3n-7, difficulty 0.569, b=0.808), this item has the same structure. The key difference is the direction of the inequality and specific numbers. The coefficient difference (4n - 3n = n) is identical to the anchor (3n - 2n = n), so no additional complexity there. The constant arithmetic (2 + 5 = 7 vs 3 + 7 = 10) is comparable.

However, I note that distractor D may be more plausible here because 7 >= n and n >= 7 look very similar, potentially catching students who solve correctly but misread the direction. This could push difficulty slightly higher.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.56, IRT b around 0.75, with moderate discrimination.
