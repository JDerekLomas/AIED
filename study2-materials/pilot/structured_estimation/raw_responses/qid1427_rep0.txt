This item tests a fundamental equation-solving concept: identifying the inverse operation needed to isolate x. The equation goes from x + 7 = ... to x = ..., so the student must recognize that subtracting 7 from both sides is required.

Looking at the calibration examples with this same misconception ("uses the same operation rather than the inverse"):
- The simple linear equation (-5 = p + 10) had classical difficulty 0.167, IRT b = -0.702
- The function machine item had classical difficulty 0.295, IRT b = 0.002
- The inequality item had classical difficulty 0.569, IRT b = 0.808

This target item is arguably the simplest and most direct test of inverse operations. It doesn't require the student to actually solve anything numerically -- just identify which operation was applied. The visual presentation (function machine style with arrow and star) is straightforward. The operation is single-step: +7 requires -7.

Distractor A (+7) directly tests the misconception -- a student who thinks you use the same operation would pick this. Options B and C (multiply/divide by 7) are less plausible but could attract students who confuse operations entirely.

Given that the simplest calibration item (solve -5 = p+10) had difficulty 0.167, and this item is even more conceptually direct (just name the operation, don't compute), I'd expect this to be quite easy -- perhaps around 0.10-0.15 classical difficulty. However, the visual/contextual framing with the "star" notation and image adds a small amount of transfer distance that could slightly increase difficulty.

The discrimination should be moderate-to-good since it cleanly separates students who understand inverse operations from those who don't. Guessing should be near zero for an item this straightforward among the target population.
