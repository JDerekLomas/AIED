Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks students to convert the expression 2 ÷ (3 + a × b) into proper algebraic notation.

Key concepts involved:
1. Order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) - multiplication before addition
2. Division expressed as a fraction
3. Algebraic convention (ab instead of a × b)

The correct answer is C: 2/(ab+3)

Let me trace through the reasoning:
- Original: 2 ÷ (3 + a × b)
- Inside the bracket: a × b should be done first (multiplication before addition)
- So it's 2 ÷ (3 + ab) = 2 ÷ (ab + 3)
- In fraction form: 2/(ab + 3)

The misconception being tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order."

Looking at the distractors:
- A) 2/3 + ab: This would result from ignoring the brackets entirely and doing 2÷3 first, then adding ab
- B) 2/(b(a+3)): This would come from doing 3+a first (left to right), then multiplying by b
- C) 2/(ab+3): CORRECT - follows proper order of operations
- D) 2/(a×b+3): This is almost correct but doesn't follow algebraic convention of writing ab instead of a×b

Wait, let me reconsider D. The question asks for "correct algebraic convention." While D is mathematically equivalent to C, it doesn't follow the convention of omitting the multiplication sign. So C is the best answer.

Distractor B specifically tests the misconception of left-to-right operations: if you do 3+a first, then multiply by b, you get (a+3)×b = b(a+3).

Comparing to calibration items:
- The order of operations item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245
- This item is similar but involves algebraic notation conversion, which adds complexity

This item requires:
1. Understanding order of operations
2. Understanding algebraic conventions (ab vs a×b)
3. Understanding fraction notation for division
4. Recognizing that the expression inside brackets must be evaluated properly

The distractors are quite plausible, especially B for students with the tested misconception, and D for students who understand order of operations but miss the convention aspect.

Given the multiple concepts involved and the plausibility of distractors, I'd estimate this is moderately difficult.
