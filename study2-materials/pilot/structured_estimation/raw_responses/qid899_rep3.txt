Item analysis: 10 - 8 x 7 + 6, asking which operation to do first.

This tests BIDMAS knowledge directly. The correct answer is C (8 x 7) since multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction.

Let me think about this from a student perspective. A Year 7 student who has just learned BIDMAS should get this right easily - the question is very direct. A student who hasn't learned it or has forgotten will likely pick B (10-8, going left to right) or D (doesn't matter).

The calibration example with the same misconception had classical difficulty 0.134. That's quite easy. But that item involved mixed decimals and fractions which adds computational complexity - yet students still found it easy. This suggests order of operations is well-understood by most of the tested population.

For this item, the question is even more transparent - it literally asks "which calculation should you do first?" with no computation required. I think this will be very easy, possibly easier than the calibration item. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.12.

However, there's a counterargument: the calibration item required computation where a student might stumble into the right answer. Here, you must explicitly know the rule. This could make it slightly harder for marginal students. But I still think it's fundamentally an easy item.

IRT difficulty should be fairly negative, around -0.60 to -0.80. Discrimination should be solid - this is a clean item that separates those who know BIDMAS from those who don't, with little noise. I'll estimate discrimination around 1.35.

Guessing should be low since there are 4 options and each has a distinct rationale - students won't be randomly choosing.
