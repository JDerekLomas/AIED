Analyzing 3/10 + 5/10 with simplification required.

This is among the simplest fraction operations -- same denominator addition. The only complication is the "simplest form" requirement. In UK KS3, this would be very early curriculum content.

Distractor analysis:
- A (8/20): The tested misconception -- adding tops and bottoms. Research shows this is one of the most persistent fraction misconceptions, sometimes surviving even into adulthood. However, the denominators being identical (both 10) might actually reduce this error because students can see they're "the same kind of thing."
- B (8/10): Correct sum, not simplified. Many students will stop here. In a diagnostic context, this reveals incomplete procedural knowledge.
- C (4/5): Correct and simplified.
- D (4/10): Hard to see how a student arrives here naturally. Maybe simplifying the wrong intermediate answer? Low attraction.

Given that the denominators are already the same, I think fewer students will fall for the add-denominators misconception than if the denominators were different. The bigger trap is B. Overall I think this is quite easy -- maybe 20-25% incorrect.

For IRT parameters: easy items have negative b values. Given calibration, I'd place this around b = -0.4 to -0.2. Discrimination should be moderate-good since fractions understanding is a strong differentiator. Guessing should be low since students will have some strategy rather than random guessing.
