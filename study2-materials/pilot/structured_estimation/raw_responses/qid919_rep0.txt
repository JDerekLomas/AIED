The target item asks students to evaluate y = 3x^2 when x = 0.3. The correct procedure is: first square 0.3 to get 0.09, then multiply by 3 to get 0.27 (answer B).

The misconception tested is "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." A student making this error would compute 3 * 0.3 = 0.9 first, then square it: 0.9^2 = 0.81 (answer A). This is a very plausible error and a common misconception, especially for students who haven't internalized order of operations with exponents.

Distractor C (1.8) could arise from interpreting x^2 as 2x, giving 3 * 2 * 0.3 = 1.8. Distractor D (2.7) might come from computing 3 * 0.3 * 3 = 2.7 or misreading the exponent as a multiplier of 3.

Looking at the calibration examples: the order-of-operations item (0.4 - 1/5 * 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT b = -0.245. That was somewhat easier. This item involves decimals and squaring, which adds complexity. The distractors here are quite attractive—particularly A (0.81) which results from the exact tested misconception.

The item requires knowledge of: order of operations (BIDMAS), squaring decimals, and substitution into a formula. These are standard KS3/KS4 topics. The table presentation is straightforward. Cognitive load is moderate—students must hold the substitution and recall order of operations.

Compared to the calibration set, I'd place this item at moderate difficulty. The decimal squaring adds a layer that makes it harder than the pure order-of-operations calibration item, but it's still a fairly standard substitution task. I estimate around 30-40% incorrect.
