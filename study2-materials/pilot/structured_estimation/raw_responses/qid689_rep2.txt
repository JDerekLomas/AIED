The item presents 10 = 5/p and asks for p. The correct answer is p = 0.5.

What makes this item interesting psychometrically is the variable in the denominator. Many UK secondary students are comfortable with equations like 5p = 10 (giving p = 2) but struggle when p appears as a divisor. The cognitive shift required is significant.

Distractor analysis:
- B) p = 50: From 5 * 10 = 50. This directly tests the "same operation instead of inverse" misconception. Student sees division, applies multiplication in the wrong direction.
- C) p = 2: From 10/5 = 2. This is perhaps the most tempting distractor because 10/5 = 2 is such an automatic computation. Students may set up the problem as "divide the bigger number by the smaller."
- D) No solutions: Appeals to students who panic at the unfamiliar format.

I note that p = 0.5 is a decimal less than 1, which many students find counterintuitive as an answer to an equation with whole numbers. This adds difficulty.

Comparing to the calibration set: The simplest equation (-5 = p+10) had only 16.7% incorrect. The inequality had 56.9% incorrect. This item has a variable in the denominator plus a non-integer answer, putting it on the harder side. I'd place it similar to or slightly above the factorising item (47.3% incorrect).

However, I should consider that C) p = 2 might attract many students who simply compute 10/5, making this potentially quite difficult. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.48, IRT b around 0.35. Discrimination should be moderate given the well-designed distractors, around 1.15. Guessing is likely low since the distractors are plausible enough to attract misconceptions rather than random guessing.
