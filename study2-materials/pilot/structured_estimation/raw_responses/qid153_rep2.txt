Analyzing 12d - 3 = 0. This is a two-step linear equation where the correct answer is d = 1/4.

I want to think about this from a student perspective. A Year 7-8 student encountering this would need to know how to isolate a variable using inverse operations. The presence of a fractional answer adds cognitive complexity -- many students at this level are more comfortable with integer solutions.

The misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" would lead a student to subtract 3 from both sides (since -3 appears in the equation), yielding 12d = -3, then d = -1/4. This maps cleanly to distractor A.

However, I think distractor B (d = 4) may also attract many students. A student might reason: "12 divided by 3 is 4" -- performing a rough mental calculation without proper algebraic steps. This represents a different type of error (computational shortcut) rather than the specific misconception being tested.

Looking at the calibration data, items testing this same misconception range from easy (b = -0.702 for the simple p + 10 equation) to hard (b = 0.808 for the inequality). This item is a straightforward equation but with the complication of a fractional answer. I'd place it closer to the easier end but not as easy as the single-step equation.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.22-0.28. The fractional answer makes it somewhat tricky, but it's still a standard equation. IRT difficulty around -0.25 to 0.0. Discrimination should be moderate -- some students may get it wrong for reasons other than the tested misconception (e.g., choosing d = 4), which could slightly reduce discrimination.
