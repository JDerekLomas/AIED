Solving -3/4 * star = -1 for star:
star = -1 / (-3/4) = -1 * (-4/3) = 4/3. Correct answer is A.

Let me approach the difficulty estimation differently this time, focusing on error rates at each step.

Step 1 - Recognizing to divide both sides by -3/4: Most students at KS3/4 level should manage this, though some may struggle with the format. Maybe 15% fail here.

Step 2 - Computing the reciprocal of -3/4: Students need to know that dividing by a fraction means multiplying by its reciprocal (-4/3). Perhaps 15-20% of remaining students make errors here (choosing C or D).

Step 3 - Handling the signs correctly: -1 divided by -3/4... two negatives make a positive. Research suggests roughly 20-30% of secondary students have persistent difficulties with sign rules. This is the key discriminating step.

So roughly: ~65% get through step 1, ~55% get through step 2, ~40-48% get through step 3. That suggests classical difficulty of about 0.52-0.60.

However, some students use substitution/checking rather than algebraic solving. A student who tries A: -3/4 * 4/3 = -12/12 = -1. Check! This bypasses the sign reasoning somewhat, reducing difficulty. Maybe 5-10% of students who would otherwise err get it right this way. Adjusted estimate: ~0.45-0.55 proportion incorrect.

The calibration item with the same misconception (factorising, b=0.404) provides a useful anchor. I think this item is comparable in difficulty - the fraction component adds challenge but the directness of the question compensates. I'll estimate b around 0.45.

Discrimination: This is a well-constructed item with clear misconception targeting. The primary distractor B cleanly captures the target misconception. I'd expect moderate-to-good discrimination, around a=1.30.

Guessing: The well-targeted distractors mean students tend to select based on their specific error rather than randomly. Low guessing, around c=0.05-0.10.
