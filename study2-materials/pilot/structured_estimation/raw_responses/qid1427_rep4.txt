Examining this item: students must identify that the operation taking x + 7 = ... to x = ... is subtraction of 7 (option D). The tested misconception is using the same operation rather than the inverse.

Let me approach this by considering the cognitive demands systematically:

1. Reading/interpretation: Students must parse the image showing two lines of working with an arrow and star. This is a representation commonly used in UK KS3 maths but requires some familiarity.

2. Mathematical reasoning: Recognizing that to go from "x + 7" to "x", you subtract 7. This is a single conceptual step requiring understanding of additive inverses.

3. Answer selection: Matching "-7" to option D.

The item is interesting because distractors B and C (multiply/divide by 7) introduce a cross-operation confusion that goes beyond the primary misconception. A student selecting B or C would have a more fundamental misunderstanding than the target misconception. This means the item might capture two tiers of misunderstanding: (1) same-operation error -> A, (2) operation-type confusion -> B or C.

Calibration comparison for the same misconception:
- Simplest: p + 10 equation, difficulty 0.167 -- requires solving
- This item: just identify the operation -- should be easier

However, I want to consider a counterargument: some students who can solve -5 = p + 10 by rote might not be able to articulate what operation they performed. The metacognitive demand could make this harder than expected for procedurally-oriented students. That said, the multiple choice format with -7 as an option makes it quite straightforward even for those students -- they can just think "what gets rid of +7? Oh, -7."

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.14, slightly below the simplest calibration item. IRT difficulty around -0.7. Discrimination around 1.3 -- solid but not exceptional because of potential ceiling effects. Very low guessing since even weak students can often recognize the additive inverse in this direct format.
