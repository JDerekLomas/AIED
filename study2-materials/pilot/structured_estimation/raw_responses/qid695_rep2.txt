Analysing: 18 / 2 + 2 x 2 = ?

The correct solution requires BIDMAS: do multiplication and division first (left to right within that tier), then addition. So 18/2 = 9, 2x2 = 4, then 9+4 = 13 (B).

This is a classic order-of-operations item. It's one of the most standard types of BODMAS questions students encounter in KS3 (ages 11-14). The misconception being tested - carrying out operations left to right regardless of priority - is extremely common, particularly among younger students and those who haven't consolidated the rule.

However, because this is such a standard presentation, many students will have practiced similar items extensively. The numbers are small and friendly. I think the item functions well as a diagnostic but won't be terribly difficult for the typical student in the 11-16 range. Students who have any familiarity with BODMAS will get it right.

The left-to-right distractor C (22) is highly plausible for students with the misconception. Distractor A (3) requires a more unusual error. Distractor D (12) is the weakest.

Comparing to the calibration anchor with the same misconception (0.134 classical difficulty), I think this is comparable or slightly easier due to simpler numbers. I'll estimate around 0.15 classical difficulty, acknowledging that despite simpler numbers, some students may find pure arithmetic expressions harder to parse than mixed fraction/decimal expressions because the latter may trigger more careful thinking.

For IRT parameters, I expect moderate-to-good discrimination since it cleanly separates BODMAS knowledge. The item is too straightforward for guessing to be a factor.
