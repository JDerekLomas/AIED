Analyzing 1/3 + 1/4 + 2/3 + 3/4 with correct answer C (2).

This item is interesting because it can be solved two ways: by recognizing complementary fractions (1/3+2/3 and 1/4+3/4 each make 1) or by brute-force common denominator conversion. The complementary approach rewards mathematical insight; the brute-force approach rewards procedural fluency.

The misconception "adds numerators and denominators" maps directly to distractor B: (1+1+2+3)/(3+4+3+4) = 7/14 = 1/2. Interestingly, 7/14 simplifies to 1/2, which is a "nice" number that could feel right to a student, making this distractor quite seductive.

Distractor A (7/12): The numerator 7 suggests adding numerators correctly, but 12 as denominator suggests the student found LCD for thirds and fourths but then just added numerators without converting. This is a plausible error pattern.

Distractor D (28/12): 28/12 = 7/3 which is about 2.33. This could result from a computational error in the conversion process.

For difficulty estimation: fraction addition is KS3 content, typically taught around Year 7-8. By the time students are 14-16, many can do this. But the four-term sum and the need for LCD or regrouping makes it non-trivial. The diagnostic context means this is likely given to students who are still learning fractions.

I think this is slightly easier than the inequality problem (0.569) but harder than the simple equation (0.167). The strong misconception pull toward B will catch many students. I estimate around 40-45% incorrect, putting it in moderate difficulty range.
