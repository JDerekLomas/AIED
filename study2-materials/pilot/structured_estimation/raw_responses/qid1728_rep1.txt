Let me work through this item carefully. The expression is 3/4 - 1/4 × 1/5.

By BODMAS rules, multiplication comes before subtraction:
1/4 × 1/5 = 1/20
3/4 - 1/20 = 15/20 - 1/20 = 14/20 = 7/10 (answer C)

The tested misconception is "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." A student making this error would compute:
3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2
1/2 × 1/5 = 1/10 (answer B)

This is a well-known and persistent misconception. The fact that 3/4 - 1/4 simplifies so neatly to 1/2 makes the left-to-right approach feel natural and reinforcing — students get a clean intermediate answer, which makes them more confident in the wrong approach. This makes distractor B particularly seductive.

Distractor A (2/16) is less obviously connected to a common error pathway and seems implausible to most students. Distractor D (5/10) might attract students who partially attempt the correct method but make arithmetic errors with common denominators.

For calibration: the analogous item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had difficulty 0.134. That item mixed decimals and fractions, which might actually be easier because converting 1/5 to 0.2 is straightforward. Here, the student must handle fraction subtraction with unlike denominators (fourths and twentieths), adding a procedural hurdle. I estimate this is moderately harder — perhaps 0.18-0.28 classical difficulty.

The item should discriminate well because the primary misconception maps cleanly onto one distractor, meaning high-ability students will almost always get it right while mid-ability students are likely to fall for B.
