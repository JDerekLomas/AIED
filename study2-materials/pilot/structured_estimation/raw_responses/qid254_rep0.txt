Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks students to identify which calculation correctly computes the mean of 0, 1, 3, 4, 7.

The correct answer is A: (1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3

Wait, let me reconsider. The numbers are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. The sum is 0+1+3+4+7 = 15, and there are 5 numbers, so the mean is 15/5 = 3.

Looking at option A: (1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3. This is correct because adding 0 doesn't change the sum.

Option B: 0+1+3+4+7÷5 - This would be evaluated as 0+1+3+4+(7÷5) = 0+1+3+4+1.4 = 9.4 due to order of operations. This tests the misconception about carrying out operations left to right.

Option C: (1+3+4+7)/4 = 15/4 = 3.75. This incorrectly excludes 0 from the count AND the sum.

Option D: None of them - This would be chosen by students who think 0 must be explicitly included in the numerator.

The misconception tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order" - this relates to option B, where students might think B is correct if they don't understand that division happens before addition without parentheses.

Actually, looking more carefully at A - it doesn't include 0 in the sum explicitly, but since 0+1+3+4+7 = 1+3+4+7 = 15, this is mathematically correct. The question is testing whether students understand:
1. Order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)
2. That adding 0 doesn't change a sum
3. The mean formula

This is a relatively straightforward item but has some subtle traps. The misconception about order of operations is quite common among secondary students.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The order of operations item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245
- This item is similar in testing order of operations but presented differently

This item requires students to:
1. Know the mean formula (sum/count)
2. Recognize that 0 can be omitted from addition
3. Understand order of operations to reject B
4. Count correctly (5 numbers, not 4)

The distractors are fairly plausible, especially B for students who don't understand BIDMAS, and C/D for students who are confused about whether to include 0.

Given the comparison to the calibration item testing the same misconception, I'd expect this to be slightly easier or similar in difficulty since it's more directly about recognizing correct notation rather than computing.
