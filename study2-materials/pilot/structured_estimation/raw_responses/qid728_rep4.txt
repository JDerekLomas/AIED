Target item: Add brackets to 16-6+4÷2 to make 7. Correct answer is D: (16-6+4)÷2 = 7.

Verification of all options:
A) 16-(6+4)÷2: inside brackets first: 6+4=10, then 10÷2=5 (division before subtraction), then 16-5=11.
B) (16-6)+4÷2: brackets first: 10, then 4÷2=2 (division next), then 10+2=12.
C) 16-6+(4÷2): brackets first: 4÷2=2, then 16-6+2=12. The brackets here are actually redundant since BODMAS already prioritizes the division.
D) (16-6+4)÷2: brackets first: 16-6+4=14, then 14÷2=7. Correct.

This is a classic BODMAS/order of operations question, a staple of KS3 mathematics. The item is well-designed in that it requires genuine understanding rather than rote application. Students need to evaluate how different bracket placements change the computation.

One subtle aspect: a student with the left-to-right misconception evaluates 16-6+4÷2 as 7 already, so they might think "none of these brackets are needed" or might pick any option at random. Alternatively, they might check D and confirm it gives 7 (because their left-to-right computation of the inside still gives 14). This means the misconception could paradoxically lead to the correct answer through incorrect reasoning.

Wait -- actually, inside the brackets of D, (16-6+4) = 14 regardless of whether you use BODMAS or left-to-right, because there's only addition and subtraction (same priority, evaluated left to right). So both correct and misconception students would get 14÷2 = 7 for option D. The question is whether students with the misconception can even parse the question properly.

For difficulty: BODMAS is taught early in secondary school and revisited frequently. The computational demands are moderate. Looking at calibration, the similar misconception item had classical difficulty 0.134. But that was a direct calculation. This requires evaluating multiple expressions, which is harder. I'd estimate around 0.32.

The discrimination should be solid. The item separates students who understand brackets and order of operations from those who don't. The four-option format with meaningful distractors helps.
