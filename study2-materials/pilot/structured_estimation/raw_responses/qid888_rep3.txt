This item tests expanding double brackets where both contain negative terms: (m-5)(m-7). The correct expansion yields m² - 12m + 35 (B).

The critical step is (-5)×(-7). Students holding the misconception that negative times negative is negative will get -35 instead of +35, selecting D. This misconception is widespread — it stems from overgeneralising the rule that "negatives make things negative."

Considering the cognitive demands: students must (1) know the FOIL/grid method, (2) correctly multiply four pairs of terms, (3) combine like terms, and (4) handle signed arithmetic correctly. That's a moderate cognitive load. However, the question format is very standard — this is exactly how expanding brackets appears in textbooks and exams.

Calibration reasoning: The equation-solving items (calibration examples 1 and 5) ranged from 0.167 to 0.569 in classical difficulty, depending on complexity. The same-misconception factorising item was 0.473. Expanding brackets is a core skill taught extensively, but the double-negative trap catches many students. I think this falls in the 0.35-0.45 range.

One consideration: option D differs from B only in the sign of the constant term. Students who work carefully through the middle terms but slip on (-5)(-7) will choose D. This makes D a very strong distractor. Options A and C are less plausible — A requires two errors, and C requires ignoring both negatives.

The discrimination should be fairly high because the item cleanly separates students who understand signed multiplication from those who don't. There's minimal guessing advantage since you really need to work through the expansion.
