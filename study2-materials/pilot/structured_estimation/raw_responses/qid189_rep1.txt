Let me analyze this item carefully.

**The Question:**
Find the 15th term of the sequence where u_n = 1 - 3n

**Correct Solution:**
u_15 = 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -44

So the correct answer is A) -44

**Analyzing the Distractors:**

- A) -44 (CORRECT): 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -44
- B) -46: This might come from 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -46 (arithmetic error, subtracting 1 instead of adding)
- C) -14: This could come from (1-3) × 15 ÷ something, or perhaps 1 - 15 = -14 (ignoring the 3)
- D) -30: This could come from -3 × 15 ÷ something = -45/1.5? Or perhaps 1 - 3 - 15 - 15 = -32? Let me think... Actually, if someone does left-to-right: (1-3) × 15 = -2 × 15 = -30. YES! This is the misconception being tested.

**The Misconception:**
"Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"

If a student reads 1 - 3n and calculates left to right:
- First: 1 - 3 = -2
- Then: -2 × 15 = -30

This gives distractor D, which confirms the misconception being tested.

**Difficulty Analysis:**
- The concept is straightforward: substitution into a formula
- Requires understanding of order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)
- The formula notation u_n is somewhat abstract
- Students need to know that 3n means 3 × n and that multiplication comes before subtraction

Comparing to calibration items:
- The order of operations item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245
- This item is similar in testing order of operations but involves substitution and larger numbers
- The formula notation adds some abstraction

This item should be relatively easy for students who understand both substitution and order of operations. The misconception is common but the question is quite clear. I'd estimate it's similar to or slightly harder than the order of operations calibration item.

**Rating Justifications:**
- Concept complexity: Involves sequences, substitution, order of operations - moderate (4)
- Procedural steps: Substitute n=15, multiply 3×15=45, subtract from 1 - about 3 steps (3)
- Abstraction level: Uses algebraic notation u_n, which is moderately abstract (5)
- Prerequisite knowledge: Need to know sequence notation, substitution, order of operations (5)
- Distractor plausibility: D is very plausible for the misconception, B is a common arithmetic error, C is less obvious (6)
- Misconception strength: Order of operations errors are common (6)
- Question clarity: Very clear what's being asked (9)
- Cognitive load: Moderate - need to remember the formula and compute (4)
- Age appropriateness: Perfect for KS3/KS4 (9)
- Transfer distance: Standard textbook presentation (3)
- Visual complexity: Simple algebraic notation (3)
- Solution uniqueness: Need to understand both substitution AND order of operations (7)

**Predictions:**
Given the comparison to the calibration item testing the same misconception (classical difficulty 0.134), but this item has more steps and uses sequence notation, I'd estimate slightly higher difficulty. However, the numbers are clean and the question is clear.

Classical difficulty: ~0.20-0.25
IRT difficulty: ~-0.3 to 0.0
IRT discrimination: Should be good since it clearly targets the misconception ~1.3-1.5
Guessing: Low, as the distractors are well-constructed ~0.05
