The target item is 3/10 + 5/10, simplified. This is basic fraction addition with like denominators plus a simplification step.

Let me think about each distractor carefully:
- A (8/20) captures the classic misconception: adding numerators AND denominators (3+5=8, 10+10=20). This is the stated misconception and is very common, especially among younger or lower-ability students.
- B (8/10) is the unsimplified correct answer. Students who can add fractions but skip simplification will land here. This is arguably the most attractive distractor because many students will feel satisfied reaching 8/10.
- D (4/10) is odd -- perhaps students who simplify 8/10 incorrectly by halving only the numerator, or who made an arithmetic error.

The key challenge is the TWO-step nature: add correctly, then simplify. Having distractor B as a trap for those who only complete step 1 makes this item somewhat tricky despite the simple math.

Comparing to calibration: the simplest calibration item (-5 = p + 10, difficulty 0.167) is straightforward algebra. This fractions item is conceptually simpler but the simplification requirement and strong distractors could push difficulty higher. I'd estimate around 30-35% incorrect.

The item should discriminate well because it cleanly separates three levels: (1) students with the add-denominators misconception -> A, (2) students who can add but not simplify -> B, (3) fully competent students -> C.
