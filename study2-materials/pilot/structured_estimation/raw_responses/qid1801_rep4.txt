This item requires solving the compound inequality -5 < 2x + 1 < 5. The correct approach: subtract 1 from all three parts to get -6 < 2x < 4, then divide all by 2 to get -3 < x < 2 (answer B).

Considering the item characteristics more carefully in relation to the calibration set:

The simplest calibration item (-5 = p + 10, difficulty 0.167) is a one-step equation. The hardest (2n + 3 <= 3n - 7, difficulty 0.569, b = 0.808) requires collecting terms with variables on both sides and involves an inequality.

This target item has a compound inequality which is a topic typically covered later in the curriculum (Year 10-11 for most UK students). The actual algebra is straightforward - just two inverse operations - but the format of applying them to three simultaneous expressions is what makes it challenging. Many students may not have encountered this format frequently.

Let me reconsider the distractors carefully:
- A: -9 < x < 11 - these are large numbers suggesting a fundamental misunderstanding, perhaps (-5-1)*2 = -12... no, -9 could come from (-5)*2 + 1 = -9 and 5*2 + 1 = 11. So this catches students who multiply by 2 and add 1 (same operations as in the expression, not inverses). This directly tests the stated misconception.
- C: -2 < x < 2 - could come from (-5+1)/2 = -2 and (5-1)/2 = 2. So add 1 on left, subtract on right, then divide. Or possibly subtract 1 correctly giving -6 and 4, then add 2 instead of dividing... (-6+2=-4, 4+2=6)... no. Actually (-5+1)/2 = -2 fits perfectly for a student who adds instead of subtracts on the left side.
- D: -3.5 < x < 1.5 - possibly ((-5)-2)/2 = -3.5 and (5-2)/2 = 1.5. Subtracting 2 instead of dividing by 2 first, then dividing... or treating the coefficient differently.

Given that distractor A directly embodies the "same operation" misconception (multiply and add rather than divide and subtract), and it produces rather extreme values, students might recognize A as implausible. The more subtle distractors C and D are likely more attractive to partially-knowledgeable students.

This analysis suggests moderate difficulty with reasonable discrimination. I'll estimate slightly higher difficulty than the factorising item but not quite as high as the hardest calibration item, because compound inequalities are less commonly encountered but the steps are simpler.
