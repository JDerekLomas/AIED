This item asks students to identify which pair of numbers has a product of -24. The core concept is multiplication of signed integers: a negative times a positive yields a negative, while a negative times a negative yields a positive.

Let me check each option:
A) -3 x -8 = +24 (not -24, because negative x negative = positive)
B) -4 x 6 = -24 (correct, negative x positive = negative)
C) -10 x -14 = +140 (not -24, both wrong sign and wrong magnitude)
D) -3 x 9 = -27 (correct sign but wrong magnitude)

The misconception tested is "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer." Options A is the primary distractor targeting this misconception -- a student who thinks (-3)(-8) = -24 would select A. Option C also involves two negatives but the product magnitude is wrong too, so it's a weaker distractor. Option D has the right sign pattern but wrong magnitude, catching computation errors.

Comparing to the calibration item about factorising (Tom and Katie), which also tests "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative," that item had classical difficulty 0.473 and IRT b = 0.404. That item required algebraic reasoning about factoring quadratics, which is considerably more complex. This item is more direct -- just multiply two numbers -- so it should be easier.

However, the distractor A is quite plausible because students who hold the misconception will immediately see -3 and -8 and think "that gives -24." The question is relatively straightforward in its wording.

I estimate this is a moderate-difficulty item, somewhat easier than the factorising item since it only requires basic integer multiplication rather than algebraic manipulation. Classical difficulty perhaps around 0.35-0.40, IRT difficulty around 0.1 to 0.3.
