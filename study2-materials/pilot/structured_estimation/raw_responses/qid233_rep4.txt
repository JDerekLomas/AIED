Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks students to convert a calculation written with standard operators into proper algebraic convention (fraction notation).

Original expression: 2 ÷ (3 + a × b)

The correct algebraic convention would be:
- The division becomes a fraction with 2 as numerator
- The denominator is (3 + a × b)
- Within the parentheses, multiplication (a × b) should be performed before addition (BIDMAS/BODMAS)
- In algebraic convention, a × b is written as ab (no multiplication sign)
- So the denominator should be: ab + 3 or 3 + ab

The correct answer is C: 2/(ab + 3)

Now let me analyze the distractors:

A) 2/3 + ab - This would result from carrying out operations left to right: 2 ÷ 3 first, then + ab. This is the misconception being tested.

B) 2/(b(a+3)) - This shows a different misunderstanding, possibly reordering the operations incorrectly or misreading the expression.

C) 2/(ab + 3) - CORRECT. Shows proper order of operations and algebraic convention.

D) 2/(a × b + 3) - This is almost correct but doesn't follow algebraic convention of writing multiplication without the × sign. This is a subtle distractor.

The misconception tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order" - this matches distractor A.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The order of operations item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245
- This item is similar but involves algebraic notation conversion, which adds complexity

Key considerations:
- Students need to understand order of operations (BIDMAS)
- They need to understand algebraic convention (no × sign, fraction notation)
- The distractors are fairly plausible, especially D which is very close to correct
- The misconception of left-to-right operations is common

This item seems moderately difficult because:
1. It requires understanding of order of operations
2. It requires understanding algebraic conventions
3. Distractor D is very close to correct (only differs by having × sign)
4. The question is clear but requires careful reading

I estimate this is slightly harder than the calibration order of operations item because it also tests algebraic notation conventions.
