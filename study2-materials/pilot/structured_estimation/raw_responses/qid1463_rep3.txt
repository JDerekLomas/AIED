This item tests whether students can correctly compute b^2 when b is negative, within the context of the quadratic formula. For 5h^2 - 3h - 2 = 0, we have b = -3, so b^2 = 9 (answer C). Students holding the misconception that (-3)^2 = -9 would select D.

Let me think about this from a student perspective. A Year 10/11 student encounters this during their GCSE algebra unit. The quadratic formula is one of the more challenging formulas they learn. The question doesn't ask them to solve the whole thing - just identify one component (b^2). This is actually somewhat helpful as scaffolding.

But the partial formula notation "? +/- sqrt(triangle - ?)" is ambiguous. The question marks represent different values (numerator has -b, and inside the sqrt we have -4ac). Students need to parse this carefully. Some might get confused by the format itself rather than the math.

The answer choices come in pairs: 6/-6 and 9/-9. The 9/-9 pair corresponds to (-3)^2 vs thinking it's -9. The 6/-6 pair might attract students who think b^2 means 2*b = 2*3 = 6 or 2*(-3) = -6, confusing squaring with doubling. This is actually a reasonable alternative misconception.

Looking at the calibration data, the factorising item with the same misconception had b=0.404 and discrimination 1.451. That item required understanding factorisation but the actual misconception test was fairly direct. This item adds the quadratic formula layer. I think it's harder.

The inequality solving item had b=0.808 with discrimination 1.050. I'd place this item similarly - around b=0.70. Classical difficulty maybe 0.55-0.60.

For discrimination, the item tests a specific misconception cleanly but the prerequisite knowledge barrier means some capable students who haven't learned the formula yet will get it wrong, slightly lowering discrimination. I'll estimate a=1.15.
