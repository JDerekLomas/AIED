Analyzing the equation 8x/5 = 40 and the two proposed solutions.

Starting with Katie: She claims x/5 = 5. Dividing both sides by 8: LHS becomes (8x/5)/8 = x/5, RHS becomes 40/8 = 5. So x/5 = 5. This checks out — Katie is correct.

Now Tom: He claims 8x = 8. If he were correctly eliminating the denominator, he'd multiply both sides by 5: 8x = 200. Instead he got 8x = 8, which looks like he divided 40 by 5 to get 8. This is the inverse operation error — dividing when he should multiply.

So only Katie is correct (answer B).

Thinking about difficulty: This item requires students to (1) understand how to manipulate equations with fractions, (2) verify someone else's algebraic reasoning, and (3) identify a subtle error. The "who is correct" format is cognitively demanding because students must track two separate lines of reasoning.

The misconception here is particularly tricky because 40/5 = 8 is an easy mental calculation that "feels right" — the numbers work out cleanly, making Tom's error seductive. Meanwhile, Katie's step requires recognizing that dividing both sides by 8 is a valid partial simplification, which some students may not see as a standard approach.

Comparing with calibration: The factorising "who is correct" item had classical difficulty 0.473. This item involves similar meta-reasoning but with equation solving rather than factorising. The fractional equation adds complexity. I'd place this slightly above that, around 0.48-0.55.

The discrimination should be solid — students who understand inverse operations will get this right, while those who don't will be drawn to option A or C. I estimate a = 1.15-1.35.
