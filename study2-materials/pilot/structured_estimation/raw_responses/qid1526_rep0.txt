This item asks students to add two fractions: 3/5 + 2/7. To solve correctly, students need to find a common denominator (35), convert each fraction (21/35 + 10/35), then add numerators to get 31/35 (option B).

The tested misconception is adding numerators and denominators separately: 3+2=5, 5+7=12, giving 5/12 (option C). This is an extremely common misconception among younger students.

Option A (11/35) appears to come from correctly finding the common denominator but making an error in the numerator addition or cross-multiplication (perhaps 3+2=5 then something with 7 and 5... or maybe 3*2 + 5 = 11? Not immediately obvious). Actually, 3*7=21 and 2*5=10, so 21+10=31. Maybe 11 comes from just adding 3+5+2+1? Hard to say. It could be from adding cross-products incorrectly: 3*2 + 5 = 11? This distractor is somewhat plausible.

Option D (5/35) looks like adding numerators (3+2=5) but getting the correct denominator (5*7=35). This represents a partial misconception where the student knows to multiply denominators but still adds numerators.

Comparing to calibration items: The equation -5=p+10 had classical difficulty 0.167 (easy). The fraction addition item requires procedural knowledge of common denominators, which many students struggle with. I'd estimate this is moderately difficult, perhaps around 0.35-0.45 classical difficulty. The misconception of adding numerators/denominators is very strong and common, making the distractors quite attractive.

The item is presented in a visual format (circles linked together) which adds a small layer of interpretation but is fairly standard for fraction addition pyramid tasks. The question clarity is high once the visual is understood.

For IRT parameters: moderate difficulty around 0.1-0.4 on the b scale, decent discrimination since it cleanly separates those who understand common denominators from those who don't, and low guessing since students with the misconception will be drawn to specific wrong answers.
