This item requires rearranging F = v^2/r to make v the subject. The correct procedure is:
1. Multiply both sides by r: Fr = v^2
2. Take the square root: v = sqrt(Fr)

This gives answer C. Let me analyze the distractors:

A) v = rF^2 -- This suggests the student squared F instead of taking the square root, and multiplied by r. This is a significant conceptual error mixing up operations.
B) v = sqrt(F/r) -- The student divided by r instead of multiplying. This is the "same operation rather than inverse" misconception -- since v^2 is divided by r in the original, the student divides again rather than multiplying.
D) v = r*sqrt(F) -- The student partially rearranged, getting the square root of F but multiplying by r rather than including r under the radical. This shows partial understanding.

Comparing to calibration items: The equation-solving items range from easy (p+10=-5, difficulty 0.167) to harder (inequality, difficulty 0.569). This item involves algebraic manipulation with a squared variable and a fraction, which is more complex than simple linear equations but a standard GCSE topic. The presence of the square root operation adds complexity. The distractors are quite plausible -- option B in particular targets the exact misconception, and option D represents a common partial-understanding error.

I'd estimate this is moderately difficult, similar to the factorising item (0.473) or slightly harder, given the multi-step nature and the need to handle both multiplication and square roots. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.50-0.55.
