Analyzing: 1/3 + 1/2 x 1/3

The correct procedure: multiply first (BIDMAS), 1/2 x 1/3 = 1/6, then add 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2. Answer A.

The misconception (left-to-right computation) yields: 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6, then 5/6 x 1/3 = 5/18. Answer B.

Let me think about how each distractor might arise:
- A (1/2): Correct, requires BIDMAS + fraction operations
- B (5/18): Left-to-right error, the primary misconception
- C (2/9): Perhaps from 1/3 x 2/3? Or some error like treating the whole expression as (1x1)/(3x2) x 1/3 = 1/6 x 1/3... no that gives 1/18. Maybe (1+1)/(3x3) x 1 = 2/9. Hard to reverse-engineer exactly, but it catches some fraction arithmetic confusion.
- D (1/15): Could be from adding all denominators somehow: 1/(3+2) x 1/3 = 1/15. Or misapplying addition of fractions as 1/(3+2) = 1/5, then 1/5 x 1/3 = 1/15.

The item is well-designed. The primary distractor (B) is highly plausible for the target misconception. The other distractors catch different types of fraction errors.

Comparing to the similar calibration item (classical difficulty 0.134): I think this is somewhat harder. The calibration item uses 0.4 - 1/5 x 3, where the decimal-to-fraction conversion might actually cue students to think more carefully. Here, all fractions and a simple "+" sign might lure more students into adding first. I'd estimate around 0.18-0.30 classical difficulty.

This item requires two skills: order of operations AND fraction arithmetic (finding common denominators). The compound skill requirement could push difficulty up a bit. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.28, IRT b around 0.10.
