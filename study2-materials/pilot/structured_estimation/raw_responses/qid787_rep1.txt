Analyzing the target item. The original equation is 2v - 5 = 6v - 3.

First, let me check Jo's claim: 2v - 8 = 6v.
Starting from 2v - 5 = 6v - 3, if we correctly add 3 to both sides: 2v - 5 + 3 = 6v - 3 + 3, giving 2v - 2 = 6v. Jo got 2v - 8, not 2v - 2. It looks like Jo subtracted 3 from the left side instead of adding it. This is the classic "same operation instead of inverse" error. Jo is wrong.

Now Paul's claim: 2v = 6v - 8.
Starting from 2v - 5 = 6v - 3, if we correctly add 5 to both sides: 2v - 5 + 5 = 6v - 3 + 5, giving 2v = 6v + 2. Paul got 6v - 8, which would come from subtracting 5 from the right: 6v - 3 - 5 = 6v - 8. Again the same misconception — subtracting instead of adding. Paul is also wrong.

The correct answer is D: Neither is correct.

This is a higher-order item. Students aren't asked to solve the equation directly but to evaluate others' algebraic reasoning. This "who is correct" format is known to be more demanding because it requires:
- Understanding the valid algebraic moves
- Checking each person's work against those rules
- Synthesizing both evaluations into a single judgment

The distractors are very plausible. A student who shares the misconception would verify both Jo and Paul as correct and choose C. A student who only partially understands might correctly identify one error but not the other, choosing A or B.

Looking at the calibration set, the Tom/Katie factorising item has a similar structure (evaluate two claims) and had classical difficulty 0.473 and b = 0.404. However, that item's misconception (negative times negative) is perhaps more commonly taught explicitly. The misconception here (same operation vs. inverse) is very persistent and the dual-verification requirement increases difficulty. The inequality item testing the same misconception had difficulty 0.569 and b = 0.808 with only a single step to evaluate.

I'd place this item somewhat harder than the factorising item but in a similar range to the inequality item, perhaps slightly below it since the algebra is simpler even though two checks are needed. My estimates: classical difficulty ~0.55, b ~0.60.
