This item shows Isaac's equation-solving work: x - 7 = ... on one line, then x = ... on the next. An arrow with a star indicates the operation performed. The student must identify +7 as the correct operation.

Key considerations:

1. Content domain: This sits squarely in early algebra / equation solving, appropriate for KS3 (ages 11-14). It targets a foundational skill.

2. Cognitive demand: Very low. No calculation needed. Pure recognition of inverse operations. A student simply needs to know that to cancel "- 7" you do "+ 7".

3. Distractor analysis:
   - A (+7): Correct -- inverse of -7
   - B (x7): Weak distractor. Multiplication is a different operation class entirely. Only very confused students would pick this.
   - C (/7): Similarly weak. Division isn't related to the subtraction shown.
   - D (-7): The key distractor testing the misconception. A student who thinks you repeat the operation would choose this.

The fact that two of four distractors are quite implausible (multiply and divide) means this item effectively becomes almost a two-choice question for students who have basic understanding of operation types. This could inflate the correct response rate and reduce discrimination somewhat.

4. Visual element: The diagram with arrow and star is a standard UK maths textbook convention. Most students in the target age range will have encountered this format. It adds minimal complexity.

Calibration anchoring: Comparing to the first calibration item (same misconception, b = -0.702, classical difficulty 0.167) which requires actual computation, this item should be easier. But the first calibration item also has strong distractors. I think this item might be slightly easier, perhaps classical difficulty 0.10-0.18.

Given the weak distractors B and C, discrimination might be somewhat lower than ideal. Students who partially understand will easily eliminate B and C, leaving a 50/50 between A and D. This could actually boost discrimination for the specific misconception being tested.

Estimate: classical difficulty ~0.18, IRT b ~ -0.55, moderate-good discrimination.
