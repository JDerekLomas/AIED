Target item: Find two numbers whose product is -24.

First, let me consider what students need to do:
1. Understand "product" means multiplication
2. Know the sign rules for multiplication (neg x neg = pos, neg x pos = neg)
3. Verify the arithmetic for each option

Working through options:
A) -3 x -8: magnitude = 24, sign = positive. Result = +24, not -24.
B) -4 x 6: magnitude = 24, sign = negative. Result = -24. Correct.
C) -10 x -14: magnitude = 140, sign = positive. Result = +140, not -24.
D) -3 x 9: magnitude = 27, sign = negative. Result = -27, not -24.

The item has a layered structure: students could fail on vocabulary ("product"), sign rules, or arithmetic. This creates multiple pathways to incorrect answers, which is interesting psychometrically.

Option A is the primary misconception-targeted distractor and it's very strong because the magnitude is correct. A student who simply ignores or misapplies sign rules and computes 3 x 8 = 24 will choose A confidently.

Option D could attract students who get the sign right but miscalculate or don't bother checking 3 x 9.

Thinking about the population: UK secondary students across ages 11-16. For Year 7 students this could be quite challenging; for Year 10+ it should be straightforward. Across the full age range, I'd expect maybe 35-45% incorrect.

The calibration item with the same misconception (factorising, b = 0.404) is more complex. I'd place this item somewhat below that, perhaps b around 0.1-0.3. The discrimination should be solid since the misconception-targeting is clean, maybe around 1.2-1.4. Some guessing possible from option C being easily eliminated, effectively making it a 3-option item for attentive students.
