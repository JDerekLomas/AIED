The target item requires rearranging A = (1/2)(b x h) to make h the subject. This is a standard formula rearrangement question typical of KS3/KS4 algebra.

Working through the correct solution:
A = (1/2)bh
2A = bh (multiply both sides by 2)
2A/b = h (divide both sides by b)
So h = 2A/b, which is option B.

Analyzing the distractors from a psychometric perspective:

Option A (h = (1/2)(b x A)) simply substitutes A where h was without doing any algebraic manipulation. This is a very naive error -- the student treats rearranging as just "swapping" variables.

Option C (h = A/(2b)) is the most dangerous distractor. A student who divides both sides by (1/2) incorrectly -- or who thinks "there's a 2 in the denominator so I divide by 2b" -- would choose this. It represents dividing by 2 rather than multiplying by 2, which is exactly the tested misconception.

Option D is the "none of the above" option which might attract students who are uncertain.

The key challenge here is dealing with the (1/2) coefficient. Many students struggle with fractions in equations. The two-step nature (multiply by 2, then divide by b) puts this at a medium difficulty level.

Looking at the calibration anchors, this feels comparable to the inequality problem (classical difficulty 0.569) but perhaps slightly easier since the context (area of a triangle) is very familiar. I'll estimate around 0.45-0.50 for classical difficulty.

For IRT parameters, the discrimination should be solid because the distractors specifically target the misconception. However, option D could reduce discrimination slightly as it doesn't correspond to a specific error pattern.
