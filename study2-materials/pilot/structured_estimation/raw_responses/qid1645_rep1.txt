Analyzing the item: Solve 3p^2 + 9 = 39, giving all solutions.

The solution path is: subtract 9 -> 3p^2 = 30 -> divide by 3 -> p^2 = 10 -> p = +/- sqrt(10).

This is a multi-step equation involving a squared variable, and critically the answer is an irrational number (sqrt(10)). Many UK secondary students are uncomfortable with surd answers, which could push them toward "nicer" looking answers like p=+/-2 or p=+/-4.

Distractor analysis:
- Option A: n=+/-5. Wrong variable label, and 5 doesn't follow cleanly from any obvious error path. The use of 'n' instead of 'p' might be a deliberate trap for students not reading carefully, but it's also somewhat implausible as a misconception-driven error.
- Option C: p=+/-2. This could arise from doing operations in wrong order: 39/3=13, then 13-9=4, then sqrt(4)=2. This is a genuine procedural error.
- Option D: p=+/-4. This could come from adding 9 instead of subtracting: 39+9=48, 48/3=16, sqrt(16)=4. This directly tests the stated misconception of using same operation instead of inverse.

The key difficulty factors: (1) three inverse operations needed in correct order, (2) the answer involves a surd which students may not expect, (3) students need to remember both positive and negative roots.

Calibration comparison: The factorising item (Tom and Katie, b=0.404, 47.3% incorrect) requires conceptual understanding of factoring. This item requires procedural fluency with equation solving plus comfort with surds. I'd place it slightly harder, around 50-60% incorrect.

The discrimination might be slightly lower than the calibration items because the surd answer could cause even competent students to hesitate or switch to a "cleaner" distractor. I'd estimate a around 1.0-1.2.

For guessing, with 4 options the baseline is 0.25, but the presence of the wrong variable in option A should help students eliminate at least that one. Effective guessing probably around 0.10-0.15.
