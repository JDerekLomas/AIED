Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks students to identify which calculation correctly computes the mean of 0, 1, 3, 4, 7.

The correct answer is A: (1+3+4+7)/5

Wait, let me check this. The mean of 0, 1, 3, 4, 7 should be (0+1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3.

Looking at option A: (1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3. This gives the correct numerical answer because adding 0 doesn't change the sum, but it's technically missing the 0 in the numerator. However, since 0+1+3+4+7 = 1+3+4+7 = 15, the answer is still correct.

Option B: 0+1+3+4+7÷5 - This would be interpreted as 0+1+3+4+(7÷5) = 0+1+3+4+1.4 = 9.4 due to order of operations. This is wrong.

Option C: (1+3+4+7)/4 = 15/4 = 3.75 - This divides by 4 instead of 5, which is wrong.

Option D: None of them - This would be chosen if students think none are correct.

The misconception tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order" - this relates to option B, where students might think B is correct if they don't understand that division happens before addition.

Key analysis:
- The item tests understanding of order of operations AND the mean formula
- Students need to recognize that option B doesn't have proper grouping, so BODMAS/PEMDAS applies
- The distractor B is attractive to students who don't consider order of operations
- Option C tests whether students understand to divide by the count of ALL numbers (including 0)
- Option A is technically correct because including 0 in the sum doesn't change it

Concept complexity: Involves mean calculation and order of operations - two concepts (moderate)
Procedural steps: Need to evaluate each option mentally, understand mean formula, apply order of operations
Abstraction level: Fairly concrete - working with specific numbers
Prerequisite knowledge: Mean formula, order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS)
Distractor plausibility: B is very plausible for students who don't know order of operations; C catches those who exclude 0
Misconception strength: Order of operations is a common misconception
Question clarity: Clear what's being asked
Cognitive load: Moderate - need to evaluate multiple options
Age appropriateness: Very appropriate for 11-16 (mean and order of operations are core topics)
Transfer distance: Somewhat non-standard - asking about which calculation rather than computing
Visual complexity: Low - simple expressions
Solution uniqueness: Need to understand both concepts fully

Comparing to calibration items:
- The order of operations item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245
- This item is similar but requires evaluating multiple options and understanding mean formula too
- This should be slightly harder due to the additional concept and evaluation of options

I estimate this item is relatively easy-moderate, similar to the order of operations calibration item but perhaps slightly harder due to the need to evaluate multiple expressions.
