Item: Substitute x = -1 into y = x² - 2x + 1. Answer is 4 (B).

I want to think about this from the student population perspective. UK secondary students ages 11-16 represent a wide range. Substitution into quadratics appears in the KS3/KS4 curriculum, typically Year 8-9 for tables of values leading to graph plotting.

The negative number misconception tested here is extremely common. Research consistently shows that squaring negative numbers is one of the most persistent errors through secondary school. Even GCSE-level students frequently write (-1)² = -1.

What makes this item interesting is the cognitive load: the student must track three separate terms, each involving different operations with -1. This is higher working memory demand than a simple one-step problem.

However, the table format is familiar — it's the standard setup for "complete the table and draw the graph" questions that appear in virtually every quadratic graphing exercise. Students have extensive practice with this format.

I think the difficulty will be driven primarily by the negative number handling. Students who are solid with negatives will find this routine. Those who struggle will be drawn to distractor C (2) most commonly — this is the answer you get if you only make the squaring error but handle -2(-1) = +2 correctly.

For predictions, I'll anchor on the factorisation calibration item (same misconception, classical difficulty 0.473, b = 0.404). This substitution item is more procedural and the format is more familiar, but the arithmetic demands are high. I think difficulty is roughly comparable, perhaps marginally harder because of the multiple negative operations in sequence.
