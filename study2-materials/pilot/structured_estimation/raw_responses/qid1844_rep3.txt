Target item: y=(x-8)(x-6), find y-intercept. Correct: C (0,48).

This is a relatively standard GCSE-level question about quadratic graphs in factored form. The key steps are straightforward: set x=0, compute (-8)(-6)=48.

However, I want to think carefully about what proportion of the 11-16 age range would get this wrong. Younger students (11-13) might not have encountered factored quadratics at all, while older students (14-16) should find this manageable if they understand intercepts.

The misconception "multiplying two negatives gives a negative" is well-documented and persistent. Even students who can state the rule correctly sometimes make errors under cognitive load. Here, the cognitive load isn't enormous, but the factored form adds a layer of unfamiliarity.

Distractor analysis:
- D (0,-48): Target misconception. Very plausible. Students who do everything right except the sign rule land here.
- B: Confusing x-intercepts with y-intercepts AND getting the coordinates wrong. This catches students with a fundamental misunderstanding of intercepts.
- A (0,-14): Adding instead of multiplying the constants. This is a weaker distractor but could catch students who are confused about what operation to perform.

Comparing to calibration: The inequality item (solve 2n+3 <= 3n-7) had difficulty 0.569 and b=0.808, and that tests equation-solving skills. The Tom/Katie item testing the same misconception had difficulty 0.473 and b=0.404.

This item combines graphical understanding with arithmetic. I think it's moderately difficult. The question clarity is somewhat reduced by the apparent text duplication. I'd place this around 0.48 classical difficulty and b around 0.40, similar to the Tom/Katie item but perhaps slightly easier because the procedure itself is simpler once you know to substitute x=0.
