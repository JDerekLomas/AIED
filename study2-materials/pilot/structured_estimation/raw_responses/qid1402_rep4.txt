This item presents the expression 3 + ab and asks students to select the correct verbal description from four options. The correct answer is A: "Add 3 to a multiplied by b."

The core skill tested: understanding that in 3 + ab, the multiplication ab is performed first (by convention/BODMAS), so the expression equals 3 + (a*b). The targeted misconception is processing left to right: 3 + a = (3+a), then multiply by b.

Let me evaluate each distractor's attractiveness:
- B ("Add a and b then add three") -- misreads ab as a+b. A fairly basic error, likely only made by students very new to algebra. Weak distractor for most of the age range.
- C ("Add three to a and then multiply by b") -- the classic left-to-right reading. This is the primary trap and will catch students with the targeted misconception. Strong distractor.
- D ("Add three to b and then multiply by a") -- similar structure to C but reverses a and b. Less natural because reading left to right you'd encounter 'a' before 'b'. Moderate distractor.

Difficulty estimation: The same misconception was tested in calibration item 2, which had 13.4% incorrect. However, that was a computational item where students could potentially arrive at the answer through calculation. This item requires abstract reasoning about notation and language, with no numbers to compute. I think this actually makes it slightly easier in some ways (no arithmetic errors possible) but harder in others (pure conceptual understanding required, plus verbal interpretation).

Looking at the calibration set more broadly: items testing order of operations tend to be on the easier side. The expression is short and the options are clearly distinct. I'd place this around 0.15-0.20 classical difficulty.

For IRT parameters: given similarity to calibration item 2 (b = -0.245, a = 1.552), I'd expect somewhat similar values. Perhaps b around -0.30 and a around 1.35. The discrimination might be slightly lower than the calibration item because the verbal format introduces construct-irrelevant variance (reading comprehension). Guessing should be near zero -- students who understand the concept will confidently pick A.
