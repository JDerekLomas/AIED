Analyzing the target item: students must find x given y = 0.5 in 10x - 6y = 30.

Step-by-step correct approach:
- Substitute y = 0.5 into 10x - 6y = 30
- 10x - 6(0.5) = 30
- 10x - 3 = 30
- 10x = 33
- x = 3.3 (answer C)

Distractor analysis:
- D = 2.7: From 10x = 30 - 3 = 27, x = 2.7. This happens if a student subtracts 3 from 30 instead of adding it, which is exactly the "uses same operation rather than inverse" misconception. When moving -3 to the other side, they keep it as -3 instead of +3.
- A = 4.25: This is 42.5/10. I think this might come from 10x = 6(0.5) + 30 + some error, or perhaps miscomputing 6 * 0.5 as 12.5 somehow. Not immediately obvious but serves as a plausible distractor.
- B = -4.25: Negative of A, catching students who additionally make a sign error.

This is a multi-step problem requiring: (1) understanding table notation, (2) substitution, (3) decimal multiplication, (4) equation solving. The combination of skills makes it moderately challenging.

Looking at calibration: the inequality problem (b = 0.808, p = 0.569) is the hardest, requiring similar algebraic manipulation but with the added complexity of inequality notation. The simple solve p + 10 = -5 (b = -0.702, p = 0.167) is much easier. This item falls somewhere in between but closer to the harder end because of the two-variable equation and decimal work.

I think this item is moderately hard - the combination of substitution, decimal arithmetic, and solving pushes difficulty up. I'll estimate around 50% incorrect, with IRT difficulty around 0.4-0.5.

The discrimination should be reasonable since the misconception-based distractor D directly targets the tested error. However, the other distractors (A, B) are less clearly tied to common errors, which might reduce overall discrimination slightly.
