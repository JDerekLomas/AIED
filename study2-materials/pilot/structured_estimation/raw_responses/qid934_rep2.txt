Analyzing the target item: A table of values for 4x + 2y = 10 with x values 0,1,2,3,4 and the y-value at x=0 replaced by a star.

To solve: substitute x = 0 into 4x + 2y = 10:
0 + 2y = 10
2y = 10
y = 5

Answer: C

Let me think about how students might arrive at each wrong answer:

Option A (20): The tested misconception is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse." From 2y = 10, instead of dividing by 2, a student multiplies by 2, getting y = 20. This is the primary misconception distractor and quite plausible for weaker students.

Option B (3): Harder to trace. Possibly a student who misreads x = 0 as x = 1, giving 4 + 2y = 10, 2y = 6, y = 3. Alternatively, some students might try to find a pattern in the table without using the equation.

Option D (2.5): Could come from 10/4 = 2.5, where a student uses the wrong coefficient. Or perhaps they compute y = 10/(2+2) or something similar.

Contextual features: The table format is common in UK KS3/KS4 curriculum for linear equations. Students need to understand that the table represents coordinate pairs satisfying the equation. The x = 0 case simplifies the problem considerably since the 4x term vanishes.

Difficulty estimation: This is an accessible problem. The substitution with x = 0 is the easiest possible case. However, the two-variable equation and table format require some conceptual understanding beyond simple equation solving. Comparing to calibration item 1 (classical difficulty 0.167, b = -0.702), this should be somewhat harder due to the additional interpretation layer. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.25, b around -0.20.

The discrimination should be reasonable -- the misconception distractor cleanly separates students who understand division as the inverse of multiplication. However, the table format might introduce some noise. I'll estimate a = 1.15.
