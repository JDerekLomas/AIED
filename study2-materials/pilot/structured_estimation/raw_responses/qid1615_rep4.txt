Examining this item: forming an equation from "think of a number, subtract 6, divide by 3, get 21."

The mathematical content involves: variables, equation formation, order of operations (BIDMAS), and understanding grouping notation (fraction bars as implicit parentheses).

Correct answer A: (n-6)/3 = 21. The fraction notation inherently groups the subtraction before the division.

I want to think carefully about the distractor plausibility here. In my experience, option B (n - 6 ÷ 3 = 21) is a strong attractor because students often write equations sequentially as they read the problem. However, there's a subtlety: some students might actually intend option B to mean what option A means — they just don't realize the notation differs. This is precisely the BIDMAS misconception.

Option D (n/3 - 6 = 21) represents a sequencing error. The student might think "divide by 3" and "subtract 6" but get the order wrong. This is a different misconception from the one being tested but could still attract responses.

Option C (3(n-6) = 21) uses multiplication instead of division. This would attract students who confuse the inverse operations, or who think "three times" instead of "divided by three."

Now for calibration. The key reference point is the other BIDMAS item: 0.4 - 1/5 × 3, with classical difficulty 0.134 (very easy). That item was computational. This item is about representation/translation which can be harder because it requires symbolic literacy.

Another reference: the function machine item (classical = 0.295, b = 0.002) also involves translating between representations. That seems like a reasonable comparison, though function machines provide more scaffolding than raw equations.

I think this item falls somewhere between the easy BIDMAS computation item and the function machine item. The "think of a number" framing is very familiar to UK students, which helps. But distinguishing A from B requires genuine understanding of notation.

My estimate: classical difficulty around 0.30, IRT difficulty near 0, good discrimination around 1.3. The guessing parameter should be low — the options are sufficiently distinct that random guessing is unlikely to be systematic.
