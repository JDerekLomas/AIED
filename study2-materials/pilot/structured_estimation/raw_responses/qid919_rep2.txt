Evaluating y = 3x^2 at x = 0.3. The student must substitute and compute correctly: 3 * (0.3)^2 = 3 * 0.09 = 0.27.

This item sits at the intersection of three skills: (1) substitution into a formula, (2) understanding order of operations with exponents, and (3) squaring a decimal. Any weakness in these areas could lead to errors.

The tested misconception—left-to-right computation ignoring operator precedence—would yield 3 * 0.3 = 0.9, then 0.9^2 = 0.81. Answer A captures this precisely.

Looking at the calibration anchor: the similar BIDMAS item (0.4 - 1/5 * 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and b = -0.245. That item was relatively easy. However, I think this target item is notably harder for several reasons:
1. Squaring a decimal (0.3^2 = 0.09) is non-trivial for many students
2. The multiplication by 3 combined with squaring creates confusion about order
3. All four answers are plausible decimal values, none obviously wrong

On the other hand, the table presentation makes the task very clear—there's no ambiguity about what's being asked. Students who know BIDMAS and can square decimals will find this straightforward.

I think this aligns roughly with the function machine item (classical difficulty 0.295, b = 0.002), perhaps slightly harder due to decimal computation. I'll estimate around 0.30 classical difficulty and b near 0.05.

For discrimination, order-of-operations items tend to discriminate well since they separate students who truly understand precedence rules from those who don't. I expect moderate-to-good discrimination around 1.2-1.4.
