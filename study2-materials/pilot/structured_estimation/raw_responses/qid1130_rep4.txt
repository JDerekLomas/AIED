Examining this item from a psychometric standpoint. The question asks students to find x where a triangle has angles 4x, 2x - 12, and 4x + 42.

Solution path: Sum of angles = 180 → 4x + 2x - 12 + 4x + 42 = 180 → 10x + 30 = 180 → 10x = 150 → x = 15 (option A).

The tested misconception (using same operation rather than inverse) would produce x = 21 (option D) if a student adds 30 rather than subtracting at the key step.

Let me think about this from a population perspective. In the UK secondary curriculum, the angle sum of triangles is introduced in Year 7 and reinforced through KS3. Forming and solving equations from geometric contexts is a staple of GCSE-level work. This is a very standard question type that appears frequently in textbook exercises and past papers.

Because of its familiarity, I might expect the difficulty to be somewhat lower than a novel presentation. Students who have practised this type of question will find it routine. The main source of difficulty is the algebraic manipulation—specifically, correctly collecting the constant terms (-12 + 42 = 30) and then performing the inverse operation.

Distractor mapping:
- D (x=21): Misconception target — add 30 instead of subtract → 10x = 210
- B (x=12.6): Likely from combining constants incorrectly as +54 or getting 10x = 126
- C (x=33): Perhaps from setting angles equal to 360 instead of 180, then 10x + 30 = 360 → 10x = 330 → x = 33. This is actually a quite plausible error — confusing triangle (180) with quadrilateral (360)!

With that realization, option C is quite a strong distractor for students who confuse angle sum rules. This means the item tests more than just inverse operations — it also catches students on angle sum knowledge.

Given the multiple potential error sources, I expect moderate difficulty. The standard presentation keeps transfer distance low. Comparing to calibration: the function machine item (b = 0.002, classical = 0.295) tested the same misconception in a less familiar context. This triangle item is more familiar but has more steps, so I'd estimate similar or slightly higher difficulty.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.33, IRT b around 0.05. Discrimination should be reasonable but perhaps not as high as pure algebra items since geometric knowledge errors can also contribute.
