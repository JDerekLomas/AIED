This item asks students to expand -5(m - 7). The correct answer is C: -5m + 35.

Let me analyze the mathematical content. The student needs to:
1. Multiply -5 by m to get -5m
2. Multiply -5 by -7 to get +35 (negative times negative = positive)

The misconception tested is "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer." This is a very common misconception. If a student makes this error on the second term, they'd get -5m - 35, which is option B.

Looking at the distractors:
- A: 5m + 35 -- sign error on first term (made -5 * m positive) but got second term right
- B: -5m - 35 -- the target misconception (negative * negative = negative)
- C: -5m + 35 -- CORRECT
- D: 5m - 35 -- both signs flipped, or possibly a different systematic error

Calibration against the anchors: The factorising item (Tom and Katie) also tests "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer" and has classical difficulty 0.473 and IRT b = 0.404. However, that item is more complex (requires factorising and checking two students' work). This item is more straightforward -- just expanding a single bracket. So it should be somewhat easier than that item.

However, the misconception about negative * negative is strong and this item directly targets it. The distractors are quite plausible. I'd estimate around 35-40% of students get this wrong.

For discrimination: The item cleanly separates students who understand sign rules from those who don't. Moderate-to-good discrimination expected, similar to the calibration items (~1.2-1.4).

The concept complexity is moderate -- it involves understanding of distribution and sign rules but is a single operation. Procedural steps are few (two multiplications). The question is very clear and standard.
