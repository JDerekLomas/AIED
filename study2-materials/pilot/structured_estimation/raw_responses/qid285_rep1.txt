Analyzing F = r * omega^2, rearrange for omega.

Step 1: Divide both sides by r -> omega^2 = F/r
Step 2: Square root both sides -> omega = sqrt(F/r)

Answer is B.

Let me consider what makes this item difficult. The key challenges are:
1. Students must recognize that r is multiplied by omega^2, so the inverse is division.
2. Students must then recognize that the inverse of squaring is square rooting.
3. The use of Greek letter omega and literal coefficients (no numbers) increases abstraction significantly.

Looking at the distractors more carefully:
- A (omega = rF^2): Very implausible for any student with basic algebra skills. This would only attract random guessers.
- C (omega = sqrt(rF)): This is the key misconception distractor. A student might multiply both sides by r (same operation) or simply fail to properly divide.
- D (omega = sqrt(F)/r): This is actually quite subtle — the student correctly identifies the need to square root but incorrectly handles the division. They might divide by r instead of dividing under the radical. This is a reasonable error.

Comparing with calibration set: The inequality item (b=0.808, classical=0.569) is the hardest calibration example. This rearranging item involves similar multi-step reasoning but with the added complexity of a squared term and no numerical values. I think it's slightly harder than the factorising item but comparable to the inequality.

One key difference from the calibration items is that this is a "change of subject" problem rather than a "solve for x with numbers" problem. Students often find change-of-subject harder because there are no numbers to check against.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.50, IRT b around 0.50. Discrimination moderate at ~1.15 because option A is weak. Guessing around 0.12.
