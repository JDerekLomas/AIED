The target item presents c divided by (h+4) and asks which fraction representation is correct. This tests whether students understand how division with brackets translates to fraction notation.

Answer A, c/(h+4), is the straightforward correct translation. The misconception being tested is "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order" -- distractor C (c/h + 4) embodies this misconception perfectly, where a student ignores the brackets and reads the expression sequentially: c divided by h, then add 4.

Distractor B adds 4 to both numerator and denominator, which might appeal to students who think the +4 needs to appear "everywhere." Distractor D flips the fraction entirely, a common error for students confused about which quantity is being divided by which.

Considering the cognitive demands: this is a translation task (symbolic to symbolic), not a computation. No numbers need to be manipulated. The main prerequisite is understanding that fraction bars act as grouping symbols and that c / (h+4) means c is the numerator and (h+4) is the denominator.

For calibration: the BIDMAS item testing the same misconception had classical difficulty 0.134, but that required actual arithmetic. This item is arguably even simpler since it's pure notation. However, the abstraction of using variables rather than numbers could make it slightly harder for some students. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.18.

The item should discriminate well -- it's a clean test of a specific concept. Low guessing since the correct answer is obvious once you know the convention.
