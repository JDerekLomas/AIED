Examining the item: Solve -3 = p + 12. The solution is p = -3 - 12 = -15 (option B).

This tests the same misconception as calibration items 1, 3, and 5: "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse." Having three calibration items with this exact misconception gives me strong anchoring data.

Calibration item 1 is the most structurally similar (simple one-step equation with p): difficulty 0.167, b = -0.702, a = 1.324, c = 0.000.
Calibration item 3 (function machine, squaring): difficulty 0.295, b = 0.002 -- but this involves more complex operations.
Calibration item 5 (inequality with variable on both sides): difficulty 0.569, b = 0.808 -- much harder due to multi-step nature.

So for a simple one-step equation like this, difficulty should be low, close to calibration item 1.

However, I want to consider whether the negative constant on the left (-3 = ...) might trip up more students than the calibration item (-5 = p + 10). The equation is presented in a slightly non-standard form (constant = variable expression rather than variable expression = constant), which could add a small amount of confusion. But the calibration item 1 also has this same non-standard form, so it's a wash.

The distractors are well-constructed. Option A (p = 9) directly captures the target misconception. Option C (p = -9) captures a related sign error. Option D (p = 15) captures students who ignore the negative sign. These are plausible errors but for a relatively able student body, this should remain easy.

I'll predict parameters very close to calibration item 1 but allow for slight variation.
