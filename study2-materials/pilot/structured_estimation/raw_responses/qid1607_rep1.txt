Let me analyze this item about evaluating Isaac's equation-solving steps for 15 = (1+k)/4.

The equation solving:
- Correct approach: multiply both sides by 4 → 60 = 1 + k, then subtract 1 → k = 59.
- Isaac's Step 1: 60 = 1 + k. Correct — he properly multiplied by 4.
- Isaac's Step 2: 61 = k. Incorrect — he added 1 instead of subtracting 1. This is the classic "same operation instead of inverse" misconception.

Answer: A (Only Step 1 is correct).

Difficulty considerations: This is a "spot the error" format rather than "solve it yourself." Students need to understand equation solving well enough to judge each step independently. Some students might rush and pick C (both correct) because the numbers seem plausible — 61 is close to 59 and both "feel right" if you're not careful. The question format adds a layer of metacognition.

Comparing with anchor items: The simple equation p + 10 = -5 had difficulty 0.167. The factoring evaluation item (Tom and Katie) had difficulty 0.473 — that also required evaluating others' work but with more complex algebra. This item sits somewhere between — simpler math than factoring but same evaluative format.

The discrimination should be moderate to good — students who understand inverse operations will reliably get this right, while those who don't will be drawn to C or B. The misconception (same operation vs inverse) is one of the most pervasive in algebra instruction.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.35, IRT b around 0.05.
