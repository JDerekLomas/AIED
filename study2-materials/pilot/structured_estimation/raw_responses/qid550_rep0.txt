Let me analyze this item about order of operations, where Tom and Katie each make a claim about equivalence.

Tom says: 3+2-1 = 3-1+2. Let me check: LHS = 3+2-1 = 4. RHS = 3-1+2 = 4. Both equal 4. Addition and subtraction are at the same level of precedence and are commutative in the sense that reordering addends (treating subtraction as adding a negative) preserves the result. So Tom is correct.

Katie says: 3+2x1 = 2x1+3. LHS = 3+2x1 = 3+2 = 5. RHS = 2x1+3 = 2+3 = 5. Both equal 5. Katie is also correct - she's just rearranging terms where multiplication has already been performed first by BODMAS/BIDMAS rules.

So the correct answer is C (Both Tom and Katie).

Now, the misconception tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." A student with this misconception might evaluate Katie's expressions differently. However, in this particular case, even doing left-to-right gives the same result for Tom's statement (3+2-1=4 either way). For Katie: left-to-right on LHS gives (3+2)x1=5, and left-to-right on RHS gives (2x1)+3=5. Wait - actually left-to-right on the LHS: 3+2=5, then 5x1=5. And RHS: 2x1=2, then 2+3=5. So even with the misconception, both sides equal 5.

Hmm, but the misconception is about order of operations. Let me reconsider. The question is whether students recognize that Katie's statement is valid. A student who does operations left-to-right might think Katie is rearranging incorrectly because they don't understand that multiplication takes priority. They might think 3+2x1 means (3+2)x1=5 and 2x1+3 means (2x1)+3=5, and coincidentally get the right answer. Or they might think the order matters and say Katie is wrong because she "moved things around."

Actually, the trickier interpretation: some students might think that because the operations must be done left-to-right, you can't rearrange terms. They might say Tom is correct (since addition and subtraction go left-to-right and the result happens to work) but Katie is wrong (because they think rearranging around a multiplication changes the answer). This would lead them to answer A.

This is a relatively easy item. The math itself is simple arithmetic. The challenge is understanding commutativity and order of operations conceptually. Since the numbers are small and the operations straightforward, most students should get this right.

Comparing to calibration examples: the BODMAS item (0.4 - 1/5 x 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245. That item required actual computation with fractions and decimals. This item is simpler - just verifying two equalities with small whole numbers. But the "who is correct" format adds some cognitive load (similar to the Tom and Katie factoring item with difficulty 0.473).

However, in this case the numbers are much simpler than the factoring item. I'd estimate this is easier than the factoring one but perhaps slightly harder than the simple equation-solving items because of the conceptual "who is correct" framing.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.25-0.35, IRT difficulty around -0.1 to 0.2.
