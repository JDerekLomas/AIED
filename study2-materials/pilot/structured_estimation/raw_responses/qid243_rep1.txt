Analyzing: 3n + 2 >= 4n - 5, correct answer C: 7 >= n.

The solution requires collecting variable terms on one side and constants on the other. This involves understanding inverse operations — precisely the misconception being tested. A student who "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" might, for instance, when trying to move +2 to the right side, add 2 instead of subtracting it, yielding an incorrect result.

Let me trace through each distractor to understand what errors produce them:
- C (correct): 3n + 2 >= 4n - 5 → 2 + 5 >= 4n - 3n → 7 >= n
- A (-3 >= n): Could arise from 2 - 5 = -3 and 4n - 3n = n, meaning the student subtracted 5 instead of adding it (same operation as it appears, not inverse). This directly tests the stated misconception.
- B (1 >= n): Possibly from 3 - 2 = 1 on the coefficients, or some other confusion.
- D (n >= 7): The student gets the right numbers but flips the inequality direction or rearranges to put n first without adjusting the sign.

Distractor A is the "misconception distractor" — it directly results from using the same operation rather than inverse on the constant term. Distractor D is also very attractive because many students prefer to write the variable on the left.

The closest calibration anchor is the inequality item 2n + 3 <= 3n - 7, with classical difficulty 0.569 and b = 0.808. This target item is structurally identical. However, the numbers here are slightly simpler (smaller constants, cleaner arithmetic). I might expect it to be slightly easier but still in a similar range.

One consideration: distractor D (n >= 7) might be particularly tempting because students who solve correctly but then rewrite with n on the left may forget to flip the inequality symbol. This adds an extra source of error beyond the primary misconception.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.55, slightly below the anchor, and IRT difficulty around 0.70.
