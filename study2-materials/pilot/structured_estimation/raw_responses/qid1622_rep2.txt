Analyzing this item: students must find y when x=0 for the equation 3x + 2y = 6, presented in a table-of-values format.

Step 1: Recognize that the star is in the y-row under x=0.
Step 2: Substitute x=0 into 3(0) + 2y = 6.
Step 3: Simplify to 2y = 6.
Step 4: Solve y = 3.

The substitution of x=0 is the simplest possible case since it eliminates the first term entirely. This makes the item essentially just "solve 2y = 6."

Distractor analysis:
- D=12: This is 2*6, applying multiplication instead of division (the tested misconception). This is a strong distractor for students who don't understand inverse operations.
- B=2: Could come from just reading the coefficient, or computing 6/3 (using wrong coefficient).
- C=1.5: Could be 3/2, mixing up numbers.

The item is relatively easy but the table presentation adds interpretive demand. Some students might struggle with understanding what the table means rather than with the algebra itself.

Looking at calibration anchors, this feels close to the first item (difficulty 0.167) but the table format and need to interpret context might push it slightly higher. The BODMAS item had 0.134 difficulty but much higher discrimination. I think this item would have moderate difficulty around 0.20.

For discrimination, the item should separate well — it's a clean test of whether students can substitute and solve. I'll estimate around 1.30.

Guessing should be low since students who don't know the answer will likely gravitate toward specific distractors rather than guess randomly.
