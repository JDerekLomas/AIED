This item requires students to find the gradient of a line given in standard form (5x + 3y = 15). To solve correctly, students must rearrange to slope-intercept form: subtract 5x from both sides to get 3y = -5x + 15, then divide by 3 to get y = (-5/3)x + 5. The gradient is -5/3.

The misconception tested is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse." This manifests here when a student fails to properly handle the sign change when moving 5x to the other side. Instead of subtracting 5x (getting -5x), they might keep it positive, arriving at 5/3 (distractor C). Alternatively, students who just read off the coefficient of x without rearranging get 5 (distractor A), and those who recognize the sign change but forget to divide by 3 get -5 (distractor B).

Comparing to calibration items: The equation-solving items range from classical difficulty 0.167 to 0.569. This item involves multiple concepts -- linear equations, gradient/slope, rearranging to y=mx+c form -- making it moderately challenging. The distractors are quite plausible since each represents a common partial error. I'd place this around 0.45-0.55 classical difficulty, comparable to the factorising item (0.473) but possibly slightly harder since it combines algebraic manipulation with understanding of gradient.

The item requires prerequisite knowledge of what gradient means, how to rearrange equations, and the y=mx+c form. It has moderate procedural steps (rearrange, divide, identify coefficient). The question itself is clearly stated. The discrimination should be reasonable since it tests genuine understanding rather than rote application.
