Item: 2 1/5 + 1 2/5, answer as mixed number. Correct: A (3 3/5).

This is a basic mixed number addition problem where denominators match. The procedure is simply: add whole parts, add fraction parts. No carrying or simplification needed since 3/5 < 1.

Key consideration: how hard is this really? The denominators are already the same, which removes the most difficult step in fraction addition. Students who have any reasonable understanding of fractions should get this right. The main trap is the misconception of adding denominators.

Distractor analysis:
- D (3 3/10) is the most plausible wrong answer for the tested misconception -- it looks very close to the correct answer but with denominator 10 instead of 5.
- B (18/5) catches students who compute correctly but don't convert to mixed number form.
- C (18/10) catches students who both convert to improper fractions AND add denominators.

I think this item is quite easy. The like denominators make it nearly trivial for students who have basic fraction knowledge. Looking at the calibration set, items with classical difficulty 0.13-0.17 were straightforward one-step problems. This is similarly easy, perhaps even easier since fraction addition with like denominators is very basic.

However, I should consider that fraction misconceptions are deeply ingrained. Even with like denominators, some students may add them. And the "leave as mixed number" instruction adds a small additional hurdle.

My estimate: classical difficulty around 0.18-0.22. Many students will get this right.

IRT parameters: difficulty around -0.5 (easier than average), discrimination around 1.1-1.3 (decent but not exceptional since it's quite easy and may not differentiate well among higher-ability students), guessing near 0 since the correct answer is clear.
