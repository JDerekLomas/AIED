This item asks students to rearrange the area formula A = (1/2)(b x h) to make h the subject. Let me work through the solution and analyze the distractors.

To isolate h:
1. Multiply both sides by 2: 2A = b x h
2. Divide both sides by b: h = 2A/b

So the correct answer is B.

Now let me examine the distractors:
- Option A: h = (1/2)(b x A). This looks like the student simply swapped h and A in the original formula without performing any inverse operations. This directly tests the misconception of using the same operation rather than the inverse.
- Option C: h = A/(2b). This is what you'd get if you divided by 2 instead of multiplying by 2 -- again using the same operation (dividing by 2) rather than the inverse (multiplying by 2).
- Option D: "They are all incorrect" -- a catch-all distractor.

Comparing to the calibration items: The calibration set includes several items testing this same misconception ("uses the same operation rather than the inverse") at varying difficulties. The equation-solving item (-5 = p+10) was easy (classical difficulty 0.167). The function machine item was moderate (0.295). The inequality item was harder (0.569).

This formula rearrangement item involves algebraic manipulation with a fraction (1/2), which adds complexity compared to simple one-step equations. The presence of the fraction means students need to handle both multiplication and division inversions. The distractors are quite plausible -- option C in particular represents a very common error. I'd place this item as moderately difficult, similar to or slightly above the factorising item (0.473) in the calibration set.

The discrimination should be reasonable since the distractors map to specific misconceptions, though option D might attract some random guessing. I'd estimate moderate discrimination around 1.2-1.3.
