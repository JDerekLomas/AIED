Analyzing this item: students must identify that multiplying -8 by -2 gives +16 when expanding (x-8)(x-2).

The key challenge is the sign rule for multiplying two negative numbers. This is a well-documented misconception -- many students believe that negative times negative gives a negative result.

Distractor analysis:
- A) -10: addition error (-8 + -2 = -10)
- B) +16: correct
- C) -6: unclear origin, maybe |-8| - |-2| = 6 with negative sign, or subtraction confusion
- D) -16: the target misconception -- magnitude correct but sign wrong

The question uses a visual diagram with arrows, which is somewhat non-standard compared to just asking "what is (-8) x (-2)?" This contextualizes it within bracket expansion, which is important for ecological validity but might add confusion for weaker students who aren't sure what operation the arrows indicate.

The same misconception appeared in the Tom/Katie calibration item (difficulty 0.473, b=0.404, a=1.451, c=0.186). That item had more layers -- students needed to expand two different quadratics and compare. This item strips it down to just one multiplication step within expansion.

However, I want to consider that the visual/contextual framing might make this harder than a bare arithmetic question. Students need to: (1) understand the bracket expansion context, (2) identify that the arrows mean "multiply these terms," (3) apply the sign rule correctly. Some students might not even realize multiplication is what's needed.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.40-0.45. The misconception is strong and the contextual framing adds difficulty. The discrimination should be solid since this tests a specific skill. Given the strong pull of distractor D, guessing should be low -- wrong students will be systematically drawn to D.
