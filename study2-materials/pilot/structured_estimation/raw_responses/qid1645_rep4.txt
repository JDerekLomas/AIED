Solving 3p^2 + 9 = 39 requires three inverse operations ending in a surd answer p = +/- sqrt(10).

I want to anchor my estimates carefully against the calibration items. The key reference points:
- Simple linear equation (-5=p+10): b=-0.702, 16.7% incorrect. Very easy.
- Order of operations (0.4 - 1/5 x 3): b=-0.245, 13.4% incorrect. Easy but requires BODMAS.
- Function machine (x^2+5=14): b=0.002, 29.5% incorrect. Medium -- involves reversing operations with a square.
- Factorising (Tom and Katie): b=0.404, 47.3% incorrect. Medium-hard, conceptual.
- Inequality (2n+3 <= 3n-7): b=0.808, 56.9% incorrect. Hard, multi-step.

This target item is closest to the function machine item (also involves reversing operations with a square) but harder because: (1) three operations instead of two, (2) the answer is irrational sqrt(10) rather than a clean integer, (3) no visual scaffolding (function machine diagrams help structure thinking).

The function machine item was b=0.002 at 29.5% incorrect. Adding the extra step, removing visual scaffolding, and introducing surds should push difficulty considerably higher. I'd estimate somewhere between the factorising and inequality items.

Classical difficulty: I'll estimate about 0.50-0.55. The surd answer is the main difficulty driver -- students who correctly reach p^2=10 may not recognize sqrt(10) as valid, or may make arithmetic errors along the way.

IRT difficulty: Given the calibration, I'd place this around b=0.55, between factorising (0.404) and inequality (0.808).

Discrimination: The item has clear, misconception-driven distractors (especially D for same-operation error, C for wrong-order error). This should produce good discrimination. However, option A with the wrong variable is a bit odd and doesn't cleanly map to a misconception, which might slightly reduce overall item quality. I estimate a ~ 1.30.

Guessing: The wrong variable in option A makes it somewhat eliminable. With effectively 3 plausible options for less knowledgeable students, guessing is around 1/3 * (probability of pure guessing). I'd set c ~ 0.15, accounting for partial elimination.
