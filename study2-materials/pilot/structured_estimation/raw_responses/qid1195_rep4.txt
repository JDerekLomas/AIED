Target: 2 x 3^2 = ?  Correct: A (18). Misconception: left-to-right processing ignoring operator precedence.

Step-by-step correct solution: 3^2 = 9, then 2 x 9 = 18. Just two operations.

Let me think about each distractor's appeal:
- C = 36: (2x3)^2 = 36. This is the misconception-driven answer. Very attractive because 36 is a perfect square and "feels right" -- it's bigger, which might match students' intuition that squaring should give a big answer.
- B = 12: Perhaps 2 x 3 x 2 = 12. Or maybe 2 x 6 = 12 where they computed 3x2=6 for "3 squared." Moderate plausibility.
- D = 11: 2 + 9 = 11. Misreading multiplication as addition. Low plausibility for most students but catches careless errors.

I want to think about this from a population perspective. UK secondary students ages 11-16 is a wide range. Year 7 students would find this challenging; Year 10-11 students would find it trivial. The overall difficulty depends heavily on the age distribution in the sample.

For a diagnostic assessment given across the full 11-16 range, I'd expect:
- Year 7 (age 11-12): maybe 40-50% incorrect
- Year 8 (age 12-13): maybe 20-30% incorrect
- Year 9+ (age 13+): maybe 10-15% incorrect

Weighted average across years, assuming roughly equal representation: approximately 20-25% incorrect overall.

The calibration BODMAS item was 13.4% incorrect, but that item's student sample might skew older given the fraction/decimal content. If I assume similar sampling for this item, the simpler numbers might attract a younger cohort, pushing difficulty up slightly.

I'll estimate classical difficulty at 0.23, IRT difficulty at -0.30. Discrimination should be good -- around 1.2-1.4 -- since it's a clean single-concept item. Guessing parameter should be quite low since the distractors are well-targeted to specific errors rather than inviting random selection.
