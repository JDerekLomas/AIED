This item presents 10x - 6y = 30 in a table format where y = 0.5 and students must find x (the star).

Working through it:
10x - 6(0.5) = 30
10x - 3 = 30
10x = 33
x = 3.3

The correct answer is C.

Let me think about what makes this item interesting psychometrically. The table-of-values presentation is a somewhat unusual format for what is essentially a substitution-and-solve problem. Students need to recognize that the table gives a coordinate pair satisfying the equation, then perform the algebraic work.

Key difficulty factors:
1. Reading comprehension of the table format - students must understand that the star represents x when y = 0.5
2. Substitution - plugging 0.5 into the equation for y
3. Decimal multiplication - computing 6 * 0.5 = 3
4. Two-step equation solving - adding 3 then dividing by 10

The misconception tested is "uses same operation rather than inverse." Distractor D (2.7) perfectly captures this: a student who gets 10x - 3 = 30 and then subtracts 3 from both sides (same operation) gets 10x = 27, x = 2.7.

For distractor A (4.25), one pathway: if a student does 10x = 6(0.5) + 30 = 33, that gives 3.3 (correct). Maybe they compute 6/0.5 = 12 instead of 6*0.5, giving 10x - 12 = 30, 10x = 42, x = 4.2... close but not 4.25. Or perhaps 10x = 30 + 6 + 6*0.5 = 39 + 3.5 = 42.5, x = 4.25. This is a more confused approach.

Comparing to calibration items, this seems to be of moderate-to-hard difficulty. The multi-step nature and decimal computation push it beyond simple equation solving. I'd place it around the factorising item in difficulty (b ~ 0.4, p ~ 0.47) or slightly harder given the multiple skills required.

However, the problem is relatively straightforward if you know what to do - substitute and solve. Strong students should find it easy. This suggests decent discrimination.
