Analyzing the target item: students must find y when x = 0.3 in the equation 2x + 3y = 12. The procedure is: substitute to get 0.6 + 3y = 12, rearrange to 3y = 11.4, divide to get y = 3.8.

The key misconception tested — using the same operation rather than the inverse — maps directly to distractor C (4.2), where a student adds 0.6 instead of subtracting: 12 + 0.6 = 12.6, 12.6/3 = 4.2. This is a very common error in equation solving.

What makes this item interesting is the table-of-values presentation. Students accustomed to seeing "solve for y" may be slightly thrown by the table format, though it's a standard curriculum element. The decimal value x = 0.3 adds computational complexity — students must correctly compute 2 × 0.3 = 0.6 before proceeding.

Thinking about the difficulty level: looking at the calibration set, the simplest equation (p + 10 = -5, essentially one-step) has classical difficulty 0.167. The most complex (inequality with variables on both sides) has 0.569. This target item requires substitution, multiplication of a decimal, subtraction, and division — roughly 4 procedural steps. The decimal arithmetic is not trivial for weaker students but is manageable for most KS3/KS4 students.

I think difficulty falls in the 0.35-0.45 range. The equation itself is not conceptually hard — it's a standard linear equation once x is substituted — but the combination of decimals and multiple steps will trip up a fair number of students. Discrimination should be solid because each distractor captures a distinct error pattern. Guessing should be low since answers require calculation.
