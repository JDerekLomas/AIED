The expression is 12 / 2 + 1 x 2. Applying BIDMAS correctly: division and multiplication first (left to right within that tier), so 12/2 = 6 and 1x2 = 2, then addition: 6+2 = 8. Answer D is correct.

The key misconception is left-to-right processing ignoring operator precedence. Following strict left-to-right: 12/2=6, 6+1=7, 7x2=14, yielding distractor C. This is a well-known and persistent misconception even among older students.

Let me think about the other distractors. Answer A (9) might arise from computing 12/(2+1) = 4, then 4+... no, that gives 4. Or perhaps adding all numbers: 12+2+1+2 with some operation confusion? It's not an obvious error path. Answer B (3) could arise from 12/(2+1+2-1) type grouping, also unclear. These weaker distractors mean most errors will cluster on C.

Comparing to the calibration anchor for the same misconception (classical difficulty 0.134, IRT b = -0.245): that item involved 0.4 - 1/5 x 3 with fraction-decimal conversion, making it arguably more complex computationally. This item is pure integers, so should be at least as easy or possibly slightly harder because the left-to-right path here produces a "clean" answer (14) that looks right, whereas the calibration item's misconception path gives 0.6 which might feel wrong to some students.

I'll estimate classical difficulty slightly higher than the anchor, around 0.18, and IRT difficulty around -0.30. Good discrimination expected since the item cleanly targets one misconception.
