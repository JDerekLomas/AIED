This question tests whether students can identify a counter-example for the claim that 2n^2 - 1 is always positive. Let me think about what makes this hard or easy.

First, the concept of "counter-example" itself is somewhat advanced -- it belongs to mathematical reasoning/proof, typically covered at GCSE level. Students need to know that a single case where the expression is not positive disproves the claim.

Computing each option:
B: 2(0.5)^2 - 1 = 2(0.25) - 1 = -0.5. This is negative, so it's the correct counter-example.
A: 2(0.75)^2 - 1 = 2(0.5625) - 1 = 0.125. Positive but close to zero -- a tricky distractor.
C: 2(4) - 1 = 7. Clearly positive.
D: 2(1) - 1 = 1. Positive.

Students with the "two negatives" misconception will incorrectly compute C as 2(-4) - 1 = -9 and D as 2(-1) - 1 = -3, making both look like strong counter-examples. Since -9 looks more dramatic than -3, I'd expect C to be the most popular wrong answer.

However, there's another possible error path: students who struggle with decimal/fraction arithmetic might miscalculate A or B. Option A with its fraction (3/4) adds arithmetic complexity.

Considering the calibration anchors, the inequality item (classical 0.569, b = 0.808) is quite hard. I think this item is in a similar range -- the counter-example concept plus the multiple computations plus the misconception trap make it challenging. But the computations themselves are not as algebraically demanding as solving inequalities, so perhaps slightly easier.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.54 and b around 0.60. The discrimination should be moderate -- the misconception creates a clean separation between students who understand squaring and those who don't, but the multiple error paths might dilute it slightly.
