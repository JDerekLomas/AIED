This item asks students to identify the inverse operation needed to solve x - 7 = ... by moving from the top line to the bottom line. The correct answer is +7, which is the inverse of -7. This is a very straightforward question testing whether students understand that to undo subtraction, you add.

Looking at the calibration items, the first calibration item tests the same misconception ("uses the same operation rather than the inverse") with the equation -5 = p + 10, and has a classical difficulty of 0.167 and IRT b of -0.702. That item requires actually solving for p, whereas this target item is more conceptual/procedural -- it just asks what operation to apply, with the working already shown. This makes the target item arguably easier since the student doesn't need to compute anything; they just need to recognize the inverse of subtraction.

However, the presentation involves a visual element (the function machine-style working with a star), which adds a small layer of interpretation. The distractor D (-7) directly tests the misconception of using the same operation. Distractors B and C (multiply and divide by 7) are less plausible for students who understand the context but might catch students who are confused about operations in general.

Comparing to calibration item 1 (b = -0.702, classical difficulty 0.167): This target item is simpler because no computation is needed. I'd estimate it to be slightly easier or comparable. The misconception is common but the item format makes it quite transparent.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.12-0.18, IRT difficulty around -0.9 to -0.5, good discrimination since the misconception is targeted well, and low guessing since students either know inverse operations or they don't (though some may guess +7 because it "feels right").
