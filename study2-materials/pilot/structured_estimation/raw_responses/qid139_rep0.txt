This item asks students to multiply (-4) x (-3) in the context of expanding brackets (5p-4)(2p-3). The correct answer is +12 (C), since multiplying two negatives yields a positive.

Looking at the calibration examples, I note the factorising item (Tom and Katie) tests the same misconception ("believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer") and has classical difficulty 0.473, IRT b=0.404, a=1.451, c=0.186.

However, this target item is more straightforward. The Tom/Katie item required students to factorise and then check both students' work, involving more cognitive steps. Here, the arrows explicitly point to the two terms, so the student just needs to compute (-4)x(-3). The main trap is option B (-12), which students with the misconception would choose.

That said, this item is embedded in an algebraic context (expanding brackets), and the visual/diagram component adds some complexity. Students need to understand that the terms carry their signs. Some students might also be confused about whether the answer should include a p term, but all options are constants, so that's mitigated.

Comparing to the calibration set: the equation-solving items with classical difficulty ~0.17-0.57 span easy to moderate. This item tests a common misconception but in a relatively direct way. I'd estimate it's moderately difficult - perhaps slightly easier than the Tom/Katie item since it's more direct, but the bracket expansion context and visual element add challenge.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.40-0.45, IRT difficulty around 0.25-0.35, good discrimination since the misconception cleanly separates those who know the rule from those who don't, and moderate guessing since -12 is very attractive to those with the misconception but random guessing is less likely.
