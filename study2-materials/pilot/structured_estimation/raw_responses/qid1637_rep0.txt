This item requires solving a compound (double) inequality: -3 < 2x + 1 < 7. The student must subtract 1 from all three parts to get -4 < 2x < 6, then divide all three parts by 2 to get -2 < x < 3 (answer A).

The misconception tested is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse." A student making this error might add 1 instead of subtracting, yielding -2 < 2x < 8, then dividing by 2 gives -1 < x < 4 -- but that's not among the options. Alternatively they might multiply by 2 instead of dividing, getting -8 < x < 12, also not listed. Let me look at the distractors more carefully:

- B) -1 < x < 3: This could come from subtracting 1 only from the left side (-3-1=-4... no). Actually -1 < x < 3 could come from subtracting 1 from -3 incorrectly (getting -2) then dividing by 2 to get -1, while doing the right side correctly. Or adding 1 to -3 to get -2 then dividing by 2 to get -1. This is plausible for the tested misconception on one side.
- C) -0.5 < x < 2.5: This looks like dividing everything by 2 first without subtracting 1: -3/2 = -1.5... no, -0.5 would be (-3+1)/4? Actually -0.5 = (-3-(-2))/2... Let me reconsider. If you subtract 1 correctly: -4 < 2x < 6, but then halve incorrectly... no. Perhaps: (-3-1)/2 = -2 vs (-3+1)/2 = -1... Actually C might come from subtracting 1 from -3 to get -4, dividing -4 by 2 = -2... no that gives -2. Hmm. Maybe C comes from a different error path.
- D) -5 < x < 15: This looks like multiplying by 2 instead of dividing -- from -4 < 2x < 6, multiply by 2: -8 < x < 12... no. Or maybe from the original -3 < 2x+1 < 7, subtract 1: -4 < 2x < 6, then multiply by 2 instead of divide: -8 and 12, still not matching. Perhaps D = -3-2 = -5, 7+2*4 = 15? Not obvious. D seems less plausible.

Comparing to calibration items: The compound inequality is notably harder than a single-step equation (calibration item 1, difficulty 0.167) and somewhat comparable to the inequality in calibration item 5 (difficulty 0.569) but adds the compound element. I'd estimate this is moderately difficult -- probably around 0.45-0.55 proportion incorrect.

The compound inequality format is fairly standard for GCSE-level content. The procedural demands are moderate: two operations applied across three expressions. The misconception of using same operation instead of inverse is well-known and commonly tested. Distractor B is quite plausible for students who partially apply the inverse incorrectly.
