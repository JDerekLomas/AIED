The target item requires adding 3/5 + 1/4. To solve correctly, a student must find the lowest common denominator (20), convert 3/5 to 12/20 and 1/4 to 5/20, then add to get 17/20.

The tested misconception - adding numerators and denominators separately - is one of the most robust and well-documented misconceptions in mathematics education. Students who do 3+1=4 and 5+4=9 get option A (4/9).

Let me think about difficulty. Fraction addition with unlike denominators is typically introduced around Year 7 (age 11-12) in the UK curriculum, so it spans the full age range. However, this misconception persists even into later years.

Looking at distractor analysis more carefully:
- A) 4/9 is the primary misconception trap
- B) 4/20 suggests a student found the common denominator but only added numerators without converting (3+1=4, denominator=20)
- C) 7/20 could come from adding 3+4=7 (treating the 4 from 1/4's denominator as a numerator?) with denominator 20
- D) 17/20 correct

The distractors are well-designed with A being highly attractive. Given that this is a fundamental skill with a strong misconception, I expect moderate difficulty. The visual presentation with circles is slightly non-standard but not confusing.

Calibrating against the examples: this feels similar in difficulty to the function machine item (0.295) or slightly harder, since fraction misconceptions are deeply ingrained. I'll estimate around 0.35 proportion incorrect.

For IRT discrimination, the clean separation between the misconception and correct procedure should yield decent discrimination, maybe around 1.2-1.4.
