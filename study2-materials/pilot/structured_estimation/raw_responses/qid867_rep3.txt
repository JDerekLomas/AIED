This item tests whether students can correctly expand (x-4)^2. The correct answer is A: x^2 - 8x + 16.

I want to think carefully about where this sits in the UK curriculum. Expanding double brackets is typically introduced in Year 9/10 and is a key GCSE topic. Squaring a binomial is a special case that students encounter frequently. However, research consistently shows that students make systematic errors with squared binomials — the most common being the "missing middle term" error where students write (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2.

Let me consider the attractiveness of each distractor from a student's perspective:
- B (x^2 + 16): Very attractive. Students who think "square each part" land here. This might be the most commonly chosen wrong answer.
- C (x^2 - 16): Also attractive. Students who confuse squaring with difference of two squares, or who "square each part" but keep the negative sign.
- D (x^2 - 8x - 16): Attractive to students who correctly expand the middle term but make the sign error on (-4)^2. This is the tested misconception.

Given that there are THREE plausible distractors each targeting a real misconception, I expect this to be harder than it appears at first glance. Many students who partially understand expansion will still get caught by one of these traps.

The comparable calibration item (Tom/Katie factorising, same misconception category) had difficulty 0.473. But that item only really had one strong distractor. With three strong distractors here, I'd push difficulty slightly higher — perhaps 0.55.

For discrimination: the item should discriminate well because it requires complete understanding of binomial expansion. Partial knowledge leads to specific wrong answers. I estimate a = 1.2 to 1.4.

For guessing: with such plausible distractors, below-chance guessing is possible for weaker students (they're drawn to wrong answers), so the effective guessing parameter should be low, perhaps 0.05-0.15.
