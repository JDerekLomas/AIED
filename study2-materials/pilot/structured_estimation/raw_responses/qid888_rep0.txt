This item asks students to expand (m-5)(m-7) using the distributive property (FOIL). The correct expansion is m² - 7m - 5m + 35 = m² - 12m + 35 (answer B).

The misconception tested is "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer." A student with this misconception would compute (-5)×(-7) = -35 instead of +35, leading them to answer D: m² - 12m - 35, or possibly A: m² - 2m - 35 if they also make an error combining the middle terms.

Looking at the calibration item testing the same misconception (Tom and Katie factorising problem), that had classical difficulty 0.473 and IRT b = 0.404. However, the factorising problem required an additional layer of reasoning (evaluating two students' claims and checking signs in factored form). This expanding brackets item is more direct — students just need to apply FOIL — so it should be somewhat easier.

That said, the sign error misconception is very common, particularly when both brackets contain subtraction. Many students will get the first three terms right but fail on (-5)(-7). The distractors are well-constructed: A has both a middle-term error and the sign error, C has the wrong sign on the middle term, D has only the sign error on the constant. D is the most plausible distractor since it captures exactly the tested misconception.

I'd estimate this is moderately difficult — easier than the factorising calibration item but harder than the simple equation solving items. Classical difficulty around 0.40, IRT b around 0.25.
