The target item is 1/3 + 1/4 + 2/3 + 3/4. Correct answer is C (2).

Let me think about how students approach this. The efficient method: notice complementary pairs 1/3+2/3=1 and 1/4+3/4=1, total=2. The procedural method: LCD=12, convert to 4/12+3/12+8/12+9/12=24/12=2. Both paths lead to 2.

The tested misconception is adding numerators and denominators. If a student does 1+1+2+3=7 for numerators and 3+4+3+4=14 for denominators, they get 7/14, which is answer B. This is a well-known and persistent misconception.

Answer A (7/12): This could arise from adding numerators (7) over a partial common denominator (12), perhaps only considering two of the denominators. Answer D (28/12): Could come from correctly finding LCD=12 but making computational errors with the numerators, perhaps doubling something.

Comparing to calibration: the factorising question (Tom and Katie) had classical difficulty 0.473 and tests a conceptual misconception. This fraction item tests a procedural misconception that's arguably more common at younger ages. However, fraction addition with four terms and mixed denominators creates real cognitive load.

I think this is moderately difficult. The four-term addition increases working memory demands. Many students in the 11-16 range still struggle with fraction addition. I'd put classical difficulty around 0.35. The item should discriminate well because the pairing insight separates strong from weak students nicely.
