The target item presents -3 = p + 12. To solve, subtract 12 from both sides: p = -3 - 12 = -15, which is option B.

Looking at the distractors through the lens of student errors:
- A) p = 9: The student adds rather than subtracts, computing -3 + 12 = 9. This directly reflects the tested misconception of using the same operation rather than the inverse.
- C) p = -9: Possibly from computing 12 - 3 = 9 and then making it negative, or from a sign error in the subtraction.
- D) p = 15: The student ignores the negative sign on -3 entirely, computing 3 + 12 = 15.

This is nearly a direct clone of calibration item 1 (-5 = p + 10). That item had classical difficulty 0.167, IRT b = -0.702, discrimination a = 1.324, and guessing c = 0.000. The structural similarity is very strong, so I expect comparable parameters.

One consideration: the number 12 is slightly larger than 10, and -3 is closer to zero than -5, which might make the subtraction -3 - 12 = -15 require a tiny bit more care with negative arithmetic. But this is marginal.

For discrimination, the item should discriminate well because the correct answer requires proper understanding of inverse operations with negative numbers. However, distractor C (p = -9) might catch some mid-ability students who partially understand but make arithmetic errors, which could slightly lower discrimination.

I'll estimate this as slightly easier than the calibration item 1 overall, since the equation structure is transparent and the format is very standard.
