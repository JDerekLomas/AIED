This item requires students to substitute x = -1 into the quadratic y = x² - 2x + 1. The correct calculation is: (-1)² - 2(-1) + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 (option B).

The misconception tested is "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer." If a student thinks (-1)² = -1 instead of +1, they would compute -1 - 2(-1) + 1. If they then correctly handle -2(-1) = +2, they get -1 + 2 + 1 = 2 (option C). If they also mishandle -2(-1) as -2, they get -1 - 2 + 1 = -2 (option A).

Looking at the calibration examples: the factorising item testing the same misconception had classical difficulty 0.473 and IRT b = 0.404. That item required understanding factorisation which is arguably more conceptually demanding. However, this substitution item involves multiple negative number operations in sequence, which creates several opportunities for error.

The distractors are quite plausible — each corresponds to a specific computational error pattern. Option A (-2) results from squaring the negative incorrectly AND mishandling the double negative in -2(-1). Option C (2) comes from just the squaring error. Option D (0) could come from students who recognize x²-2x+1 = (x-1)² but then compute (-1-1)² incorrectly or substitute x=1 by mistake.

This is a mid-level difficulty item. The procedural demands are moderate — three terms to evaluate, two involving negative numbers. I'd estimate this is slightly easier than the factorising item since substitution is a more practiced skill than evaluating factorisations, but the multiple negative operations will trip up many students.
