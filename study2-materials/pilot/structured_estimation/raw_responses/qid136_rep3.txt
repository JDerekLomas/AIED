This item tests whether students understand that the product of two negative numbers is positive, not negative. The correct answer is B: (-4)(6) = -24.

Breaking down the distractors:
- A: (-3)(-8) = +24. This is the main trap. Students who think negative times negative equals negative will pick this because 3 x 8 = 24 and both numbers are negative.
- C: (-10)(-14) = +140. Very weak distractor -- wrong magnitude and wrong sign reasoning.
- D: (-3)(9) = -27. Plausible if a student doesn't check the arithmetic carefully, since it does give a negative result.

Key consideration: This is a foundational number skills topic, typically covered in Year 7-8 (ages 11-13). By the time students are 14-16, most should have mastered this. But the misconception persists more than we might expect.

The calibration anchor for the same misconception (Tom and Katie factorising) showed 0.473 classical difficulty, but that item layers algebraic factorisation on top. Stripping away the algebra and testing the rule directly should make this substantially easier.

On the other hand, I note that option A is an exceptionally well-designed distractor. The magnitude is exactly right (24), so a student only needs to make the sign error to be caught. This could push difficulty higher than a naive estimate.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.35, IRT b around 0.05. Discrimination should be good because the item cleanly separates students who know the sign rule from those who don't. Guessing should be low because the distractors are differentiated enough that random guessing is unlikely -- students will be drawn to specific wrong answers based on their misconceptions.
