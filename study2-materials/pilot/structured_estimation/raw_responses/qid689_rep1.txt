Analyzing 10 = 5/p. Students need to isolate p from a fraction where p is in the denominator. This is non-trivial for secondary students because many are accustomed to variables appearing in the numerator or as additive/multiplicative terms, not in the denominator of a fraction.

Step-by-step correct solution: multiply both sides by p to get 10p = 5, then divide both sides by 10 to get p = 0.5. Alternatively, recognize that 5/p = 10 means p = 5/10.

The misconception tested is using the same operation rather than the inverse. The key distractor for this is B) p = 50: the student sees "5 divided by p equals 10" and instead of dividing, multiplies 5 * 10 = 50. This is a very plausible error.

C) p = 2 is also quite attractive - students might compute 10/5 = 2, essentially flipping which number gets divided by which. D) "no solutions" could attract students who are unsure about variables in denominators.

Calibration comparison: The factorising item (Tom and Katie) had classical difficulty 0.473 and b = 0.404 with discrimination 1.451. That involved conceptual reasoning about signs. This item similarly requires conceptual understanding beyond routine procedure. However, the variable-in-denominator aspect might make this slightly harder for younger students.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.55, IRT b around 0.5. The strong, targeted distractors should give decent discrimination, maybe 1.3. Given that option D is essentially a throwaway for most students, effective choice is among 3 options, so guessing might be slightly above pure chance for 4 options.
