Item: 1/3 + 1/4 + 2/3 + 3/4. Answer: C (2). Misconception: adding numerators and denominators.

Starting from the student perspective. A Year 7 student sees four fractions to add. If they know fractions well, they might spot the pairs. If not, they need to find LCD=12 and convert all four fractions. That's a lot of steps for a student who's shaky on fractions.

The misconception distractor B (7/14) is the classic "add tops and bottoms" error. This misconception is extremely prevalent - research shows it persists even into adulthood for some people. The fact that 7/14 = 1/2 makes it seem like a reasonable answer too.

But wait - answer C is just "2", a whole number. Some students might be suspicious of a whole number answer for a fraction addition problem, thinking fractions should give fraction answers. This could actually push some students away from the correct answer. On the other hand, seeing "2" as an option might prompt students to check if the fractions pair up.

Distractor A (7/12) adds all numerators and uses 12 as a common denominator without proper conversion. Distractor D (28/12) might come from correctly getting LCD=12 and then making an error like 4+3+8+12=28 (miscounting 9 as 12 for 3/4 -> ?/12).

Comparing to calibration items, this feels moderate. The BODMAS item had difficulty 0.134 which seems too easy for this. The factorising item at 0.473 feels closer. I'd say this is around 0.30-0.35 classical difficulty. Fraction addition is fundamental and many students in this age range can handle it, but the four terms increase error probability.

Actually, I may be underestimating difficulty. The diagnostic nature of these assessments means they're often given to students currently learning the topic. Let me settle on around 0.33.
