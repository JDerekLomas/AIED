Analyzing this item: students must multiply (-4) by (-3) within the context of expanding (5p-4)(2p-2). The correct answer is +12.

Key considerations for difficulty estimation:

1. The context is bracket expansion (FOIL method), which is typically taught around Year 9-10 in the UK curriculum. The item doesn't require completing the full expansion - just one multiplication step. This reduces procedural demand.

2. The misconception "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative" is well-documented and persistent. Research consistently shows this is one of the most common errors in secondary mathematics. Many students, even those who can state the rule correctly, revert to the misconception under cognitive load.

3. The visual presentation adds a layer - students must interpret the diagram showing arrows pointing to specific terms. They need to recognize that "-4" and "-3" are the relevant terms including their signs.

4. Distractor analysis: Option B (-12) directly targets the misconception. Options A (+7) and D (-7) target students who might add rather than multiply. The presence of both +12 and -12 as options makes this a clean test of sign knowledge.

Looking at the calibration anchor with the same misconception (Tom/Katie, b=0.404, classical=0.473): that problem required evaluating two factorisations, identifying sign errors in products, and making a comparative judgment. This item is considerably more direct.

However, I should consider that the bracket expansion context might trip up students who haven't yet learned FOIL, making the item harder for younger students in the 11-16 range. Also, the visual/diagram dependency means some difficulty comes from interpretation rather than pure mathematical knowledge.

I'll estimate this as moderate difficulty: classical around 0.45, acknowledging the strong pull of the misconception especially in an algebraic context. IRT difficulty around 0.35, with solid discrimination.
