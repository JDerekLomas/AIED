Analyzing 2 x 3^2 with correct answer 18 (A).

This is a pure order-of-operations item focused on the precedence of exponentiation over multiplication. Two steps: evaluate the exponent (3^2 = 9), then multiply (2 x 9 = 18).

Distractor C (36) directly tests the misconception: a student computing left to right gets 2 x 3 = 6, then 6^2 = 36. This is highly plausible -- I'd expect it to be chosen by the majority of incorrect respondents.

Distractor B (12): 2 x 3 x 2. This suggests reading the superscript as a coefficient rather than an exponent. Less common but possible for younger students still learning exponent notation.

Distractor D (11): 2 + 3^2 = 11. A careless misread of the operation symbol, or confusion between x and +.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The BODMAS calibration item (0.4 - 1/5 x 3) had classical difficulty 0.134, IRT b = -0.245, and discrimination a = 1.552.
- That item tested multiplication before subtraction with fractions/decimals. The current item tests exponents before multiplication with whole numbers.

I think this item may actually be slightly harder than the calibration BODMAS item because:
1. Exponent precedence is less frequently practiced than multiplication-before-addition
2. The distractor 36 is a "clean" number that feels correct
3. Students sometimes remember "multiply and divide before add and subtract" but forget about exponents

But the simplicity of the numbers works in the other direction. On balance, I'd estimate classical difficulty around 0.25, making it somewhat harder than the calibration BODMAS item.

IRT difficulty around -0.15, discrimination around 1.5 (similar to the calibration item since both cleanly test one misconception), and low guessing since the distractors are specific enough to attract misconception-holders rather than random guessers.
