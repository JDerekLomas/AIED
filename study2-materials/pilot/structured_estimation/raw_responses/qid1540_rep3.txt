This item tests substitution into a quadratic expression with x = -1 in y = x² - 2x + 1.

The correct answer is B (4): (-1)² - 2(-1) + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

Key consideration: this expression is actually a perfect square, (x-1)². So y = (-1-1)² = (-2)² = 4. A student who recognizes this shortcut would avoid the negative arithmetic pitfalls entirely. This provides an alternative solution path that bypasses the misconception.

However, most students at this level will substitute term by term rather than factor first. And the term-by-term approach creates multiple opportunities for negative number errors.

The misconception "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative" is specifically triggered by (-1)². Students who think (-1)² = -1 will get either A or C depending on how they handle the -2(-1) term.

Distractor analysis:
- A (-2): Both (-1)² and -2(-1) computed incorrectly → -1 - 2 + 1 = -2
- B (4): Correct
- C (2): Only (-1)² wrong → -1 + 2 + 1 = 2
- D (0): Could arise from (x-1)² with x=1 substituted by mistake, or from computational errors

The availability of an alternative solution path (recognizing the perfect square) might slightly reduce difficulty for stronger students, increasing discrimination. This item should discriminate well.

Looking at the calibration item with the same misconception (factorisation, b=0.404, a=1.451), I think this item is comparable. The substitution task is more procedural but involves more arithmetic steps. I'll estimate similar difficulty.
