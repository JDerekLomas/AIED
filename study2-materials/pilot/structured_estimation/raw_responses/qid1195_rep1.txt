This item presents 2 x 3^2 and tests whether students respect the priority of exponentiation over multiplication. The correct computation is 3^2 = 9, then 2 x 9 = 18 (option A).

Distractor analysis:
- C (36): The classic left-to-right error: 2 x 3 = 6, then 6^2 = 36. This is the primary misconception target and likely the most selected wrong answer.
- B (12): Possibly from treating the superscript 2 as a multiplier: 2 x 3 x 2 = 12. This reflects a misunderstanding of exponent notation.
- D (11): Could arise from 2 + 3^2 = 2 + 9 = 11, confusing the multiplication sign with addition.

Comparing to the calibration item testing the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 x 3, classical difficulty 0.134): that item involved fractions, decimals, and subtraction, yet was easier. This seems counterintuitive. One explanation is that the fraction/decimal context might actually cue students to be more careful, while a simple-looking expression like 2 x 3^2 might cause overconfidence and hasty left-to-right processing.

On the other hand, exponent priority over multiplication is one of the most commonly taught BODMAS rules, and 3^2 is extremely familiar. I think this item is on the easier side but the misconception will trap a meaningful minority.

My estimate is around 25-30% incorrect. The left-to-right misconception with exponents is arguably more common than with multiplication/division ordering, because students sometimes learn "multiplication before addition" but forget "exponents before multiplication."

I'll place classical difficulty around 0.27, IRT difficulty around -0.2, with good discrimination since the item cleanly tests one specific misconception.
