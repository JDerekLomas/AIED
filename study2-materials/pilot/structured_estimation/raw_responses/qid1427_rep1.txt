Analyzing this item: students see two lines of working where x + 7 = ... becomes x = ..., and must identify the operation (the "star") applied to both sides.

The correct answer is D (-7), applying the inverse of +7. The key misconception distractor is A (+7), which tests whether students mistakenly use the same operation.

Comparing to calibration items with identical misconception:
1. Solve -5 = p + 10: difficulty 0.167, b = -0.702 -- requires both identifying AND executing the inverse operation
2. Function machine for x^2 + 5 = 14: difficulty 0.295, b = 0.002 -- involves two operations and square root
3. Inequality 2n + 3 <= 3n - 7: difficulty 0.569, b = 0.808 -- multi-step with variable on both sides

This target item only requires identifying the inverse operation, not executing it. That makes it simpler than even the easiest calibration item. Students don't need to compute any answer -- just recognize that undoing +7 means -7.

However, there's a wrinkle: the question is presented with an image showing lines of working and an arrow with a star. Students need to interpret this visual representation, which adds some cognitive overhead compared to a standard "solve this equation" prompt. Some younger students (age 11-12) encountering this format for the first time might be confused by the presentation rather than the mathematics.

The distractors B (x7) and C (/7) seem weakly plausible -- they involve 7 but the wrong type of operation entirely. Distractor A (+7) is the primary trap for students with the target misconception.

I estimate this is an easy item, likely easier than the p + 10 calibration example. Classical difficulty around 0.10-0.18, with a negative IRT difficulty. Good discrimination expected since the item cleanly targets one misconception.
