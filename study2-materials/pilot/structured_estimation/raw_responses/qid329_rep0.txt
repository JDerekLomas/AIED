This item asks students to evaluate two claims about order of operations with decimals. Let me analyze each claim:

Tom says: 0.1 - 0.2 / 0.3 = 0.1 - (0.2 / 0.3). This is correct because division has higher priority than subtraction, so the division should be performed first. Tom's parentheses correctly show the order.

Katie says: 0.1 - 0.2 / 0.3 = 0.2 / 0.3 - 0.1. Katie has rearranged the expression, putting the division first and then subtracting 0.1. However, subtraction is not commutative: a - b is not the same as b - a. So 0.1 - (0.2/0.3) = 0.1 - 0.667 = -0.567, while 0.2/0.3 - 0.1 = 0.667 - 0.1 = 0.567. These are different values. Katie is incorrect.

So only Tom is correct, answer A.

The misconception being tested is "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." A student with this misconception would compute (0.1 - 0.2) / 0.3 and might think Katie or both are correct.

Comparing to the calibration items: The order of operations item (0.4 - 1/5 x 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245 with discrimination 1.552. That item tested the same misconception but used fractions and multiplication. This item adds the complication of the Tom/Katie format and the subtlety that Katie's rearrangement looks plausible if you understand priority but miss the sign issue. The decimal context may also be slightly harder for some students.

However, the Tom/Katie format adds cognitive load since students must evaluate two claims. The distractors are moderately plausible -- Katie's statement looks reasonable on the surface because she did perform division before subtraction, but she changed the order of the subtraction operands. This could trap students who partially understand order of operations.

I'd estimate this is moderately difficult -- harder than the basic order of operations item but not as hard as the factorising or inequality items. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.35-0.40, placing it between the function machine item and the factorising item.
