Analyzing: ((0.5 / (0.2 + 0.4) - 0.3) x 0.6), which operation comes first?

The key mathematical principle is nested parentheses: innermost brackets are evaluated first. The expression (0.2 + 0.4) is the innermost grouping, so B is correct.

This is a recognition task rather than a computation task - the student doesn't actually need to calculate anything, just identify the correct first step. This makes it somewhat easier than if they had to carry through the full calculation.

However, parsing the nested bracket structure with all these decimals is non-trivial. The expression is visually dense. Let me think about how a typical Year 7-8 student would approach this. Many students at this level have been drilled on BIDMAS but still struggle with application, especially when brackets are nested.

The left-to-right misconception is extremely prevalent. Research consistently shows that even after explicit instruction, many students default to left-to-right processing. Option A (0.5 / 0.2) sits right at the start and would be the first thing a left-to-right reader encounters.

Option C is interesting because 0.4 appears in both the inner bracket and adjacent to 0.3. A student who misparses the brackets might think 0.4 - 0.3 is a natural grouping. Option D targets students who elevate multiplication above brackets.

Looking at the calibration items, the similar misconception item had classical difficulty 0.134 (quite easy). But this item has considerably more visual parsing required. I'd place it harder - perhaps around classical difficulty 0.35. The nested brackets create genuine confusion even for students who know the BIDMAS rules in principle.

For IRT parameters, I'd expect moderate difficulty (b around 0.1 to 0.3) and good discrimination since this is a clean test of bracket understanding. Guessing should be relatively low since the distractors target specific misconceptions rather than being arbitrary.
