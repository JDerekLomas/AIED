Let me analyze this item carefully. Students are shown a cups-and-counters diagram representing an equation being solved in three steps, and must identify which algebraic representation matches.

The visual shows:
Step 1: 1 cup + 4 counters = 2 cups + 2 counters => x + 4 = 2x + 2
Step 2: 4 counters = 1 cup + 2 counters => removing a cup from each side
Step 3: 2 counters = 1 cup => removing 2 counters from each side, so x = 2

Option A correctly shows x + 4 = 2x + 2 with x = 2. This is correct.

Option B shows 3x = 6, which would come from a student who adds all cups together (x + 2x = 3x) and all counters (4 + 2 = 6) - treating the equation as a collection rather than a balance.

Option C shows the correct initial equation but then 3x = 2, mixing the addition error with an incomplete collection of the constant terms.

Option D shows the correct initial equation but then 3x = 6, same collection error as B but at least recognizing the starting equation.

This is fundamentally about understanding that solving an equation requires inverse operations (subtraction to undo addition) rather than collecting everything together. The visual representation is meant to make this concrete, but the question asks students to go from concrete back to abstract (algebraic notation), which is a transfer task.

For difficulty estimation: The item requires multi-representational reasoning (visual to algebraic), which adds complexity. However, the cups-and-counters model is standard KS3 pedagogy. The key challenge is that distractors D is quite tempting - a student might recognize the initial equation correctly but then think "combine all the x terms and all the numbers."

Looking at calibration: The inequality item (2n + 3 <= 3n - 7) testing the same misconception had classical difficulty 0.569. That was more abstract. The function machine item testing the same misconception had 0.295. This item involves visual translation similar to the function machine item. I'd place this around 0.35-0.40 difficulty.

IRT difficulty probably around 0.15-0.30 given the representational translation demand. Discrimination should be decent since the misconception is clearly targeted.
