Analyzing this item: students must recognize that c / (h+4) written as a fraction is simply c over (h+4). This is a convention/notation question.

Let me think about what makes students get this wrong. The misconception is left-to-right processing ignoring priority. Distractor C, c/h + 4, is the trap for that misconception. But how many students actually fall for it?

I think this depends heavily on the age group. Younger students (11-12) who are just learning algebraic notation might find this confusing. Older students (14-16) should find this trivial. Given the broad 11-16 range, there will be meaningful variance.

Distractor analysis:
- A (correct): direct translation, visually clean
- B: c+4 over h+4 -- odd error, maybe students think the 4 distributes somehow
- C: c/h + 4 -- the target misconception, left-to-right reading
- D: (h+4)/c -- reversal of division

The distractors are somewhat plausible but answer A stands out as the simplest and most natural translation. Students who have any familiarity with fraction notation will likely choose A.

Comparing to calibration examples, the two items testing order-of-operations misconceptions had difficulty 0.134 (computational) and the equation items ranged higher. This is a pure recognition task. I think it's easy but not trivially so -- perhaps 0.25 classical difficulty, accounting for younger students in the sample who might not yet have learned algebraic fractions.

Actually, reconsidering -- the presence of variables (not just numbers) adds abstraction. Some students might overthink this. I'll keep my estimate around 0.25 and place IRT difficulty slightly below zero.
