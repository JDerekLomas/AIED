Target item: 3 - y = 5. Correct answer: y = -2 (B).

This is an equation-solving item embedded in a simultaneous equations context. The student is told Nick has nearly solved a pair of simultaneous equations and just needs to find y from 3 - y = 5.

The mathematical content is a linear equation in one variable, but with an unusual structure: the variable is subtracted rather than added. This means students need to deal with -y, which requires either:
1. Subtract 3: -y = 2, then y = -2
2. Recognize directly: y = 3 - 5 = -2

The misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" would lead a student to add rather than subtract (or vice versa). For instance, a student might try to "undo" the subtraction of y by subtracting again, or might add 3 to both sides getting -y = 8 then y = 8 or -8.

Actually, let me reconsider the distractors more carefully:
- y = 2: This is 5 - 3 = 2, ignoring the negative. Very plausible.
- y = -2: Correct.
- y = 8: Could come from 3 + 5 = 8, treating the subtraction as addition.
- y = -8: Perhaps -(3 + 5).

Looking at the calibration data, items testing this same misconception range from b = -0.702 to b = 0.808. The difficulty seems to scale with the complexity of the equation. This item is a simple one-step equation but with the tricky negative variable. I'd place it around classical difficulty 0.25-0.35.

The context of simultaneous equations might slightly increase difficulty because students might overthink it, but the question is quite clear about what to do. Discrimination should be solid -- this is a clean diagnostic item.
