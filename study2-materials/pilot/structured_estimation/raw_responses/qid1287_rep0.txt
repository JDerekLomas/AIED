This item asks students to translate a visual representation (cups and counters) into an algebraic equation and its solution steps. The diagram shows:
- Step 1: one cup + 4 counters = two cups + 2 counters, i.e., x + 4 = 2x + 2
- Step 2: 4 counters = one cup + 2 counters (subtracted one cup from both sides)
- Step 3: 2 counters = one cup (subtracted 2 counters from both sides)

So the correct algebraic representation is x + 4 = 2x + 2, solved step by step to get x = 2. This matches option A.

Looking at the distractors:
- B (3x = 6): This combines all cups and counters incorrectly, adding rather than keeping the equation balanced. A student might add x + 2x = 3x and 4 + 2 = 6.
- C (x + 4 = 2x + 2 then 3x = 2): Gets the equation right but then combines terms incorrectly, adding x + 2x = 3x on one side but only keeping the 2.
- D (x + 4 = 2x + 2 then 3x = 6): Gets the equation right but then adds all terms together rather than using inverse operations.

The misconception tested is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" - students who add x to both sides instead of subtracting get 2x + 4 = 3x + 2 or similar errors, leading to distractors like D where terms are combined rather than isolated.

Comparing to calibration items: The first calibration item (-5 = p + 10, classical difficulty 0.167) is a simpler equation. This item has additional complexity from the visual translation component, but the visual actually scaffolds the solution. The misconception is the same one tested in several calibration items.

The visual scaffolding makes the item somewhat easier since students can literally see the steps. However, the translation between representations adds cognitive load. I'd estimate this is moderate difficulty - harder than the simple equation (0.167) but easier than the factorising item (0.473). The distractors B and D are plausible for students who don't understand inverse operations.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.30-0.35, IRT difficulty around 0.0 to 0.2, moderate discrimination since it cleanly separates those who understand equation solving from those who don't.
