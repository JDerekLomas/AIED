The target item requires factorising x^2 - x - 6 into two binomials. Students must find factors of -6 that sum to -1. The factors are -3 and +2, giving (x-3)(x+2), which is option A.

Let me think about what makes this hard. The key challenge is managing negative signs. Students need to:
1. Recognise this is a quadratic to factorise
2. Identify that they need two numbers multiplying to -6 and adding to -1
3. Correctly determine those numbers are -3 and +2
4. Match to the correct option

The misconception about multiplying two negatives giving a negative is strong here. Option B, (x-3)(x-2), would be chosen by students who think (-3)(-2) = -6. This is a very common error.

Option D, (x+3)(x-2), gives x^2 + x - 6, which a student might pick if they get the signs of the linear term confused but correctly get the constant as -6. This is also a plausible error.

Looking at the calibration: the Tom/Katie factorising item had classical difficulty 0.473 and IRT b = 0.404. That item had an extra layer of complexity (evaluating two claims). This item is more straightforward factorisation, but all four options are quite similar, making it tricky.

I think difficulty is moderate -- perhaps slightly below the Tom/Katie item. Around 0.42 classical difficulty. Discrimination should be good since this cleanly tests algebraic understanding.
