This item asks students to identify a counter-example to the claim that 2n^2 - 1 is always positive. To solve it, students must substitute each value and evaluate:

A) 2(3/4)^2 - 1 = 2(9/16) - 1 = 9/8 - 1 = 1/8 > 0 (positive, not a counter-example)
B) 2(0.5)^2 - 1 = 2(0.25) - 1 = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5 < 0 (negative, IS a counter-example) -- CORRECT
C) 2(-2)^2 - 1 = 2(4) - 1 = 7 > 0 (positive)
D) 2(-1)^2 - 1 = 2(1) - 1 = 1 > 0 (positive)

The misconception being tested is "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer." Students holding this misconception would think (-2)^2 = -4 or (-1)^2 = -1, leading them to believe options C or D produce negative results, and thus pick one of those as the counter-example.

This is a moderately challenging item. The concept of counter-examples adds a layer of abstraction beyond simple substitution. Students need to understand what a counter-example is, correctly evaluate expressions with fractions/decimals and negative numbers squared, and then identify which yields a negative result.

Looking at the calibration items: the factorising item (misconception about negatives) had classical difficulty 0.473 and IRT b = 0.404. This item is somewhat harder because it combines the negatives misconception with understanding counter-examples and substitution into algebraic expressions. I'd estimate slightly higher difficulty.

The distractors are quite plausible -- C and D are specifically designed to trap students with the negatives misconception, and A involves a fraction that might confuse students who struggle with fraction arithmetic. The discrimination should be reasonable as it separates students who understand squaring negatives from those who don't.
