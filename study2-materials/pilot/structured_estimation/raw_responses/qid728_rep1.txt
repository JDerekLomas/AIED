The target item presents 16-6+4÷2 and asks which bracketing gives 7.

Evaluating options:
A) 16-(6+4)÷2 → 16 - (10÷2) → 16 - 5 = 11. Not 7.
B) (16-6)+4÷2 → 10 + 2 = 12. Not 7.
C) 16-6+(4÷2) → 10 + 2 = 12. Not 7.
D) (16-6+4)÷2 → 14÷2 = 7. Correct.

Key insight: without any brackets, using BODMAS correctly: 16 - 6 + (4÷2) = 16 - 6 + 2 = 12. But a student who goes left to right gets 16-6=10, +4=14, ÷2=7. So the misconception student would think "it already equals 7, why do I need brackets?" This is interesting because option D essentially enforces the left-to-right reading.

For difficulty estimation, I need to consider that students must evaluate multiple expressions. Some students may try to work backwards from 7 or test each option. The computational demands are moderate but not extreme -- basic arithmetic with small numbers.

The misconception about left-to-right operations is very common among younger secondary students. Looking at the calibration item testing the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 × 3), it had difficulty 0.134 (quite easy, only 13.4% got it wrong). But that was a direct computation. This item requires evaluating bracket placements, which adds complexity.

I think this item is moderately difficult. Students who understand BODMAS well can evaluate each option systematically. Those who don't may struggle to see why D works. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.30, placing it between the calibration BODMAS item and the function machine item.

The discrimination should be reasonable since understanding order of operations is a clear skill divide. Guessing is possible but the need to compute each option reduces pure guessing.
