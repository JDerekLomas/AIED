This item asks what a scientific calculator displays when you type -6^2. The key issue is order of operations: on a scientific calculator, exponentiation has higher priority than the unary minus. So the calculator evaluates 6^2 = 36 first, then applies the negative sign, giving -36. The correct answer is D.

The misconception tested is "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." A student who reads -6 as a single number and squares it would get 36 (option C). A student who thinks squaring means multiplying by 2 would get -12 (option B) or 12 (option A).

Looking at the calibration set, the order-of-operations item (0.4 - 1/5 x 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245. That item was relatively easy. However, this calculator item is trickier because many students (and even some teachers) believe -6^2 = 36. The negative sign before the exponentiation is a well-known source of confusion. The fact that it involves a calculator adds another layer -- students need to understand how the calculator interprets input.

The distractors are quite plausible. Option C (36) is the most attractive wrong answer, representing the common error of treating -6 as (-6) and squaring. Options A and B (12 and -12) capture students who confuse squaring with doubling.

I'd estimate this is moderately difficult. The misconception about -6^2 vs (-6)^2 is extremely common. I'd put classical difficulty around 0.45-0.55 -- roughly half of students will get it wrong. The IRT difficulty should be moderate positive, around 0.3-0.5. Discrimination should be decent since this cleanly separates students who understand order of operations from those who don't.

For guessing, option C is a very strong attractor, so random guessing is unlikely -- students who don't know will tend toward C. Guessing parameter should be low, maybe 0.05-0.10.
