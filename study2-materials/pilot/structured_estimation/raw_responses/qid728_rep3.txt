This item tests understanding of order of operations through bracket placement. Students must determine which placement of brackets in 16-6+4÷2 yields 7.

Computing each option:
D is correct: (16-6+4)÷2 = 14÷2 = 7.

The other options give 11 (A) and 12 (B and C).

The tested misconception is left-to-right processing. Without brackets, BODMAS gives 16-6+(4÷2) = 12. Left-to-right gives 7. So the correct answer D essentially groups the expression to force the left-to-right computation order.

How hard is this? Several factors:
1. Students must compute all four options (or be strategic about it). This is time-consuming.
2. The question is conceptually straightforward -- it's about brackets and BODMAS -- but requires careful arithmetic.
3. Some students might recognize that 7 = 14/2 and look for which option creates 14÷2.

I note that options B and C both yield 12. A student who evaluates both and gets 12 twice might gain confidence to focus on A and D. Option A yields 11, close to 12 but not 7. Only D gives 7.

The item requires more procedural work than conceptual depth. Students who systematically evaluate each option will find the answer. The main risk is arithmetic errors or not evaluating all options.

For calibration: the BODMAS calibration item was quite easy (0.134 incorrect). But that required a single computation. This requires four computations and understanding of bracket effects. I'd estimate this is notably harder, perhaps around 0.25-0.35.

Discrimination should be moderate -- BODMAS understanding clearly separates students, but the procedural nature means some students who understand might still make errors, and some who don't might guess correctly.
