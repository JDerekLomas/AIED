The item requires expanding the double brackets (m-5)(m-7). Using FOIL: m×m = m², m×(-7) = -7m, (-5)×m = -5m, (-5)×(-7) = +35. Combining: m² - 12m + 35, which is option B.

The key misconception is that multiplying two negatives gives a negative. This would lead a student to write (-5)(-7) = -35 and select option D (m² - 12m - 35). This is a very common error among Year 9-10 students who are still consolidating their understanding of directed number operations within algebraic contexts.

Comparing to calibration examples: The Tom and Katie factorising item tested the same misconception but was more cognitively demanding because students needed to verify two different factorisations and identify which person was correct. That item had difficulty 0.473. This item is more straightforward — just expand and simplify — but the presence of two negative terms in the brackets makes the sign error particularly likely.

The distractors are cleverly designed. Option A (m² - 2m - 35) would result from subtracting 7m - 5m = 2m (incorrect subtraction order or treating -7m + (-5m) as -7m - (-5m)) plus the negative product error. Option C (m² + 12m + 35) results from ignoring both negative signs entirely. Option D is the primary trap for the tested misconception.

Given the procedural nature and the strength of the sign misconception, I estimate around 0.42 classical difficulty. The item should discriminate reasonably well since it cleanly separates students who understand negative multiplication from those who don't.
