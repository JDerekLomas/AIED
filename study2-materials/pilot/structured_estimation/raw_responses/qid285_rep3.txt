Item: Make omega the subject of F = r * omega^2.

Solution path: Divide by r to get omega^2 = F/r, then square root to get omega = sqrt(F/r). This is answer B.

Let me think about this from a student perspective. A Year 10 student encountering this problem needs to:
1. Recognize that omega is being squared and multiplied by r
2. Know that to "undo" multiplication by r, you divide by r
3. Know that to "undo" squaring, you take the square root
4. Apply these operations in a valid sequence
5. Understand that sqrt(F/r) means the square root applies to the entire fraction

The use of omega (a Greek letter) and the physics-style formula F = r*omega^2 gives this a "real-world" feel that could be either helpful (motivation) or confusing (unfamiliarity). Many students first encounter omega in physics contexts, and the formula resembles centripetal force/acceleration formulas.

Distractor mapping:
- A: omega = rF^2 — random rearrangement, very weak
- C: omega = sqrt(rF) — uses multiplication instead of division (the tested misconception), strong distractor
- D: omega = sqrt(F)/r — partially correct reasoning but misapplies the square root operation, moderate distractor

I want to compare this with the calibration items carefully. The factorising item (b=0.404, classical=0.473) requires recognizing sign errors in expansion. The inequality (b=0.808, classical=0.569) requires multi-step algebraic manipulation with variables on both sides.

This formula rearrangement with a power is conceptually similar to the inequality in complexity but the abstractness is higher (no numbers at all). However, the procedural steps are fewer (just 2 operations). I think it falls between the factorising and inequality items.

My estimates: classical difficulty 0.48, IRT b = 0.45, discrimination 1.25 (the item is well-targeted for measuring algebraic manipulation skill), guessing around 0.10 (students who understand some algebra will engage with the problem rather than guess randomly).
