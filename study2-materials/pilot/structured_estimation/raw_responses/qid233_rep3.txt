Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks students to convert the expression 2 ÷ (3 + a × b) into proper algebraic convention (fraction notation).

The correct answer is C: 2/(ab+3)

To solve this correctly, students need to:
1. Understand that division becomes a fraction
2. Recognize that the entire expression (3 + a × b) is in the denominator due to parentheses
3. Apply order of operations within the parentheses: multiplication (a × b) before addition
4. Know that a × b is written as ab in algebraic convention
5. Recognize that ab + 3 is the same as 3 + ab (commutative property)

The misconception tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order."

Let me analyze each distractor:
- A) 2/3 + ab: This would result from ignoring the parentheses entirely and doing operations left to right (2÷3, then +a×b separately)
- B) 2/(b(a+3)): This would result from misreading or rearranging incorrectly
- C) 2/(ab+3): CORRECT - properly converts to fraction with correct order of operations
- D) 2/(a×b+3): This is almost correct but doesn't use proper algebraic convention (keeps the × sign)

Wait, let me reconsider D. The question asks for "correct algebraic convention" - so D is incorrect because it retains the multiplication sign, which is not standard algebraic convention. This is a subtle distinction.

Actually, looking more carefully:
- The main misconception (left to right operations) would lead to answer A
- Answer D tests whether students know that × should be omitted in algebraic notation

This is a relatively straightforward question about algebraic convention and order of operations. The calibration example with the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty of 0.134 and IRT difficulty of -0.245.

However, this question has additional complexity:
1. Converting division to fraction notation
2. Understanding that the parentheses determine what goes in the denominator
3. Knowing that × is omitted in algebraic convention
4. The commutative property (3 + ab vs ab + 3)

The distractors are moderately plausible. A would catch students who ignore parentheses and do left-to-right. D might catch students who understand order of operations but don't know the convention about omitting ×.

Given the multiple concepts involved and the subtle distinction between C and D, I'd estimate this is slightly harder than the calibration item with the same misconception.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The order of operations item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had difficulty 0.134
- This item is more complex due to algebraic convention requirements
- I'd estimate classical difficulty around 0.20-0.30

The discrimination should be moderate to good since it tests a clear understanding of algebraic convention and order of operations.
