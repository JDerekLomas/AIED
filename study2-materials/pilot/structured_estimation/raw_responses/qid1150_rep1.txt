Analyzing F = v^2/r, rearranging for v.

The solution path: multiply both sides by r to get v^2 = rF, then square root both sides to get v = sqrt(rF). Answer C.

Let me think about the distractor structure carefully. The misconception being tested is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse." In the original equation, v is squared and then divided by r. A student applying the same operation rather than the inverse would:
- Instead of multiplying by r (inverse of dividing), they might divide by r again
- Instead of taking the square root (inverse of squaring), they might square again

Option B (v = sqrt(F/r)) shows the first error -- dividing by r instead of multiplying. Option A (v = rF^2) shows the second error -- squaring F instead of square-rooting, combined with correct multiplication by r. These are strong distractors.

Looking at the calibration set, the items testing "same operation rather than inverse" range widely: b = -0.702 for simple linear, b = 0.002 for function machines, b = 0.808 for inequalities. This item involves rearranging a formula with powers and fractions, which is a higher-order skill than solving linear equations. I'd place it between the function machine and inequality items in difficulty.

The formula rearrangement topic is typically KS4 (GCSE), making it appropriate for the older end of the 11-16 range. The notation is standard but involves fractions and square roots which add visual complexity.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.48, with moderate discrimination since the distractors target specific misconceptions well.
