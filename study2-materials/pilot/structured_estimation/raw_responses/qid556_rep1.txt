The target item presents a partial equation-solving scenario: 9y = ... transforms to y = ..., and students must identify that dividing by 9 is what replaces the star. This is a foundational algebra concept typically introduced around Year 7-8 in the UK curriculum.

Comparing to calibration items with the same misconception:
- The simplest calibration item (-5 = p + 10) had difficulty 0.167 and involved a single additive inverse step with a negative number.
- The function machine item had difficulty 0.295 and required understanding of inverse operations in a more abstract context.
- The inequality item had difficulty 0.569 and involved multiple steps plus inequality handling.

This target item strips away nearly all complexity -- no negative numbers, no multi-step solving, no additional operations. The student just needs to know: "9 times y becomes y, so we divided by 9." This is arguably simpler than even the easiest calibration item because there's no computation to perform, just identification of the operation.

However, the diagram-based presentation is slightly unusual. Students must interpret the visual showing "9y =" becoming "y =" with a star representing the operation. This non-standard format could confuse some students, pushing difficulty slightly above what the pure conceptual simplicity would suggest.

The distractor x9 directly tests the misconception (using same operation instead of inverse). Options +9 and -9 test whether students default to additive rather than multiplicative thinking. These distractors have reasonable plausibility for weaker students.

I estimate this is quite easy -- around 0.15-0.18 classical difficulty. The IRT difficulty should be negative, perhaps around -0.7. Discrimination should be decent since it cleanly separates those who understand inverse operations from those who don't.
