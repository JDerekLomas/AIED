Analyzing this item: Students see two lines of Isaac's working. The top line is x - 7 = ..., the bottom line is x = ..., and there's an arrow with a star where the operation label goes. They need to identify that the star should be +7.

The mathematical content is minimal -- this is essentially asking "what is the inverse of subtracting 7?" No computation is required. The key prerequisite is understanding inverse operations in the context of equation solving, plus the ability to interpret the visual format showing working with labeled operations.

The misconception being tested (using same operation instead of inverse) is one of the most common early algebra misconceptions. However, this particular item format is quite scaffolded -- students can see that x - 7 becomes x, so the 7 needs to be removed. Even students with the misconception might reason from the visual that "something happened to get rid of the -7" and arrive at +7.

Calibration comparison: Three of the five calibration items test this same misconception. The easiest (classical difficulty 0.167, b = -0.702) requires solving -5 = p + 10. The medium one (0.295, b = 0.002) uses function machines. The hardest (0.569, b = 0.808) involves an inequality with multiple steps. This target item is simpler than all three since it isolates just the recognition of inverse operations without requiring computation.

However, I should consider that the visual/diagrammatic presentation might cause some confusion for students unfamiliar with this format of showing working. The question clarity is somewhat reduced by requiring interpretation of the image with the star notation.

My estimates: This should be one of the easiest items -- maybe 10-20% getting it wrong. The strong misconception-based distractor (-7) will catch some students, but the format is quite transparent. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.15, IRT b around -0.65, decent discrimination.
