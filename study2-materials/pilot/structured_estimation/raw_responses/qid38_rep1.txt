Analyzing 3/(2x) + 4/x. The correct procedure: recognize 2x is the LCD, rewrite 4/x as 8/(2x), add to get 11/(2x) = answer A.

Let me think about each distractor's pull:
- B (7/3x): This is the classic "add tops and bottoms" error. Very tempting for weak students.
- C (11/x): Student correctly gets 11 in numerator but simplifies denominator incorrectly or ignores the 2.
- D (7/2x): Student adds 3+4=7 without converting to common denominator, but recognizes 2x should stay.

This is an algebraic fractions question, typically encountered in Year 9-10 (ages 13-15). The concept builds on numeric fraction addition but adds the algebraic layer which increases abstraction.

The misconception "adds numerators and denominators" is one of the most persistent fraction errors, even among older students. With algebraic denominators making the LCD less obvious, I expect many students to fall for this.

Looking at calibration: the inequality problem (classical difficulty 0.569, IRT 0.808) involves multi-step algebraic manipulation. This algebraic fractions problem is similarly challenging but perhaps slightly less procedurally complex. I'll place it in a similar range but slightly lower on IRT difficulty since the steps are fewer.

I think discrimination will be moderate-to-good since this separates students who truly understand fraction addition from those who don't.
