This item asks students to solve (t-3)/2 = 1/8. The correct solution requires two inverse operations: multiply both sides by 2 to get t-3 = 1/4, then add 3 to get t = 3 1/4 (answer D).

The misconception being tested is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse." Looking at distractor C (t = 3 1/16), a student who divides 1/8 by 2 instead of multiplying would get 1/16, then adding 3 gives 3 1/16. This directly targets the misconception. Distractor A (6 1/4) might arise from multiplying both sides by 2 correctly to get 1/4 but then adding 3 to both the integer and fraction incorrectly, or from a different error path. Distractor B (t=1) could come from cross-multiplication errors or subtracting 3 instead of adding.

Comparing to calibration items: this involves fractions and a two-step equation, making it moderately difficult. The calibration item with -5 = p+10 (classical difficulty 0.167) is much simpler as it involves one step with integers. The inequality item (classical difficulty 0.569) is harder conceptually. This item sits somewhere in between - the fraction manipulation adds complexity but the equation structure is standard.

The distractors are reasonably plausible. Distractor C directly embodies the tested misconception and should attract students who habitually apply the same operation. The fraction context makes errors more likely than with integer equations.

I estimate this is moderately difficult - probably around 0.35-0.45 classical difficulty, with IRT difficulty near 0.2-0.5. The discrimination should be reasonable since the distractors target specific misconceptions.
