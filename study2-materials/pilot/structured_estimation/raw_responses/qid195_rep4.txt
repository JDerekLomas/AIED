Solving (t-3)/2 = 1/8:
- Multiply both sides by 2: t - 3 = 1/4
- Add 3: t = 3 1/4 (answer D)

This is a standard two-step equation but made more challenging by the fraction on the right-hand side and the fraction bar on the left acting as both grouping and division.

Misconception analysis: "uses same operation rather than inverse" - distractor C (3 1/16) captures this perfectly. A student who divides 1/8 by 2 gets 1/16 rather than multiplying to get 1/4. After correctly adding 3, they arrive at 3 1/16.

Distractor A (6 1/4): I believe this comes from reversing the order of operations - adding 3 to both sides first to get t/2 = 1/8 + 3 = 3 1/8, then multiplying by 2 to get 6 1/4. This is a common error when students don't respect the order of inverse operations.

Distractor B (1): This might come from cross-multiplying: 8(t-3) = 2*1, so 8t - 24 = 2, 8t = 26, t = 26/8 = 3.25. Wait, that actually gives the correct answer expressed differently. Let me reconsider. Perhaps B comes from a student who sets t-3 = 2*1/8 correctly but then computes t = 3 - 1/4 (subtracting instead of adding, another instance of using same operation). 3 - 1/4 = 2.75, not 1. Or perhaps a student who somehow gets t - 3 = -2, giving t = 1. The error path to B is less clear.

Compared to calibration: this should be harder than the basic equation items but perhaps comparable to the function machine item (0.295). The fractions push it higher. I'd say around 0.35 classical difficulty - not as hard as the factorising or inequality items because the structure is straightforward.

Discrimination should be solid since the distractors map to identifiable errors, and the item cleanly separates students who understand inverse operations from those who don't.
