Analyzing (t-3)/2 = 1/8 with correct answer D: t = 3 1/4.

To solve: first undo division by 2 (multiply both sides by 2), yielding t - 3 = 2/8 = 1/4. Then undo subtraction of 3 (add 3 to both sides), yielding t = 3 + 1/4 = 3 1/4.

The misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" maps to distractor C (3 1/16). If a student divides 1/8 by 2 (same operation as the denominator suggests division) instead of multiplying, they get 1/16, then correctly adding 3 gives 3 1/16.

Distractor A (6 1/4) is harder to reverse-engineer. One path: a student might multiply (t-3) by 2 on the left and multiply 1/8 by 2 on the right, getting t-3 = 1/4, but then add 3 to t and also multiply or add incorrectly to get 6 1/4. Perhaps they compute 1/4 times something, or interpret the equation differently.

Distractor B (t=1) might come from setting t-3 = -2 somehow, or from 8*(something) calculations gone wrong.

This item involves working with fractions in an equation context, which is known to be challenging for KS3/KS4 students. The combination of fraction arithmetic and algebraic manipulation increases difficulty compared to pure integer equations.

Looking at calibration: the simplest equation (-5 = p+10) had difficulty 0.167. The factorising item with more conceptual demands had 0.473. This item requires fraction fluency plus two algebraic steps, so I'd place it around 0.40 classical difficulty.

The item discriminates well because the misconception distractor is well-targeted, but the other distractors are somewhat less obvious in their error pathways, which might reduce discrimination slightly.
