Target: If d = -2, what is the value of 10 - 2d?
Options: A) -12, B) 6, C) 14 (correct), D) 32

This is a substitution problem involving negative numbers. Let me trace the correct solution and common errors.

Correct: 10 - 2(-2) = 10 - (-4) = 10 + 4 = 14.

The misconception is "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer." Let me think about how each distractor could be reached:

B = 6: Student computes 2 * (-2) = -4 correctly, but then does 10 + (-4) = 6. Wait — that's wrong. 10 - (-4) should be 14, not 6. Getting 6 means: 10 - 4 = 6, which means the student computed 2d = 2*2 = 4 (ignoring the negative of d) then subtracted. OR the student computes -2*(-2) = -4 (misconception: two negatives give negative), giving 10 + (-4) = 6. Either way, B captures the misconception well.

A = -12: This might come from computing -(10 + 2) = -12, or 10 - 22 where they interpret 2d as "twenty-two" when d=2. Actually: if a student interprets -2d as -2 * 2 = -4... no. Let me think differently. If they compute 2*(-2) = -4, then -(10) - 2 = -12... maybe reading expression as -(10-2d) and botching it. Or: -2 - 10 = -12? If they substitute and get -2d = -2(-2) and then confuse the whole expression. A seems like a weaker distractor.

D = 32: Hard to construct a natural error path. Maybe 10 * 2 + 12? Or confusing with something else. Weakest distractor.

Comparing to calibration anchors, this item has moderate conceptual load. The substitution concept is elementary but the negative arithmetic is a common stumbling block. The calibration item with the same misconception (Tom and Katie factorising) was significantly more complex and had difficulty 0.473. This item should be easier.

However, negative number multiplication errors are extremely common in KS3 populations. The simplicity of the item means students can't hide behind partial understanding — they either handle negatives or they don't. I'd expect around 25-30% getting it wrong.

I'll anchor my prediction closer to the easier calibration items but adjust upward for the misconception: classical difficulty ~0.28, IRT b ~-0.15, discrimination ~1.35 (clean item that separates well), guessing low since the distractors require specific errors.
