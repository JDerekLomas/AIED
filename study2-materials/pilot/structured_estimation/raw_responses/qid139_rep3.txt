This item is embedded in a bracket expansion task but isolates a single operation: (-4) x (-3). The student needs to identify that both terms are negative (from the expression (5p-4)(2p-3)) and apply the rule that negative times negative equals positive, yielding +12.

Let me think about this from a student perspective. A Year 9 student encountering this would need to:
1. Read and interpret the diagram showing which terms to multiply
2. Recognize that the terms are -4 and -3 (not just 4 and 3)
3. Know and apply the sign rule for multiplication
4. Compute 4 x 3 = 12

The critical step is recognizing and applying the sign rule. The misconception being tested is extremely common. In my experience with psychometric data, items testing negative x negative typically see error rates of 30-50% depending on the student population and item context.

The algebraic framing here is important. When the negatives appear as part of algebraic expressions in brackets, students may be more likely to err than in a bare arithmetic context like "what is (-4) x (-3)?". The algebraic context adds cognitive load and may cause students to focus on the procedure of expansion rather than the sign rules.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The easiest calibration item (solving -5=p+10) has classical difficulty 0.167 and b=-0.702. That's straightforward equation solving.
- The Tom/Katie item (same misconception) has classical difficulty 0.473 and b=0.404. But it's more complex.
- The inequality item has classical difficulty 0.569 and b=0.808. That's more demanding.

I think this item falls between the Tom/Katie item and the easier items. The directness of the question (just multiply two terms) should make it easier than Tom/Katie, but the misconception's strength keeps difficulty moderate. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.35, IRT b around 0.10.

For discrimination: the item should discriminate well because it cleanly separates students who understand the sign rule from those who don't. I expect a around 1.45. Guessing should be low since the misconception drives students to a specific wrong answer (B) rather than random selection.
