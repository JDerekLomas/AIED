Spinner 1: numbers 1-4 (P(1) = 1/4). Spinner 2: numbers 1-5 (P(1) = 1/5). P(1 on both) = 1/4 * 1/5 = 1/20. Correct answer B.

Let me consider this from a different angle - thinking about what proportion of the answer options a student might be drawn to based on different levels of understanding.

Strong students: Immediately recognize multiplication rule, compute 1/20, select B.

Middle students: These might recognize it involves combining probabilities but be unsure whether to add or multiply. Some might add the fractions correctly (1/4 + 1/5 = 9/20, not an option) and then get confused. Others might add incorrectly getting 2/9 (option C). Some might think about the total sample space but add instead of multiply: 4+5=9, giving 1/9 (option A).

Weak students: Might guess somewhat randomly but could be attracted to simpler-looking fractions like 1/9.

The item is fairly standard for UK secondary probability curriculum. Spinners are a common context. The question is clear and unambiguous. However, the reliance on a diagram (which we can't fully see) introduces some uncertainty about visual complexity.

Looking at calibration data patterns: items testing common misconceptions with plausible distractors tend to have moderate-to-high difficulty. The misconception about combining probabilities is extremely common in the research literature.

I'll estimate this as slightly easier than the inequality item but harder than the basic equation items. Maybe around 0.38 classical difficulty - I think the spinner context makes it slightly more accessible than pure abstract probability because students can visualize the outcomes. The sample space of 20 is manageable.

IRT discrimination: The item should discriminate reasonably well. Students who understand the multiplication rule will get it right; those who don't will be distributed across the distractors. I estimate around 1.35.
