Item: Expand -(2 - 3p), correct answer D: -2 + 3p.

This is fundamentally about two things: (1) understanding that the negative sign outside means multiply by -1, and (2) correctly applying sign rules when multiplying negatives.

Let me think about difficulty from a different angle - by considering what proportion of students at each ability level would get this right.

Low-ability students: Many would pick A (just removing brackets) or guess. Some might pick B.
Medium-ability students: This is where the misconception bites hardest. Students who partially understand expansion will correctly get -2 for the first term but stumble on -(-3p). Many will select B.
High-ability students: Should handle this correctly, selecting D.

The item has a subtlety: the expression is written as -(2 - 3p) rather than -1(2 - 3p). Some students may not even recognize this as an expansion problem, which could lead to answer A (thinking the negative and brackets are separate/ignorable).

Looking at the calibration anchor for the same misconception (factorising, 0.473 difficulty): that required students to check Katie's factorisation of x^2 - 5x - 6, which is a higher-level task. This expansion task is more procedural and direct. However, the misconception about double negatives is extremely common.

I think classical difficulty might be around 0.50 - this could be harder than I initially thought because: (1) the notation -(expression) without an explicit coefficient is less familiar, (2) the double negative is genuinely confusing, and (3) distractor B is very tempting.

Actually, on reflection, expanding a single negative bracket is quite standard. I'll estimate 0.40-0.48.

For discrimination: the item cleanly separates those who understand sign rules from those who don't, but the fact that lower-ability students might pick A rather than B could reduce discrimination slightly. I'll estimate around 1.2-1.3.

Guessing: with 4 options and plausible distractors, guessing should be relatively low, maybe 0.10-0.15.
