The expression is 10 - 8 x 7 + 6 and the question asks which calculation to perform first. Correct answer: C (8 x 7), testing BIDMAS/order of operations.

Let me approach this from a different angle. I want to think about the base rates in the calibration set and what patterns emerge.

The calibration items range from classical difficulty 0.167 to 0.569, with corresponding IRT difficulty from -0.702 to 0.808. There's a rough positive correlation as expected. The easiest items involve single-step equation solving; the hardest involves inequality manipulation with multiple steps.

The same-misconception calibration (0.4 - 1/5 x 3) has difficulty 0.134, making it the easiest in the calibration set. Order of operations appears to be well-understood by most students in this population.

Now, this target item is different in character: it's metacognitive rather than computational. Students must identify the rule rather than apply it. Research on mathematical metacognition suggests that explicit rule identification can sometimes be harder than implicit application. A student might correctly compute 0.4 - 0.2 x 3 by habit but struggle to articulate why multiplication comes first.

On the other hand, this question provides the answer options, making it recognition rather than recall. And option C is quite salient - multiplication "stands out" as different from the additions and subtractions.

Balancing these considerations, I think the difficulty is comparable to the calibration item - perhaps slightly higher due to the metacognitive demand. I'll estimate classical difficulty 0.20, IRT difficulty -0.40.

For discrimination: the item cleanly separates students on a single dimension (BIDMAS knowledge), so discrimination should be moderately high. The 4 options map to distinct student profiles: A (confused), B (left-to-right), C (correct), D (no awareness of precedence). This clean mapping should support good discrimination. I estimate a = 1.40.

Guessing: with well-differentiated options, random guessing should be minimal. Perhaps c = 0.04.
