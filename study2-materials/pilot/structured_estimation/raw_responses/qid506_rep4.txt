Target: 3p = 1/12, solve for p. Correct: p = 1/36 (B).

This is a one-step equation requiring division by 3. However, dividing a unit fraction by 3 is conceptually demanding for many students. The answer 1/36 has a large denominator which may seem wrong to students who lack confidence with fractions.

The primary misconception (same operation instead of inverse) leads directly to distractor A: 3 * (1/12) = 1/4. This answer is "nicer" than 1/36, which makes the error especially attractive. Students who are uncertain may gravitate toward the cleaner-looking fraction.

Let me consider the population. UK secondary students aged 11-16 span a wide range. Year 7-8 students would likely struggle significantly with this. By Year 10-11 most should handle it. The Eedi platform draws from across this range.

Anchoring against the calibration set:
- Simple inverse operation (integer): 0.167 difficulty
- Function machine (visual): 0.295
- Factorising (conceptual): 0.473
- Inequality (multi-step): 0.569

This item sits between the function machine and factorising items in terms of cognitive demand. The equation is structurally simple but fraction division adds a layer. I'd estimate around 0.35-0.40 classical difficulty.

For IRT parameters: difficulty around 0.10 to 0.20. Discrimination probably around 1.30-1.40 since the item has a clear correct path and well-targeted distractors. Guessing should be near zero given four distinct answer choices mapping to specific errors.
