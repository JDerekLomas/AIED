Analyzing the item: (-6) x star = -8. The student needs to find the value that replaces the star.

Step-by-step solution: Divide both sides by -6. star = -8 / (-6) = 8/6. The two negatives cancel, yielding a positive fraction. Answer D.

The misconception being tested is whether students understand that multiplying (or equivalently dividing) two negative numbers yields a positive result. Distractor C (-8/6) is the trap for students who get the fraction right but keep the negative sign, believing neg x neg = neg.

Distractor analysis:
- A (6/8): Positive but inverted — student may divide 6 by 8 instead of 8 by 6, perhaps confused about which number goes on top.
- B (-6/8): Both errors — inverted and negative.
- C (-8/6): The primary misconception distractor. Correct magnitude, wrong sign.
- D (8/6): Correct answer.

This item combines two potential stumbling blocks: forming the correct fraction and handling negative signs. The fraction formation could trip up weaker students regardless of the sign issue. However, the primary discrimination is on the sign rule.

Calibration comparison: The Tom/Katie factorising item (same misconception category) had difficulty 0.473 and b = 0.404. That item required factorising knowledge plus sign rules. This item requires simpler algebra (just division) but the fraction representation may be unfamiliar. I'd place this somewhat similarly — maybe slightly easier overall since the algebra is simpler.

I think classical difficulty is around 0.42, with IRT difficulty near 0.30. Discrimination should be reasonable since the distractors target specific errors. Some guessing is possible given 4 options.
