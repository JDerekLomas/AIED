The item presents 2/x + 3/x and asks for the simplest single fraction. Correct answer: 5/x (B).

Let me think about what makes this item tick from a psychometric standpoint.

The core skill: adding like fractions. The denominators are already the same. The only "algebra" here is that the denominator is x rather than a number. So this is really testing whether students can transfer their understanding of like-fraction addition to an algebraic context.

Distractor analysis:
- A: 5x/x^2. This student might have done something like finding a "common denominator" of x^2 and converting: 2x/x^2 + 3x/x^2 = 5x/x^2. Correct but not simplified. This is a process error (unnecessary work) rather than a conceptual error.
- C: 5/2x. Classic "add everything" approach. Numerators: 2+3=5. Denominators: x+x=2x. This is the targeted misconception.
- D: 6/x^2. Multiplication of fractions: 2*3=6, x*x=x^2. Student confused addition with multiplication.

I think this item may be somewhat harder than it looks at first glance. Algebraic fractions are a known pain point in the UK secondary curriculum. Even though the operation is simple, the algebraic context can throw students off. Additionally, distractor A is clever because it IS equivalent to the correct answer - students who know how to add fractions but don't simplify might pick it, and students who are unsure might be confused by seeing what appears to be two correct answers.

Actually, reconsidering - A being equivalent to B might actually reduce the item's effectiveness. Strong students might hesitate between A and B. Weaker students probably won't notice the equivalence.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.35. Algebraic fractions tend to be harder than people expect. IRT difficulty slightly positive, around 0.1. Discrimination moderate - the presence of a distractor equivalent to the correct answer might reduce discrimination slightly.
