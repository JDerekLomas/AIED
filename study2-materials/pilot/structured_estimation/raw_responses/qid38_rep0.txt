This item asks students to add two algebraic fractions: 3/(2x) + 4/x. To solve correctly, students need to find a common denominator (2x), convert 4/x to 8/(2x), then add numerators to get 11/(2x).

The misconception tested is "adds numerators and denominators" which would yield (3+4)/(2x+x) = 7/(3x), which is option B. This is a very common misconception with fraction addition.

Looking at the distractors:
- A (correct): 11/(2x) - requires proper common denominator work
- B: 7/(3x) - adds numerators AND denominators directly
- C: 11/x - might come from finding 11 correctly but losing the 2 in denominator
- D: 7/(2x) - adds numerators without converting (3+4=7) but keeps 2x as denominator

The item requires understanding of: algebraic fractions, common denominators, equivalent fractions with variables. This is typically KS3/KS4 content (ages 13-16).

Comparing to calibration items: The factorising item had classical difficulty 0.473 and IRT difficulty 0.404. Algebraic fractions are notoriously difficult for students. The misconception of adding numerators and denominators is extremely common. I'd estimate this is moderately difficult, perhaps slightly harder than the factorising item since algebraic fractions are a known pain point.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.50-0.55, IRT difficulty around 0.5-0.7.
