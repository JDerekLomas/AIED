Solving -3 < 2x + 1 < 7:
- Subtract 1: -4 < 2x < 6
- Divide by 2: -2 < x < 3 (Answer A)

I want to approach this estimation by carefully positioning this item relative to the calibration set.

Calibration item 1 (p=-5=p+10, classical=0.167, b=-0.702): Very easy single equation, one-step solve. Much easier than our target.

Calibration item 2 (order of operations, classical=0.134, b=-0.245): Easy for those who know BODMAS. Easier than our target.

Calibration item 3 (function machines for x^2+5=14, classical=0.295, b=0.002): Moderate, involves understanding inverse operations in a visual context. Our target is somewhat harder due to compound inequality format.

Calibration item 4 (factorising argument, classical=0.473, b=0.404): Requires checking two factorisations and understanding signs. Moderate-hard. Our target might be similar or slightly harder.

Calibration item 5 (solving inequality 2n+3 <= 3n-7, classical=0.569, b=0.808): Requires collecting like terms across an inequality. This is arguably harder procedurally because of the variable on both sides. Our target has simpler algebra but the compound format.

I think the compound inequality sits between calibration items 4 and 5. The algebra is straightforward but the three-part structure is unfamiliar to many students. Students who have practiced compound inequalities will find this routine; those who haven't will struggle with the format even if they can do single inequalities.

My estimate: classical difficulty approximately 0.55, somewhat higher than item 4 but close to item 5. The IRT difficulty I'd place around 0.60.

For discrimination: The item should discriminate well because there's a clear knowledge threshold (can you handle compound inequalities?). Students above this threshold will get it right; those below will choose distractors somewhat randomly. I'd estimate a = 1.35, which is in the range of the calibration items.

Guessing: The four options have different structures (different bounds), so pure guessing gives 0.25, but some partial knowledge might help eliminate D (which has very wide bounds). Low-ability students might be drawn to B or C. I estimate c around 0.18.
