Adding mixed numbers: 2 1/5 + 1 2/5. Answer must be a mixed number. Correct: A (3 3/5).

Step-by-step solution: Add whole numbers: 2+1=3. Add fractions: 1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5. Result: 3 3/5.

This is fundamentally a two-step problem with no need for finding common denominators, no carrying (since 3/5 < 1), and no simplification. It's about as simple as fraction addition gets.

The distractors probe different errors:
- B: correct computation, wrong form (improper fraction instead of mixed number)
- C: wrong computation (added denominators) AND wrong form
- D: correct whole number, wrong fraction computation (added denominators)

The "leave as mixed number" instruction is important. It should steer students away from B, but it might also confuse students who don't know what a mixed number is.

Thinking about difficulty: I note that the calibration items span from 0.134 (easy order of operations) to 0.569 (inequality solving). This fraction item should fall on the easier end. The like denominators make it accessible. But B being a correct-value distractor adds some difficulty from the instruction-following dimension.

I think the split might be roughly: 75% choose A, 12% choose B (correct value wrong form), 5% choose C, 8% choose D (the tested misconception). That gives classical difficulty of about 0.25.

For IRT: this maps to maybe b = -0.35. Not super easy but below average difficulty.
Discrimination: I expect moderate discrimination. The item is a bit too easy to strongly differentiate among average-to-high ability students. Maybe a = 1.10.
Guessing: minimal, around 0.03. The correct answer is recognizable.
