The item requires finding y when x=0 in the equation 3x + 2y = 6, using a table of values format.

With x=0: 3(0) + 2y = 6 → 2y = 6 → y = 3 (answer A).

Key considerations for difficulty estimation:

1. The table-of-values presentation is a standard format in UK KS3/KS4 maths. Most students should be familiar with it. However, weaker students might not connect the table to the equation properly.

2. x=0 is the easiest substitution case — it eliminates the 3x term entirely. This makes the actual computation trivial: just solve 2y=6.

3. The misconception "uses same operation rather than inverse" would manifest as multiplying by 2 instead of dividing, yielding 12 (option D). This is a common error pattern.

4. However, I note that option B (y=2) might actually be more tempting than D for some students. A student might think "the equation has a 2 in front of y, so y must be 2" or might confuse the structure. Option C (1.5) seems less likely but could catch students who somehow get 3/2.

Comparing to calibration set: This item is algebraically simpler than most calibration items. The -5=p+10 item (difficulty 0.167) required recognizing subtraction as inverse of addition. This item requires recognizing division as inverse of multiplication, which is comparable. But the table context adds a small interpretive layer.

I'll estimate difficulty slightly above the simplest calibration item. Perhaps 0.22. The table context could confuse some students who would otherwise solve 2y=6 easily, and the distractors are reasonably attractive.

Discrimination should be solid — around 1.2 to 1.4. This is a clean item that tests a specific skill.
