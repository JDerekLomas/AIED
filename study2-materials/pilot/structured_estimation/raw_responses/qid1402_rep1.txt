The expression is 3 + ab. Students must choose the correct English description. The correct answer A states "Add 3 to a multiplied by b," which correctly identifies that multiplication (ab) is performed before addition.

Key considerations:
- The misconception is applying operations left to right, ignoring that multiplication has higher priority than addition.
- Option C ("Add three to a and then multiply by b") represents exactly this misconception: reading 3 + a, then * b.
- Option D is a variant where the student might confuse the roles of a and b.
- Option B ("Add a and b then add three") is a weak distractor -- it misinterprets juxtaposition as addition, which is a different (less common) error.

This is fundamentally a reading comprehension task about algebraic notation. No computation is required. Students need to know: (1) ab means a times b, and (2) multiplication precedes addition in order of operations.

Comparing with calibration item 2 (same misconception, classical difficulty 0.134): that item required actual computation with decimals and fractions, making it procedurally harder but testing the same conceptual understanding. This item is purely interpretive. I think the difficulty is comparable -- perhaps slightly higher because translating between symbolic and verbal representations can trip students up, and the distractor C is quite tempting.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.18, IRT difficulty around -0.20. The discrimination should be solid because the item cleanly tests one concept. Guessing is minimal since this isn't a random-chance scenario -- students either understand the convention or they don't.
