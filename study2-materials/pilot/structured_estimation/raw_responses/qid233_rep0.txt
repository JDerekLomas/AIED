Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks students to convert a calculation written with division and multiplication symbols into proper algebraic convention (fraction notation).

Original expression: 2 ÷ (3 + a × b)

To solve this correctly:
1. Recognize that a × b should be written as ab in algebraic convention
2. Recognize that 2 ÷ (something) becomes 2/(something) as a fraction
3. The expression inside the brackets is 3 + a × b, which by order of operations means 3 + (a×b), so it becomes 3 + ab or ab + 3
4. The final answer should be 2/(ab + 3) which is option C

Let me analyze the distractors:
- A) 2/3 + ab: This represents someone who incorrectly applied left-to-right operations: 2÷3 = 2/3, then just added ab. This tests the misconception of ignoring brackets and order of operations.
- B) 2/(b(a+3)): This shows 2/(ab + 3b) expanded, which would come from misreading the expression as 2÷(3+a)×b or some other misinterpretation
- C) 2/(ab+3): CORRECT - properly converts to fraction notation with ab+3 in denominator
- D) 2/(a×b+3): This keeps the multiplication sign, which isn't following algebraic convention properly

The misconception being tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order" - this would lead to answer A, where someone does 2÷3 first, then adds ab.

Comparing to calibration examples:
- The order of operations question (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245
- That question also tested the same misconception

This question is slightly more complex because:
1. It involves algebraic notation conversion
2. It has brackets which should help students recognize grouping
3. Multiple concepts: division as fractions, multiplication convention (ab vs a×b), order of operations

The presence of brackets actually makes this clearer than the calibration example, so it might be slightly easier. However, the algebraic convention aspect adds complexity.

The distractors are fairly plausible, especially A for those who ignore brackets and D for those who don't know algebraic convention.

Rating analysis:
- Concept complexity: Involves order of operations, fraction notation, algebraic convention - moderate (5)
- Procedural steps: Recognize order of operations, convert to fraction, simplify notation - about 3 steps (4)
- Abstraction level: Working with algebraic expressions, moderate abstraction (6)
- Prerequisite knowledge: Need to know BIDMAS, fraction notation, algebraic conventions (5)
- Distractor plausibility: A is very plausible for the misconception, D tests convention knowledge (6)
- Misconception strength: Left-to-right processing is common but brackets help (5)
- Question clarity: Clear question, though "algebraic convention" might confuse some (7)
- Cognitive load: Need to hold multiple rules in mind (5)
- Age appropriateness: Perfect for KS3/KS4 algebra (9)
- Transfer distance: Somewhat standard but the convention aspect is less common (5)
- Visual complexity: Moderate - fraction notation and algebraic expressions (5)
- Solution uniqueness: Need to understand all aspects to get correct answer (7)

For predictions, comparing to the similar calibration item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3):
- That had classical difficulty 0.134, IRT difficulty -0.245, discrimination 1.552
- This item has brackets which should make it easier, but the algebraic convention adds complexity
- I'd estimate slightly harder than that item

Classical difficulty: ~0.20 (about 20% incorrect)
IRT difficulty: ~-0.15 (slightly easier than average)
IRT discrimination: ~1.4 (good discrimination)
Guessing: ~0.05 (low guessing, options are distinct)
