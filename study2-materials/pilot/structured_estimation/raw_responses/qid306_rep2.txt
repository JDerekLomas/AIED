This question assesses understanding of BIDMAS/order of operations at a meta-level -- students aren't asked to solve the problems but to identify which operation comes first. This is a common Year 7-8 topic.

Breaking down the correct reasoning:
- Problem P: 4 - 5 + 6. Both operations (subtraction and addition) are at the same level in BIDMAS. Convention is left-to-right, so 4 - 5 comes first.
- Problem Q: 4 + 5 x 6. Multiplication has higher priority than addition, so 5 x 6 comes first.
- Answer: B

Now considering what makes this item tricky. The interesting wrinkle is that for Problem P, going left-to-right IS the correct approach. So a student who always goes left-to-right would get P correct but Q incorrect -- landing on option A. This makes A a particularly strong distractor because it feels partially correct.

Option D is also somewhat plausible for students who understand multiplication priority but mistakenly believe there's an addition-before-subtraction rule (getting P wrong but Q right).

The misconception being tested (left-to-right regardless of priority) is extremely common, especially in younger secondary students. Research consistently shows this is one of the most persistent mathematical misconceptions.

However, the question format is quite transparent about what it's testing. Students who have been explicitly taught BIDMAS should find this straightforward. The difficulty comes from whether students have internalized the rule vs. just memorized the acronym.

Compared to calibration items: This is conceptually simpler than most calibration items since no computation is needed. The BIDMAS calibration item (difficulty 0.134) required actual calculation. I expect this to be somewhat harder than that because the dual-problem format creates more opportunities for error, and the meta-cognitive demand of "which operation first" (rather than "solve") is different from standard practice. I'll estimate around 0.20-0.28 classical difficulty.
