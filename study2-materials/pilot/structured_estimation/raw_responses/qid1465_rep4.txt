The expression is 3 - 5 + 4 × 2. By BIDMAS, multiplication takes priority: 4 × 2 = 8. Then proceeding left to right with addition/subtraction: 3 - 5 + 8 = 6. Correct answer: A.

I want to approach the difficulty estimation from the perspective of error rates on BIDMAS items in the literature. Research on order of operations consistently shows this is a persistent misconception, but typically more so for younger students. In a diagnostic assessment spanning ages 11-16, many students will have encountered and practiced BIDMAS extensively.

Key considerations for difficulty:
1. The expression mixes subtraction and multiplication—a common BIDMAS trap.
2. All numbers are small single-digit integers—low computational burden.
3. The left-to-right answer (4) is a clean, plausible number, making distractor B very tempting.
4. The negative intermediate (-2 from 3-5) when doing left-to-right might actually make some students pause and reconsider, potentially helping them realize they should check the order.

Distractor attractiveness: B is highly attractive (the main misconception). D could catch students who handle BIDMAS correctly but make a sign error (3 - 5 - 8 = -10 instead of 3 - 5 + 8 = 6). C (-12) seems to require multiple errors and will likely have low selection rates.

Comparing to calibration: The equation-solving items (e.g., -5 = p + 10, difficulty 0.167) test a different skill but have similar difficulty levels for what are considered "foundational" misconceptions. The BIDMAS calibration item (difficulty 0.134) is computationally harder but tests the same misconception.

I'll estimate this item is comparable in difficulty—perhaps marginally harder than the calibration BIDMAS item because the left-to-right answer here (4) is a cleaner, more attractive number than what the calibration item's left-to-right answer would be. Classical difficulty estimate: 0.20, IRT difficulty: -0.15.
