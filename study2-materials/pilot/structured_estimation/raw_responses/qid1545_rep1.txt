This item tests understanding of order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS) by asking students to compare two expressions that differ only in whether parentheses are present.

Computing each side:
- Left: 8 + 12 ÷ 4 = 8 + 3 = 11 (division before addition)
- Right: (8 + 12) ÷ 4 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5 (parentheses force addition first)

Therefore 11 > 5, so answer A is correct.

The key misconception: students who process left-to-right would compute the left as 8+12=20, then 20÷4=5, matching the right side, and select C (=). This is a very prevalent error, especially at KS3 level.

Comparing to the calibration item testing order of operations (0.4 - 1/5 × 3), that had difficulty 0.134. But that item used fractions and decimals together, which is actually a different kind of challenge. This current item uses only whole numbers but requires comparing two expressions, which is a slightly different cognitive task — more about conceptual understanding of why BODMAS matters rather than just computing a single answer.

The format with the box/square for the comparison symbol is fairly standard in UK maths assessments. The presence of ≥ as option D is interesting — it's technically true (11 ≥ 5) but students are expected to choose the most specific symbol. This could cause some confusion among stronger students who overthink it, though most would choose >.

I think the left-to-right misconception is so strong that a fair proportion of students will select C. I'd place this around 0.30-0.35 classical difficulty. The discrimination should be solid because it cleanly tests one concept.
