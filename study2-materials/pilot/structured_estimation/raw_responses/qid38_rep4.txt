Target: 3/(2x) + 4/x = ?

Working through the solution: The denominators are 2x and x. The LCM is 2x. So we rewrite 4/x as 8/(2x). Then 3/(2x) + 8/(2x) = (3+8)/(2x) = 11/(2x), which is option A.

Now, thinking about difficulty from a different angle - let me consider what proportion of the 11-16 age range would even have encountered algebraic fractions. Students in Year 7-8 (ages 11-13) likely haven't covered this topic. Year 9 students may have just been introduced to it. This means a significant chunk of the population would be guessing or applying numeric fraction strategies incorrectly to an algebraic context.

However, on a diagnostic assessment, students are typically given items matched to topics they've studied. So the relevant population is students who have been taught algebraic fractions. Among those students, the "add numerators and denominators" misconception would still be prevalent but less so than in the general 11-16 population.

The item is clean and unambiguous. The notation is standard. There's no extraneous information or visual complexity beyond the fraction notation itself.

For this analysis, I'll assume the test-taking population includes students across ability levels who have been exposed to this topic. Given the strong pull of misconception B and the reasonable attractiveness of D, I estimate about 40-45% will get it wrong.

The item should have decent discrimination - it cleanly tests whether students can add algebraic fractions correctly. Students who understand the concept will get it right; those who don't will predictably choose B or D.

Comparing to calibration: this feels similar in difficulty to the factorising item (0.473 classical, 0.404 IRT). Maybe slightly easier since the procedure is more mechanical, or slightly harder due to the fraction misconception strength. I'll say roughly comparable.
