Analyzing this item: students must form an equation from a word problem involving two operations (add 5, multiply by 4) applied sequentially. The correct answer uses brackets to show the addition happens before multiplication: 4(n+5)=17.

This tests the order-of-operations misconception where students write operations left-to-right without considering algebraic precedence rules.

Key considerations for difficulty estimation:

1. The "think of a number" problem type is extremely common in UK maths education, appearing from primary school onwards. Most students will have seen this format many times. This should reduce difficulty.

2. However, the specific trap here is subtle. Option A (n+5*4=17) looks natural because it reads like the problem statement. Students who haven't fully internalized why brackets exist in algebra will default to A.

3. Option B (4n+5=17) is a different kind of error -- it puts multiplication first, which doesn't match the narrative at all. Some students might select this if they're pattern-matching to common equation forms they've seen.

4. Option C (n^4+5=17) is weak -- only students who confuse "times 4" with "to the power 4" would choose this.

Looking at the calibration set more carefully:
- The pure BODMAS item: 0.134 classical difficulty (easy)
- The function machine item: 0.295 (moderate)
- The factorising item: 0.473 (harder)
- The inequality item: 0.569 (hardest)

This item sits somewhere between the BODMAS and function machine items conceptually. The task is forming an equation, which requires bracket understanding. I think many students will get this right because the "think of a number" format is well-drilled, but the distractor A will catch a significant minority.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.35. The inequality and factorising items are harder because they require more advanced algebra. This item is more foundational.

For discrimination: bracket understanding is a clear dividing line in student ability, so discrimination should be good -- around 1.2-1.3. Guessing should be low since students approach this with a definite strategy.
