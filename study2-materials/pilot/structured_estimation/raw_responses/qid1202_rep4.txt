Solving 3 - y = 5 for y. The correct value is y = -2 (option B).

Working through the solution paths:
- Method 1: 3 - y = 5 => -y = 5 - 3 => -y = 2 => y = -2
- Method 2: 3 - y = 5 => 3 - 5 = y => -2 = y (rearranging, recognizing y = 3 - 5)
- Method 3: Substitute and check. 3 - (-2) = 3 + 2 = 5. Correct.

This item is interesting because it tests multiple potential failure points: handling subtraction of the variable, dealing with the implicit -1 coefficient, and managing negative results. However, it's fundamentally a one-step algebraic manipulation.

The simultaneous equations framing is a narrative wrapper that shouldn't substantially change difficulty, though it signals to students that this is an algebra context requiring formal solving rather than arithmetic intuition.

Comparing carefully to the calibration set:
- The easiest calibration item (p + 10 = -5, difficulty 0.167) has a simpler structure with positive variable coefficient.
- The order-of-operations item (difficulty 0.134) tests a different skill entirely.
- The function machine (difficulty 0.295) requires understanding of inverse operations visually.

I think this item sits close to the function machine in difficulty. The negative coefficient is the main challenge. Students in KS3/KS4 often get confused by equations like a - x = b. I'll estimate around 0.30 classical difficulty.

For IRT parameters: discrimination should be moderate-to-good since this is a focused diagnostic item. The guessing parameter could be slightly elevated because students who are truly lost might pick randomly, but option A is such a strong distractor that confused students will likely gravitate there rather than guess randomly -- which actually means the effective guessing rate is low (students don't guess uniformly).
