This item tests whether students can translate c / (h+4) into correct fraction notation. It targets the misconception of applying operations left-to-right without respecting grouping.

Key considerations:

1. The correct answer A is the most parsimonious option -- it's literally what the expression says. This makes it potentially easy for students to identify even without deep understanding, just by pattern matching.

2. The misconception distractor (C: c/h + 4) requires the student to actively misparse the brackets. Students who understand that brackets mean "treat as a single unit" will not be tempted.

3. Distractor D (fraction flipped) tests a different misconception entirely -- confusion about dividend vs. divisor. This could catch some students.

4. Distractor B is the weakest distractor -- it's hard to see a natural reasoning path that leads to adding 4 to the numerator.

For difficulty estimation, I need to consider:
- The calibration item with the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 x 3 = ?) had classical difficulty 0.134, meaning 86.6% got it right. That item required computation.
- This item requires only notation recognition, which could go either way: easier because no computation, or harder because algebraic notation is abstract.

I think overall this is an easy item. The correct answer visually "looks right" and matches the structure of the expression. I estimate around 0.20 classical difficulty.

For discrimination: this should discriminate reasonably well, separating students who understand algebraic fraction notation from those who don't. I estimate a around 1.30.

Guessing: with four options and one clearly matching option, true guessing should be minimal. Maybe 0.05.
