This item tests whether students can extract the gradient from a linear equation in general form. The equation 5x + 3y = 15 needs to be rearranged to y = mx + c form.

Rearranging: 3y = -5x + 15, so y = (-5/3)x + 5. The gradient m = -5/3, answer D.

The misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" is central here. When students move 5x to the right side, they should subtract it (giving -5x), but students with this misconception might add or simply transpose without changing sign, yielding +5x on the right, leading to gradient +5/3 (distractor C).

Let me think about the difficulty calibration more carefully. The calibration items with this same misconception show:
- Simple linear equation (p=-15): classical diff = 0.167, very easy
- Function machines (visual): classical diff = 0.295, moderate
- Inequality with multiple steps: classical diff = 0.569, harder

This gradient item combines equation rearrangement with the concept of gradient, which is a higher-level topic typically taught at GCSE level (ages 14-16). Not all 11-16 year olds will have encountered this. However, for those who have, it's a fairly standard question. The presence of fractions in the answer adds cognitive load.

I think this is moderately difficult. The four distractors are excellently constructed -- each one corresponds to a specific error. This should produce good discrimination. The fraction -5/3 as the correct answer may deter some students who expect integer gradients, potentially pushing them toward A or B.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.48-0.55, IRT difficulty around 0.3-0.5.
