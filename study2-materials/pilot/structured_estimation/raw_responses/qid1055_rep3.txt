This item tests whether students can correctly add fractions with unlike denominators: 3/5 + 1/4.

Solution path: Find common denominator 20, convert to 12/20 + 5/20 = 17/20.

The misconception pathway (add numerators and denominators) leads directly to option A: (3+1)/(5+4) = 4/9.

I want to think carefully about how hard this actually is. Adding fractions is a core KS2/KS3 skill in the UK national curriculum. By Year 7, students should have been taught this. But the research literature consistently shows that fraction addition misconceptions are among the most persistent in mathematics education.

However, I should consider that in a diagnostic assessment context, students may be more careful. Also, the population is ages 11-16, meaning older students who've had years of practice should get this right.

Let me reconsider the distractors from a student perspective:
- A) 4/9: The most natural incorrect answer from the misconception. Very tempting.
- B) 4/20: Requires knowing to find common denominator but failing to convert numerators. Less common error.
- C) 7/20: Unclear error pathway - maybe adding 3 (numerator) + 4 (denominator of second fraction) = 7? Unusual.
- D) 17/20: Correct.

The fact that options B-D all share denominator 20 means a student who finds the common denominator correctly is then choosing among three options. This could help discrimination since getting the denominator right is the key conceptual hurdle.

I'm going to estimate this as slightly easier than the function machine item. The concept is straightforward even if the misconception is strong. Maybe 0.30-0.35 proportion incorrect. The discrimination should be good because this is a clean diagnostic item.

One thing that makes this potentially easier: 17/20 is the only option greater than 1/2, and students might estimate that 3/5 (which is more than half) plus 1/4 should be more than 1/2, eliminating some wrong answers through number sense.
