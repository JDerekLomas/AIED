This item asks students to identify the product of (-1) and (-4) in the context of expanding brackets (2p-1)(3p-4). The correct answer is +4, since multiplying two negative numbers yields a positive result.

Looking at the calibration items, the factorising question (Tom and Katie) tested the same misconception -- "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer" -- and had classical difficulty 0.473 and IRT b = 0.404. That item required more complex reasoning (evaluating two factorizations and determining sign outcomes), whereas this item isolates the multiplication step more directly. However, this item embeds the multiplication within a bracket expansion context, and the arrows in the diagram add a layer of interpretation.

The distractors are well-designed: -4 (the most common error from the target misconception), +5 and -5 (from adding instead of multiplying). So there are two plausible misconceptions at play: (1) negative times negative gives negative, and (2) adding instead of multiplying. This should make the item moderately difficult.

Comparing to the calibration: the Tom/Katie item at 0.473 difficulty involved more steps but the same core misconception. This item is more focused but still requires understanding of signed number multiplication in an algebraic context. I'd estimate slightly lower difficulty -- perhaps around 0.40. The misconception about negatives is quite common among younger students but those who have practiced bracket expansion should handle it.

For discrimination, the item cleanly separates students who understand signed multiplication from those who don't. I'd expect moderate-to-good discrimination, around 1.2-1.4. The guessing parameter should be low since students with the misconception will systematically choose B (-4), not guess randomly.
