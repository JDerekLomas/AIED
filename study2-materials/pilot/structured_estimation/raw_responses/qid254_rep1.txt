Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks students to identify the correct calculation for finding the mean of 0, 1, 3, 4, 7.

The correct answer is A: (1+3+4+7)/5

Wait, let me check this. The mean of 0, 1, 3, 4, 7 should be:
(0+1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3

Looking at option A: (1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3
This gives the correct answer because adding 0 doesn't change the sum, so (0+1+3+4+7)/5 = (1+3+4+7)/5

Option B: 0+1+3+4+7÷5 - This would be interpreted as 0+1+3+4+(7÷5) = 0+1+3+4+1.4 = 9.4 if following BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly. But students who do left to right would get (0+1+3+4+7)÷5 = 15÷5 = 3.

Option C: (1+3+4+7)/4 = 15/4 = 3.75 - This divides by 4 instead of 5, perhaps thinking 0 shouldn't count.

Option D: None of them

The misconception being tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." This relates to option B - students who don't understand order of operations might think B is correct because they would read it left to right and get the right answer (3), not realizing that mathematically B means something different.

So the correct answer A works because:
1. It uses proper fraction notation showing all operations in numerator before dividing
2. Including or excluding 0 in the sum doesn't change the result
3. It divides by 5 (the correct count)

Concept complexity: This involves understanding of mean (average), order of operations, and the role of zero. Moderate complexity - about 4.

Procedural steps: Students need to understand what mean calculation requires, evaluate each option mentally, and consider order of operations. About 3-4 steps.

Abstraction level: This is fairly concrete - working with specific numbers and comparing expressions. About 4.

Prerequisite knowledge: Need to know mean formula, order of operations (BIDMAS), and understand mathematical notation. About 5.

Distractor plausibility: B is very plausible for students who don't understand order of operations. C might attract students who think 0 shouldn't count. D might attract confused students. High plausibility - about 7.

Misconception strength: Order of operations misconception is very common among secondary students. About 7.

Question clarity: The question is clear about what's being asked. About 8.

Cognitive load: Moderate - need to hold multiple options in mind and evaluate each. About 5.

Age appropriateness: Mean calculation and order of operations are core KS3 topics (ages 11-14). Very appropriate - about 9.

Transfer distance: This is a somewhat unusual presentation - asking which calculation is correct rather than computing the mean directly. About 5.

Visual complexity: Simple notation, no diagrams. About 3.

Solution uniqueness: Students need to understand both mean calculation AND order of operations to get this right. About 7.

For predictions:
Looking at the calibration example with the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 × 3), that had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245.

This question seems slightly more complex because students need to:
1. Recognize that option A is correct despite missing the 0 in the written sum
2. Recognize that option B would be wrong due to order of operations
3. Recognize that option C divides by wrong number

I'd estimate this is moderately easy but with some trap potential. Classical difficulty around 0.25-0.35, IRT difficulty around 0.0 to 0.3.

Discrimination should be moderate to good since it tests a specific misconception clearly - around 1.3.

Guessing probability is low since the question requires understanding - around 0.1.
