This question asks students to identify the correct algebraic fraction representation of c divided by (h+4). Let me work through each option:

A) c/(h+4) -- This is exactly c divided by the quantity (h+4). Correct.
B) (c+4)/(h+4) -- The +4 has been added to the numerator as well. Incorrect.
C) c/h + 4 -- The division only applies to c/h and the 4 is added separately. This is the left-to-right misconception distractor.
D) (h+4)/c -- The fraction is inverted. Incorrect.

Now, how difficult is this for UK secondary students?

I want to think about this from a different angle than pure content analysis. Let me consider what the student population looks like. In the Eedi dataset, these are students actively using a diagnostic platform, so they may skew slightly more engaged than average. The age range 11-16 is very broad.

For algebraic notation specifically, this is typically introduced around Year 7-8 (ages 11-13) in the UK curriculum. By Year 9+, most students should find this straightforward. So difficulty depends heavily on the age distribution in the sample.

One thing I notice: the misconception label says "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order," but the item is really more about understanding bracket notation in the context of division/fractions. The left-to-right misconception is more directly tested when students must decide operation order in computation. Here, it's about translating notation. This slight mismatch might mean the item doesn't discriminate as sharply on this specific misconception.

Looking at calibration data, items testing similar misconceptions tend to be on the easier side (0.134 to 0.295). I'd place this around 0.28 -- slightly harder than the pure computation BIDMAS item because the algebraic abstraction with variables can trip up younger students, and distractor C is reasonably tempting if you don't think carefully about the brackets.

For IRT parameters: moderate discrimination since the item cleanly tests a concept but may have some noise from the notation-vs-computation distinction. Low guessing.
