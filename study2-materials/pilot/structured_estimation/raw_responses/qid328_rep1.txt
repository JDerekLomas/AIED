The item is 2/9 + 1/3. To solve correctly, a student needs to recognize that 9 and 3 share a common multiple (9), convert 1/3 to 3/9, and then add: 2/9 + 3/9 = 5/9.

Let me consider how UK students at KS3 would approach this. Adding fractions with unlike denominators is typically taught around Year 7-8. By the time students are 13-14, most should be able to handle this, but younger students (11-12) may still struggle.

The misconception tested — adding numerators and denominators — is one of the most persistent fraction errors in mathematics education research. It's well-documented and very common. Distractor B (3/12) directly captures this. Distractor C (3/9) might come from a student who correctly keeps the denominator as 9 but just adds 2+1=3 without converting 1/3. Distractor D (1/6) is harder to explain — possibly a student who thinks you multiply denominators to get 27 and then... no, that doesn't work. It might just be a general "looks like a fraction answer" distractor.

Given the calibration set, the easiest item (proportion incorrect 0.134) involved order of operations with decimals and fractions. This fraction addition item is simpler conceptually but the misconception is very strong. I'd estimate around 0.25-0.30 proportion incorrect.

One key factor: the denominators are related (3 is a factor of 9), making this easier than adding fractions with unrelated denominators. Students who recognize this relationship can solve it more easily. This should keep difficulty moderate.

Discrimination should be decent — this cleanly separates students who understand fraction addition from those who don't. But it won't be extremely high because some students may get it right through partial understanding or familiarity rather than deep conceptual grasp.
