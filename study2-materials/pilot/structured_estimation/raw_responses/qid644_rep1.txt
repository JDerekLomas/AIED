The target item presents a bracket expansion task: (2p-1)(3p-4), with arrows pointing to -1 and -4. Students must compute (-1)x(-4). The correct answer is +4 (option A). The key misconception is believing that multiplying two negatives gives a negative result, which would lead to choosing B (-4). Options C (+5) and D (-5) correspond to adding the terms instead of multiplying.

Considering the student population (UK ages 11-16), bracket expansion is typically introduced around Year 8-9 (ages 12-14). The misconception about negative multiplication is persistent and widespread. Many students who can mechanically expand brackets still stumble on sign rules, especially when both terms are negative.

The visual component (arrows in a diagram) actually helps clarify what the question is asking -- it isolates the specific multiplication. However, some students might still be confused by the presentation if they haven't seen this arrow notation before.

Looking at the calibration anchor: the Tom/Katie factorising item (same misconception) was at 0.473 classical difficulty, b=0.404. That item was harder because students had to evaluate two claims and reason about signs in reverse (factoring vs expanding). This item is more straightforward -- just multiply two indicated terms. So I'd place it somewhat easier, maybe around 0.35-0.42 classical difficulty.

However, the distractor +5/-5 pair might catch some students who confuse operations, adding a secondary source of errors beyond the primary misconception. This could push difficulty up slightly.

Discrimination should be decent since the item targets a specific, binary understanding (either you know the sign rule or you don't). I estimate a ~1.3. Guessing should be modest -- students with the misconception will be drawn to B confidently, not guessing.
