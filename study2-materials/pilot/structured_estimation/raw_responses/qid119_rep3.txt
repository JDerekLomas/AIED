Let me approach this from the student experience perspective first, then verify the mathematics.

A Year 8 or 9 student sees this problem. There's a diagram with arrows — a big leftward arrow labeled -24 and a smaller one that's a third the size. They need to evaluate Tom's multiplication and Katie's division.

Mathematical verification:
- Tom: -3 × (-8). Product of two negatives is positive. -3 × (-8) = 24, not -24. Wrong.
- Katie: (-24) ÷ (-3). Quotient of two negatives is positive. (-24)/(-3) = 8, not -8. Wrong.
- Correct answer: D.

What makes this item interesting psychometrically is the interplay between the diagram and the algebraic statements. The diagram naturally represents -24 as a leftward arrow and the smaller arrow (also leftward) as -8. So visually, it "looks like" -24 divided into 3 parts gives -8. This visual representation actually reinforces the misconception because directed arrows preserve the negative sign in a way that feels intuitive. Students see left arrows and think "negative stays negative."

This is a particularly strong test of the misconception because:
1. The visual supports the incorrect reasoning
2. Both statements have the right magnitudes
3. Students must rely purely on abstract sign rules against visual intuition

Difficulty estimation: I think this is harder than the factorising calibration item (0.473). The factorising item at least had the possibility that students could expand brackets to check. Here, the visual actively works against correct reasoning. I'd estimate 0.55-0.60 classical difficulty.

However, I should consider that multiplication/division of negatives is taught earlier and more directly than factorising, so some students may have had more practice with sign rules. This could offset some of the difficulty. Perhaps 0.50-0.55.

Discrimination: The item should discriminate well since it cleanly separates students who understand sign rules from those who don't. The "who is correct" format is clean. I estimate a=1.30-1.45.

Guessing: The strong pull of option C (both correct, for students with the misconception) means guessing is relatively low — students with the misconception are confident in C, not randomly guessing. Maybe c=0.10-0.15.
