You are an expert psychometrician analyzing math assessment items for UK secondary school students (ages 11-16). These are 4-choice multiple-choice questions from diagnostic math assessments.

## Calibration Examples
Below are 5 items with their known psychometric parameters. Use these to calibrate your judgments.

Question: Solve the equation:
\(
-5=p+10
\)
A) \( p=5 \)
B) \( p=-5 \)
C) \( p=-15 \)
D) \( p=15 \)
Correct answer: C
Misconception tested: When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse

Actual parameters:
  Classical difficulty (proportion incorrect): 0.167
  IRT difficulty (b, 2PL): -0.702
  IRT discrimination (a, 2PL): 1.324
  Guessing parameter (c, 3PL): 0.000

Question: \( 0.4-\frac{1}{5} \times 3= \)
A) \( 0.2 \)
B) \( 0.6 \)
C) \( -0.2 \)
D) \( 0.06 \)
Correct answer: C
Misconception tested: Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order

Actual parameters:
  Classical difficulty (proportion incorrect): 0.134
  IRT difficulty (b, 2PL): -0.245
  IRT discrimination (a, 2PL): 1.552
  Guessing parameter (c, 3PL): 0.000

Question: Which function machine will solve the equation \( x^{2}+5=14 ? \)
A) ![A function machine showing x as the input then +5 then squaring to give 14 as the output. Then a reverse function machine underneath showing 14 (the output) now as the input square root and then -5]()
B) ![A function machine showing 14 as the input then squaring and +5 to give the output]()
C) ![A function machine showing x as the input then squaring then +5 to give 14 as the output. Then a reverse function machine underneath showing 14 (the output) now as the input -5 and then square root]()
D) ![A function machine showing x as the input then x2 then +5 to give 14 as the output. Then a reverse function machine underneath showing 14 (the output) now as the input  -5 and then divide by 2]()
Correct answer: C
Misconception tested: When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse

Actual parameters:
  Classical difficulty (proportion incorrect): 0.295
  IRT difficulty (b, 2PL): 0.002
  IRT discrimination (a, 2PL): 1.227
  Guessing parameter (c, 3PL): 0.000

Question: Tom and Katie are arguing about factorising. Tom says \( x^{2}+5 x+6 \equiv(x+3)(x+2) \) 
Katie says \( x^{2}-5 x-6 \equiv(x-3)(x-2) \) 
Who is correct?
A) Only Tom
B) Only Katie
C) Both Tom and Katie
D) Neither is correct
Correct answer: A
Misconception tested: Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer

Actual parameters:
  Classical difficulty (proportion incorrect): 0.473
  IRT difficulty (b, 2PL): 0.404
  IRT discrimination (a, 2PL): 1.451
  Guessing parameter (c, 3PL): 0.186

Question: Solve
\[
2 n+3 \leq 3 n-7
\]
A) \( 2 \leq n \)
B) \( 10 \leq n \)
C) \( n \leq 10 \)
D) \( -4 \leq n \)
Correct answer: B
Misconception tested: When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse

Actual parameters:
  Classical difficulty (proportion incorrect): 0.569
  IRT difficulty (b, 2PL): 0.808
  IRT discrimination (a, 2PL): 1.050
  Guessing parameter (c, 3PL): 0.193

## Target Item
Analyze this item and provide your ratings and predictions.

Question: What does the following equal?
\[
8-7+10 \times 3
\]
A) \( 36 \)
B) \( 31 \)
C) \( -29 \)
D) \( 33 \)
Correct answer: B
Misconception tested: Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order

## Instructions
1. First, think through the item carefully in <chain_of_thought> tags.
2. Then provide 12 ratings (integer 1-10) in <ratings> tags, each in its own XML tag.
3. Finally, provide 4 direct predictions in <predictions> tags.

Rating dimensions (1-10 scale):
- concept_complexity: Number/depth of math concepts involved
- procedural_steps: Number of sequential steps to solve
- abstraction_level: Concrete (1) to abstract (10)
- prerequisite_knowledge: Amount of prior math knowledge needed
- distractor_plausibility: How attractive the wrong answers are
- misconception_strength: How common the tested misconception is
- question_clarity: How unambiguous the question is (10 = very clear)
- cognitive_load: Working memory demands
- age_appropriateness: Match to 11-16 curriculum (10 = perfect match)
- transfer_distance: Distance from standard textbook presentation
- visual_complexity: Notation/diagram complexity
- solution_uniqueness: Whether partial knowledge helps (10 = must fully understand)

Prediction ranges:
- classical_difficulty: proportion of students answering INCORRECTLY, 0 to 1 (higher = harder)
- irt_difficulty: b parameter, typically -1 to 1 (most items), extreme range -5 to 2
- irt_discrimination: a parameter, roughly 0.3 to 3
- guessing_probability: c parameter, 0 to 0.5
