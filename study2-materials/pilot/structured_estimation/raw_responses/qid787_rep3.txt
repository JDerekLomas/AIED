Target item: Evaluate whether Jo and Paul correctly rearranged 2v - 5 = 6v - 3.

Let me trace through each claim systematically.

Jo claims: 2v - 8 = 6v
What operation would produce this from 2v - 5 = 6v - 3?
Left side: 2v - 5 → 2v - 8 means she applied -3 (subtracted 3)
Right side: 6v - 3 → 6v means she applied +3 (added 3)
She applied DIFFERENT operations to each side! On the left she subtracted 3, on the right she added 3. An equation requires the same operation on both sides. Jo is incorrect.

Wait, let me reconsider. Perhaps Jo intended to "move -3 to the left." If she's thinking of it that way, the correct procedure is to add 3 to both sides. Left: 2v - 5 + 3 = 2v - 2. Right: 6v - 3 + 3 = 6v. So the correct result would be 2v - 2 = 6v. Jo got 2v - 8, suggesting she subtracted 3 from the left rather than adding it — the "same operation instead of inverse" misconception.

Paul claims: 2v = 6v - 8
He appears to be moving -5 from the left to the right. Correct procedure: add 5 to both sides. Left: 2v - 5 + 5 = 2v. Right: 6v - 3 + 5 = 6v + 2. So the correct result would be 2v = 6v + 2. Paul got 6v - 8, meaning he subtracted 5 from the right: 6v - 3 - 5 = 6v - 8. Same misconception.

Correct answer: D (Neither).

This item is interesting because it tests metacognitive skills — can students recognize an error they themselves might make? The "neither is correct" answer is psychologically difficult because it requires rejecting all offered solutions and being confident in that rejection. Many students will second-guess themselves and default to C (both correct), especially if they share the misconception.

Comparing with calibration items, I note the same misconception appears in three calibration items spanning a wide range of difficulties (b from -0.702 to 0.808). The simpler equation-solving item (p + 10 = -5) was easy (b = -0.702) because it's a straightforward one-step solve. The inequality item was hard (b = 0.808) because of the additional complexity. This item falls somewhere between — the algebra is basic but the evaluation task is demanding.

The dual-evaluation structure combined with the "neither" correct answer pushes this toward higher difficulty. I estimate classical difficulty around 0.62 and IRT b around 0.75. The discrimination might be slightly lower than some calibration items because the "who is correct" format introduces additional variance from reasoning about others' work rather than directly demonstrating one's own understanding.
