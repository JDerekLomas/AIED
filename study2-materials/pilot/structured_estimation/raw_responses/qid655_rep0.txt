This item asks students to find the missing value in (-6) x star = -8. To solve, students must divide both sides by -6, giving star = -8 / -6 = 8/6. The key conceptual demands are: (1) understanding how to isolate a variable in a multiplication equation, (2) dividing two negative numbers to get a positive result, and (3) expressing the answer as a fraction.

Looking at the distractors:
- A: 6/8 — wrong magnitude (inverted fraction), but positive. Student may have set up the fraction incorrectly (dividing 6 by 8 instead of 8 by 6).
- B: -6/8 — inverted fraction AND wrong sign. Student thinks negative times negative is negative AND inverts.
- C: -8/6 — correct magnitude but wrong sign. This is the key misconception distractor: the student correctly forms 8/6 but believes the answer should be negative.
- D: 8/6 — correct. Two negatives multiply to give positive, and 8/6 is the right fraction.

The misconception "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer" maps directly to distractor C. This is a very common misconception among KS3/KS4 students. The distractors are well-designed — each represents a distinct error pattern.

Comparing to calibration items: The factorising item (Tom and Katie) tested the same misconception and had classical difficulty 0.473 and IRT difficulty 0.404. This item is somewhat simpler in overall content (no factorising, just basic equation solving with negatives and fractions), but the fraction aspect adds complexity. The negative number rules misconception is strong, especially when combined with fractions.

I estimate this is a moderate difficulty item — perhaps slightly easier than the factorising item since the mathematical content is more straightforward, but the negative signs with fractions create confusion. I'd estimate around 0.40-0.50 classical difficulty and moderate IRT difficulty around 0.2-0.5.
