Analyzing target item qid550 on order of operations.

First, verifying the mathematics:
- Tom: 3+2-1 = 4; 3-1+2 = 4. Equal. Tom is correct.
- Katie: 3+2x1 = 3+2 = 5; 2x1+3 = 2+3 = 5. Equal. Katie is correct.
Both are correct, so C.

Now for psychometric analysis. Let me think about this from a test-design perspective.

The misconception "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order" is interesting here because of how the numbers interact. Since 2x1=2, the multiplication by 1 is an identity operation. A student doing left-to-right on Katie's LHS gets: 3+2=5, 5x1=5 - same answer! And on RHS: 2x1=2, 2+3=5 - also the same whether you use BIDMAS or not. So computationally, the misconception is invisible for these particular numbers.

This means the item primarily tests whether students have a conceptual belief that mixing operations prevents rearrangement, rather than whether they can actually apply BIDMAS correctly. It's more of a "mathematical reasoning about structure" item than a "can you compute" item.

For difficulty estimation, I want to anchor carefully to the calibration set:
- The two easiest items (difficulty ~0.15) were straightforward computation
- The medium item (0.295) required interpreting function machines
- The harder items (0.47, 0.57) required more complex reasoning or multiple concepts

This item involves simple computation but conceptual judgment. The Tom/Katie format is used in one calibration item (0.473) but that involved quadratic factoring. Here the math is elementary. I think difficulty sits between the easy computation items and the medium function machine item.

My estimate: classical difficulty around 0.25. Many students will simply compute both sides and verify. Some will be tripped up by the format or by overthinking Katie's claim.

For discrimination: this should discriminate reasonably well between students who understand mathematical equivalence and those who have rigid procedural thinking. I'll estimate around 1.2-1.3.

Guessing: with 4 options, baseline is 0.25, but "Both" might attract some guessing since students might think it's a trick question where both are right. I'll set guessing relatively low at 0.05-0.10.
