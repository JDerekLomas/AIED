Item: 12d - 3 = 6d + 3. Solve for d. Correct: d = 1.

Step-by-step solution: Subtract 6d from both sides to get 6d - 3 = 3. Add 3 to both sides: 6d = 6. Divide: d = 1.

This requires 3 procedural steps and understanding of inverse operations and balancing equations. The variable appears on both sides, which is a recognized difficulty jump for students compared to one-sided variable equations.

Examining the distractors through the lens of common errors:
- d = 0 (A): A student might think subtracting gives 12d - 6d = 0 somehow, or just default to zero.
- d = -1 (C): Sign confusion - perhaps subtracting 3 from 3 and getting -6 instead of 6, yielding d = -1.
- d = 1/3 (D): The targeted misconception - adding 6d to 12d (using same operation) gives 18d - 3 = 3, so 18d = 6, d = 1/3.

Looking at calibration anchors, the first equation item (p+10=-5) was quite easy at 0.167 incorrect. But that was one-step. The factorising item had 0.473 difficulty. I think this equation with variables on both sides is intermediate - the concept isn't hard but the multi-step procedure and larger coefficients create room for error.

I'll estimate slightly higher difficulty than my initial instinct because variables-on-both-sides is a known stumbling block in the UK curriculum, and the large coefficients (12, 6) may intimidate weaker students. Classical difficulty perhaps 0.35-0.45.

For discrimination, the item should discriminate well because the correct procedure is clear-cut - students either can or cannot handle variables on both sides. The guessing parameter should be low since the answer choices are spread out numerically.
