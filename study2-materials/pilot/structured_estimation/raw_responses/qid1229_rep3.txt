Item: What does a scientific calculator give for -6^2? Options: 12, -12, 36, -36. Correct: D (-36).

The item tests whether students understand that exponentiation has higher precedence than unary negation. On a scientific calculator, typing -6^2 computes -(6^2) = -36.

Thinking about the student population (UK, ages 11-16): This convention is typically encountered in Key Stage 3-4. Students learn about BIDMAS, but the interaction between negation and exponentiation is a specific subtlety that many curricula don't emphasize enough.

Distractor appeal:
- C (36) is by far the strongest distractor. Most students who err will choose this, thinking (-6)^2 = 36.
- A (12) and B (-12) capture doubling errors, which are less common but plausible for weaker students who confuse x^2 with 2x.

Calibration comparison: The two order-of-operations related calibration items show a range. The straightforward one (0.4 - 1/5 x 3) was easy (0.134 incorrect). But that involved a standard BIDMAS application. The -6^2 item involves a much more commonly held misconception. I think this is harder than the inequality item (0.569) because the -6^2 misconception catches even competent students.

My estimates:
- Classical difficulty: 0.48. I'll be slightly less pessimistic than my initial instinct because some students will have been explicitly warned about this.
- IRT difficulty: 0.35. Moderate.
- Discrimination: 1.40. Should discriminate well -- it cleanly separates deep from surface understanding.
- Guessing: 0.10. Small chance of guessing right since C is such a strong attractor, but some students might reason by elimination or recall being told about this specific case.
