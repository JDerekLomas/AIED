This item asks students to solve 10 = 5/p for p. The correct solution requires understanding that 5/p = 10 means p = 5/10 = 0.5. This involves algebraic manipulation with a variable in the denominator, which is conceptually more challenging than standard linear equations.

Looking at the distractors:
- A) p = 0.5 (correct: 5/0.5 = 10)
- B) p = 50 (likely from multiplying 5 * 10 = 50, treating division as multiplication)
- C) p = 2 (likely from 10/5 = 2, inverting the fraction incorrectly)
- D) No solutions (a distractor for students who get confused by the variable in the denominator)

The tested misconception is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse." Distractor B (p=50) directly captures this: a student who sees division and multiplies 5*10 gets 50. Distractor C (p=2) comes from dividing 10 by 5, which is a different error - perhaps treating 5/p as p/5.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The simple equation -5 = p+10 had classical difficulty 0.167 and IRT b = -0.702. That's straightforward linear.
- The inequality 2n+3 <= 3n-7 had classical difficulty 0.569 and b = 0.808, involving multiple steps.
- This item has a variable in the denominator, which is a notable conceptual step up from standard linear equations, but the numbers are simple (5 and 10). I'd estimate it's moderately difficult, perhaps around classical difficulty 0.45-0.55, with IRT difficulty around 0.3-0.6.

The discrimination should be moderate - the distractors target specific misconceptions but the variable-in-denominator format may confuse students in ways not fully captured by a single misconception. I'd estimate a around 1.1-1.3. Some guessing is possible given 4 choices, maybe c around 0.10.
