Let me analyze this item step by step.

The equation is 8x/5 = 40. Students need to evaluate two proposed next steps.

Tom says: 8x = 8. If we check, to isolate 8x we should multiply both sides by 5, giving 8x = 200. Tom appears to have divided 40 by 5 instead of multiplying — this is the classic "same operation instead of inverse" misconception. So Tom is incorrect.

Katie says: x/5 = 5. She divided both sides by 8: (8x/5)/8 = 40/8, giving x/5 = 5. This is algebraically valid. So Katie is correct.

The correct answer is B (Only Katie).

Now, considering the distractor analysis:
- Option A (Only Tom): Would be chosen by students who don't check the work carefully or who share Tom's misconception
- Option C (Both): Students might think both steps look reasonable without checking
- Option D (Neither): Students confused about valid algebraic moves

This is a "who is correct" format which adds cognitive load — students must evaluate two claims rather than solve directly. The misconception tested (same operation vs inverse) is very common at KS3/KS4 level.

Comparing to calibration items: The equation-solving misconception items range from 0.167 (simple linear) to 0.569 (inequality). This item has the added complexity of the fractional coefficient and the "evaluate two students" format, which increases difficulty. The fraction 8x/5 makes it harder to spot the error. I'd estimate this is moderately difficult, perhaps around 0.40-0.50 classical difficulty.

For discrimination, items testing this misconception tend to discriminate well (1.0-1.5 range). The "who is correct" format might reduce discrimination slightly since it requires meta-reasoning.

Guessing: With four options and some partial knowledge possible, guessing around 0.10-0.15.
