The target item: 3/(2x) + 4/x, correct answer A = 11/(2x).

Step-by-step solution: LCD = 2x. Convert 4/x = 8/(2x). Then 3/(2x) + 8/(2x) = 11/(2x).

Key considerations:
1. Students must recognize that x and 2x share a common factor, so LCD is 2x not 2x^2.
2. Students must multiply only the numerator of 4/x by 2 to get 8/(2x).
3. Then add numerators: 3 + 8 = 11.

The misconception (adding numerators and denominators) leads to B: (3+4)/(2x+x) = 7/(3x). This is an extremely well-documented misconception in mathematics education research.

However, I want to consider whether option D might also be quite attractive. A student who adds 3+4=7 but correctly identifies 2x as the denominator would pick D. This represents a partial understanding - they know the denominator should be 2x but don't convert the second fraction properly.

Compared to calibration items, this requires algebraic fraction manipulation which is typically Year 10+ content. The factorising item (0.473 classical difficulty) tests Year 10 algebra. I think this item is comparable or slightly harder because fraction misconceptions are so deeply ingrained.

I'll estimate this as moderately difficult. The strong misconception pull of option B and reasonable attractiveness of D suggest many students will err. But the question is very clear and well-structured, so high-ability students should have no trouble.

My estimate: classical difficulty around 0.55, moderate-high IRT difficulty.
