This item asks students to add 2/9 + 1/3. The correct procedure requires finding a common denominator (9), converting 1/3 to 3/9, then adding numerators: 2/9 + 3/9 = 5/9.

Looking at the distractors:
- A) 5/9 — correct answer
- B) 3/12 — this is what you get if you add numerators (2+1=3) and add denominators (9+3=12), which is exactly the tested misconception
- C) 3/9 — could result from just adding numerators without converting (2+1=3) over 9, or misunderstanding the process
- D) 1/6 — possibly from subtracting or some other error; 2/9 - 1/9 wouldn't give this either. Maybe a student who simplifies 3/12 incorrectly to 1/6? Actually 3/12 = 1/4, not 1/6. Or perhaps from some other confusion.

The misconception of adding numerators and denominators is extremely common among younger students learning fractions. This is a fundamental fraction operation taught early in secondary school.

Comparing to calibration items: The equation -5 = p+10 had classical difficulty 0.167 (easy). This fraction addition is also relatively straightforward but the misconception is very tempting. I'd expect moderate difficulty — maybe around 0.25-0.35 proportion incorrect. The item is clear, standard textbook fare.

The distractor B directly targets the misconception and is quite plausible. Distractor C is also attractive. This should give reasonable discrimination since students who understand common denominators will get it right, while those who don't will be drawn to B or C.

For IRT parameters: moderate difficulty, decent discrimination. The guessing rate should be low since distractors are well-designed and students with the misconception will systematically choose wrong answers rather than guess randomly.
