The target item requires adding 2 7/10 + 2 1/4 and expressing the result as a mixed number.

Step-by-step solution: The whole parts sum to 4. For the fractional parts, 7/10 + 1/4 requires LCD = 20. Converting: 14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20. Answer: 4 19/20.

Distractor analysis:
- A) 99/20: This is the correct value but as an improper fraction. Students who don't follow the "mixed number" instruction or who convert everything to improper fractions first and forget to convert back would pick this.
- C) 99/40: This might come from multiplying the denominators (10*4=40) rather than finding LCD, then somehow getting 99 in the numerator. Less plausible.
- D) 4 8/14: Classic misconception - adding numerators (7+1=8) and denominators (10+4=14). This is the primary distractor.

The misconception of adding numerators and denominators is one of the most persistent errors in fraction arithmetic, particularly strong in KS3 (ages 11-14). Many students who haven't fully internalized the meaning of fractions make this error.

Comparing to the calibration set: The equation -5=p+10 had classical difficulty 0.167 (easy). The factorising item had 0.473 (moderate). This fraction addition item should fall somewhere in the moderate range. Fraction operations are notoriously challenging for UK secondary students, but this is a fairly standard question. I'd place it around 0.35-0.40.

The discrimination should be reasonable since the distractors map to specific misconceptions, helping separate students who understand fraction addition from those who don't.
