Let me analyze this item carefully.

**The Question:**
Find the 15th term of the sequence defined by u_n = 1 - 3n

**Correct Solution:**
u_15 = 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -44

So the correct answer is A) -44

**Analyzing the Distractors:**

- A) -44: Correct answer (1 - 45 = -44)
- B) -46: This could come from 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -44, but getting -46 might be from an arithmetic error
- C) -14: This could come from doing (1-3) × 15 = -2 × 15 = -30... no wait. Let me think. If someone does 1 - 3 = -2, then -2 × 15 = -30. That doesn't give -14.
  Actually, -14 might come from 1 - 15 = -14 (ignoring the coefficient 3)
- D) -30: This comes from doing operations left to right: (1-3) × 15 = -2 × 15 = -30

**The Misconception Tested:**
"Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"

This matches distractor D) -30, where the student computes (1-3) × n = -2 × 15 = -30 instead of 1 - (3×n) = 1 - 45 = -44.

**Comparison to Calibration Items:**

The calibration item testing the same misconception was:
0.4 - 1/5 × 3 with classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245

This current item is similar but involves:
1. Understanding sequence notation u_n
2. Substituting n = 15
3. Following order of operations with subtraction and multiplication

The sequence notation adds some abstraction compared to the pure arithmetic problem. However, the calculation itself is straightforward.

**Rating Analysis:**

- Concept complexity: Involves sequence notation and order of operations - moderate (4)
- Procedural steps: Substitute n=15, multiply 3×15, subtract from 1 - about 3 steps (3)
- Abstraction level: Uses algebraic notation for sequences - moderate (5)
- Prerequisite knowledge: Need to know sequence notation, substitution, BIDMAS (5)
- Distractor plausibility: D is very plausible for the misconception; others less so (6)
- Misconception strength: Order of operations errors are common (7)
- Question clarity: Very clear what's being asked (9)
- Cognitive load: Moderate - need to remember substitution and order of operations (4)
- Age appropriateness: Sequences are typically KS3/KS4 content - very appropriate (9)
- Transfer distance: Fairly standard sequence problem (3)
- Visual complexity: Simple algebraic notation (3)
- Solution uniqueness: Need to understand both substitution and order of operations (7)

**Difficulty Prediction:**

Compared to the calibration item (0.134 classical difficulty), this item adds the complexity of sequence notation which might trip up some students. However, the arithmetic is straightforward. The misconception distractor (-30) is quite tempting for students who don't follow BIDMAS.

I'd estimate this is slightly harder than the calibration item due to the additional abstraction of sequence notation, but still relatively easy overall. Classical difficulty around 0.20-0.25.

The discrimination should be moderate to good since it clearly separates those who understand order of operations from those who don't.
