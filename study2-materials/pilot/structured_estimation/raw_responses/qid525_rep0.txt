This item asks students to add two mixed numbers: 2 7/10 + 2 1/4. The correct answer is 4 19/20 (option B).

To solve: Add whole numbers (2+2=4), then add fractions (7/10 + 1/4). Finding common denominator of 20: 14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20. Result: 4 19/20.

The misconception tested is "when adding fractions, adds numerators and denominators." A student with this misconception would compute 7/10 + 1/4 as (7+1)/(10+4) = 8/14, giving 4 8/14 (option D). This is a very common misconception.

Option A (99/20) is the correct answer as an improper fraction, not a mixed number. This catches students who convert correctly but don't read the instruction to leave as mixed number.
Option C (99/40) would result from incorrectly multiplying denominators instead of finding LCD, then converting.
Option D (4 8/14) directly tests the target misconception.

Comparing to calibration items: This requires knowledge of fraction addition with unlike denominators plus mixed number handling. It's procedurally involved but conceptually straightforward. The misconception of adding numerators and denominators is extremely common among younger secondary students.

Looking at calibration difficulty levels, this seems moderate - harder than simple equation solving but not as hard as factorising or inequalities. I'd estimate around 0.35-0.45 classical difficulty. The distractors are well-designed, especially D which directly targets the misconception and A which is a partial-credit trap.
