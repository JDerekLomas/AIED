**Explanation:**
According to the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. Tom’s statement correctly represents this by grouping the division in brackets, showing it is evaluated first. Katie’s statement is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not equivalent to $b - a$. Therefore, only Tom is correct.
