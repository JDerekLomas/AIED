ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are right because of how BIDMAS works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so those are the same. For Katie, you have to do the multiplication first either way. $3 + (2 \times 1) = 5$ and $(2 \times 1) + 3 = 5$, so that works as well. They are basically just swapping the order of the terms but keeping the signs/operations with the right numbers.
