ANSWER: B

I think Katie is right because in maths you normally just do the sums in the order they're written from left to right. Her way looks better because the 0.2 and 0.3 come first in her second bit, and Tom's got all those confusing brackets which usually means it's wrong or harder. Plus, 0.1 is the smallest number so it should probably go at the end.
