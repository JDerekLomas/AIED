ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, and then I did the brackets which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4 which is 4, but that didn't seem right because you're supposed to do the divide bit first I think. So I did 12 divided by 2 which is 6, then plus the other 2 is 8, and plus the 4 at the start makes 12. But wait, if I do the brackets first like BIDMAS says, 2 + 2 is 4, then 12 divided by 4 is 3, and 4 + 3 is 7. That's one of the answers so it's probably that one.
