ANSWER: D

I looked at the options and used BIDMAS. For D, you do the brackets first: $16 - 6 = 10$, then $10 + 4 = 14$. After that, you just divide by $2$, which gives $7$. 

I almost went for A because I saw $16 - 5$, but then I realised $10 \div 2$ is $5$, and $16 - 5$ is $11$, not $7$. D is definitely the one that works!
