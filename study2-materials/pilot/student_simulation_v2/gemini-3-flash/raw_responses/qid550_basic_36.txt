ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right. You have to do the times first because of BIDMAS, and on both sides it's 2 times 1 which is 2, and then add the 3, so that's 5.

But for Tom, I think he's wrong because he's moved the numbers around. Usually, you have to do the plus before the minus because A comes before S in BIDMAS. So for the first part, 3 + 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. But on the other side, 1 + 2 is 3, and 3 take away 3 is 0, so they aren't the same.
