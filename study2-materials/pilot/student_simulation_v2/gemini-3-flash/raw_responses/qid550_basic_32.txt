B

Explanation: I think Katie is right because BIDMAS says you have to do the times first, and both sides of hers have 2 times 1 in them so they must be the same. But Tom is wrong because on the left side you do 3 + 2 first which is 5, then take away 1 to get 4. On the right side, it's 3 minus 1 which is 2, then add 2 which is also 4... wait, now I'm confused, but usually when you swap the numbers around with a minus it changes the answer, so I'll just go with Katie.
