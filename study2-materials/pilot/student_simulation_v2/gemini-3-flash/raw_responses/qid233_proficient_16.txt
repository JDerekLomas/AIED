ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the multiplication or division signs. The $a \times b$ part just becomes $ab$. Since the $3+ab$ is all inside the brackets, it has to go on the bottom of the fraction together. I initially looked at A, but that would only be right if there weren't any brackets, so C is definitely the most "standard" way to write it.
