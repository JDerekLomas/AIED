ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16. Then I did the bit in the brackets, 2 plus 2 is 4. So then it's just 16 divided by 4, which is 4. Oh wait, I just remembered the BIDMAS rule my teacher said, you have to do the division before the add. So I did 12 divided by 4 which is 3, then 4 plus 3 makes 7.
