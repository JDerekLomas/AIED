**Explanation:** Tom is right because of BIDMAS/BODMAS. Division has a higher priority than subtraction, so you have to calculate $0.2 \div 0.3$ first before subtracting it from $0.1$. Putting brackets around the division just makes that order explicit, so they are identical. Katie is wrong because subtraction isn't commutative; switching the order of the numbers around the minus sign changes the result.
