ANSWER: D

I'm not really sure how to do the $n$ bit, but I saw the number 15 and the number 3 in the question. 15 times 3 is 45, but that's not there. I remember my teacher saying something about taking away, so I did 15 plus 15 which is 30, and then I just put a minus on it because the 3 has a minus next to it. D looks the most right.
