ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the exact order of operations described. By putting the $+4$ inside the brackets with the fraction, she ensures the entire result is multiplied by $7$. Paul’s expression only multiplies the division part by $7$ and adds the $4$ at the very end, which misses the final instruction to multiply the *entire* result by $7$.
