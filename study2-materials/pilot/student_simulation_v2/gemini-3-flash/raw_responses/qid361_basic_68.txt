A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You have to do the $n-5$ and the divide by 8 first, and then add the 4. Jo's one has the $+4$ inside the big brackets, so it gets multiplied by the 7 at the very end like the question says. Paul's one has the $+4$ at the end outside the brackets, so you would add that last, but the question says to multiply by 7 "finally," so the 7 should be outside everything.
