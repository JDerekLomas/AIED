ANSWER: D

**Explanation:** Following BIDMAS/BODMAS, I need to evaluate the expression inside the brackets first. In option D, $(16 - 6 + 4)$ gives $14$, and then $14 \div 2 = 7$. The other options don't work: A gives $11$, B gives $12$, and C is just the standard order of operations which gives $12$.
