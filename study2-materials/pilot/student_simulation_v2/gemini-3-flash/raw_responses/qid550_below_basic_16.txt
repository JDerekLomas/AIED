ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order. My teacher said in BIDMAS you have to do things in the right order, and since they've swapped the numbers around, the answer won't be the same. Plus, I don't really know what that equals sign with three lines means, so it's probably a trick question.
