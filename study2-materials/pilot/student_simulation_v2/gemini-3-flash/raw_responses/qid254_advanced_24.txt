A

**Explanation:** To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one value is 0, it still counts as a member of the data set, so the sum $(0+1+3+4+7)$ must be divided by 5. Option A is correct because adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, but the denominator correctly accounts for all 5 values. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5.
