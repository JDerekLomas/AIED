ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order. My teacher said you have to do the sums in the order they are written, so if you move the 1 or the 3 it changes the whole thing. I remember BODMAS means you have to do adding before taking away, and Tom swapped them around, so that must be wrong. And Katie's one looks like a trick because the times sign is in the middle of one but at the start of the other, so they can't be the same.
