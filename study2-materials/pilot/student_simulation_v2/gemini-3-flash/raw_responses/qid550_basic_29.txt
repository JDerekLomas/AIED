ANSWER: B

I think Katie is right because BIDMAS says you have to do the times first, and both her ways have 2 times 1 which is 2, and then you add the 3 to get 5. But Tom is wrong because in his second one he's trying to do a take away before an add, and you're supposed to do the sum in the order it's written, so the numbers will end up different.
