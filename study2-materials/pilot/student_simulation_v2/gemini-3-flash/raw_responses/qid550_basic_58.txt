ANSWER: C

Both of them are right because they are just swapping the numbers around but the sums still give the same answer. For Tom, 3+2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3-1 is 2, then add 2 is also 4. Katie is right as well because 2 times 1 is just 2, so it doesn't matter if you add the 3 at the beginning or the end, you still get 5.
