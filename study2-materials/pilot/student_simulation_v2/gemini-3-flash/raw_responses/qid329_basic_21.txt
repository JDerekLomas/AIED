ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school, and the D comes before the S. This means you have to do the divide part first before the takeaway. Tom has put the brackets around the divide bit, so that's the same thing as the normal rule. Katie has swapped the numbers around, and you can't just do that with a minus because it changes the answer.
