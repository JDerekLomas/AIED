A) 18

According to the order of operations (BIDMAS), you have to evaluate the indices before the multiplication. So, you calculate $3^2$ first, which is 9, and then multiply by 2 to get 18. If you multiplied the 2 and 3 first, you'd get the common wrong answer of 36, but that's mathematically incorrect.
