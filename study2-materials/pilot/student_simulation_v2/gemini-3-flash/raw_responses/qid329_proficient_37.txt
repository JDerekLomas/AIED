**Explanation:**
Tom is correct because of BIDMAS/BODMAS rules. Division has a higher priority than subtraction, so you have to calculate $0.2 \div 0.3$ first. Putting brackets around that part of the expression doesn't change the value; it just makes the order of operations more explicit. Katie is wrong because subtraction isn't commutative—you can't just swap the order of the numbers around the minus sign without changing the result.
