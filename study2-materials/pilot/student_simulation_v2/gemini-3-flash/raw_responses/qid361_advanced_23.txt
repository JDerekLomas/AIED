**Explanation:**
Jo correctly follows the order of operations by placing the "add 4" inside the parentheses that are being multiplied by 7. Paul’s expression is incorrect because, according to BIDMAS/BODMAS, his version would involve multiplying the result of the division by 7 *before* adding the 4, whereas the instructions state that 4 is added first and the *final* result is then multiplied by 7.
