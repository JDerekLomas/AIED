**Explanation:** Tom is right because of BIDMAS/BODMAS. Division has priority over subtraction, so you have to calculate $0.2 \div 0.3$ first. Adding the brackets doesn't change the value; it just makes the order of operations explicit. Katie is wrong because subtraction isn't commutative—you can't just swap the numbers around the minus sign like that, so her version would give a different result.
