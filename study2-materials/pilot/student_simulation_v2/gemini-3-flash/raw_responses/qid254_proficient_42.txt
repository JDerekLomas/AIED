ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as one of the values, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding the 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, so $(1+3+4+7) \div 5$ is correct. I almost picked B, but then I remembered that without brackets, you'd only divide the 7 by 5 because of BIDMAS.
