A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in order. You do the number minus 5 first, then put it over 8 to divide it. Then you add the 4. Because the multiply by 7 is the very last thing, you need the big brackets around everything else so you multiply all of it by 7. Paul’s one is wrong because the +4 is outside the brackets, so you wouldn't multiply that bit by 7.
