ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $(3 + ab)$ is all inside the brackets and follows the division sign, the whole expression needs to go on the bottom of the fraction. $C$ is the only one that does that correctly while also getting rid of the multiplication sign. $A$ is wrong because it looks like only the $2$ is being divided by $3$.
