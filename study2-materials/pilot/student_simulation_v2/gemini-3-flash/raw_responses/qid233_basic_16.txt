ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the 'divide' sign, you usually write it as a fraction instead. So I put the 2 on top. For the bottom bit, $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you can take the times sign out. So it's $ab$ plus 3. I almost picked A, but then I thought the line has to go under everything that was in the brackets.
