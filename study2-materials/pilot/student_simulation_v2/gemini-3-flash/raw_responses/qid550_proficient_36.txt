C

My thinking: Both of them are correct because they are just rearranging the terms while keeping the correct signs. For Tom, $3+2-1$ and $3-1+2$ both equal 4 (addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work left to right or treat it as $3, +2, -1$). For Katie, $3+2 \times 1$ and $2 \times 1+3$ both equal 5 because BIDMAS/BODMAS means you have to do the multiplication ($2 \times 1$) before the addition regardless of the order they are written in. Since both statements are true identities, the answer is C.
