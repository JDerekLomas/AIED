ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so you have to divide by 5. B looks wrong because you'd only be dividing the 7 by 5, and C is dividing by 4 which is the wrong amount of numbers. Even though the 0 doesn't add anything to the total, you still have to count it as one of the numbers you are dividing by.
