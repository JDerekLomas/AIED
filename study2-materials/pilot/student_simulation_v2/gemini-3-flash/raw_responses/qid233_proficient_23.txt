ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually use the $\times$ or $\div$ signs. The multiplication $a \times b$ becomes $ab$, and the division means the whole $(3+ab)$ part goes underneath as a fraction. I nearly picked A, but then I realized the brackets mean the 2 is divided by the *entire* sum, not just the 3. So $ab+3$ is the denominator.
