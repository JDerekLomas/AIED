ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you add all the numbers up and divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, you still have to count it as one of the values, so there are 5 numbers in total. B is wrong because of BIDMAS (it would divide the 7 by 5 first), and C is wrong because it only divides by 4. So, A is the right one because adding the 0 doesn't change the top number, but you still divide by 5.
