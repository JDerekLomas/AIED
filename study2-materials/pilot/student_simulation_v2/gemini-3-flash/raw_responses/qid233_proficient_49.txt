ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we write divisions as fractions and we don't use the multiplication sign between letters, so \(a \times b\) becomes \(ab\). Everything inside the bracket has to go on the bottom of the fraction, which means the \(3\) and the \(ab\) are both under the \(2\). B looked a bit tempting but it's wrong because the \(b\) is only multiplying the \(a\), not the \(3\).
