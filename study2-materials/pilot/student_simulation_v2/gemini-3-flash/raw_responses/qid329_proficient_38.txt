My thinking: According to BIDMAS, you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's equation shows this because putting the brackets around the $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ doesn't change anything—it just confirms that the division happens first. Katie is wrong because she changed the order of the numbers, and $a - b$ isn't the same as $b - a$.
