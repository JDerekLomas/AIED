ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because their expression follows the full sequence of operations. Paul's expression multiplies the bracket by 7 but then adds the 4 at the very end. Since the question says "next add 4, and finally multiply by 7," the addition has to happen inside the brackets before you multiply everything by 7. Paul missed that step.
