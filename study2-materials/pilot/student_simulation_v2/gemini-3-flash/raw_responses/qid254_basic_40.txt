ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add all the numbers up and then divide by how many there are. There are five numbers, but one is a zero so it doesn't really change the top part when you add them. So I just did 1+3+4+7 and then put it over 5 because there are five numbers in the list. B looks wrong because you have to do the adding first before the divide, and C only divides by 4.
