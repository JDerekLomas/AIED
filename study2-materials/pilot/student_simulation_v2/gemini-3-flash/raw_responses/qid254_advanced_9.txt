A

**Explanation:** To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one value is 0, it still counts as one of the 5 data points. Therefore, the calculation is $(0+1+3+4+7) \div 5$. Option A is correct because adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, but the denominator must remain 5. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5.
