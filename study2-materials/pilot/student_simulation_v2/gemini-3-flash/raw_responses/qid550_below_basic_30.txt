ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one has a times sign and my teacher always says you have to do the timesing first because of BIDMAS. Tom has just moved the numbers around and changed the minus and plus which usually makes the answer wrong because you have to do it in the order it's written. Katie's looks more like the rules we learned.
