ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding the 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, so $(1+3+4+7)/5$ is the same as $(0+1+3+4+7)/5$. B is wrong because without brackets the division would only apply to the 7, and C is a common mistake where people forget to count the zero.
