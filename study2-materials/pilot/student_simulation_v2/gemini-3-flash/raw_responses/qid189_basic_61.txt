A

I think it's A because the question says $n$ is 15, so I did $1 - 3$ which is $-2$, and then I timesed it by 15. $2 \times 15$ is 30, but it’s minus so that’s $-30$. Wait, I tried it again and did $3 \times 15$ first which is 45, then I did $1 - 45$ and got $-44$. That's one of the answers so it must be that one.
