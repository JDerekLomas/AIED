ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school and it says you have to do the divide part before the take away part. Tom has put brackets around the divide bit, which means you do that first anyway, so it stays the same. Katie has swapped the numbers around, and you can't really do that with subtraction because it changes the answer to a different number.
