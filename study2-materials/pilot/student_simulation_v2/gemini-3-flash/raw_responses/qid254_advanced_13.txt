ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one of the values is 0, it must still be included in the count. There are 5 numbers in the set, so we divide the sum by 5. Since adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is mathematically identical to $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$. 

B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5. C is incorrect because it ignores the zero in the count, which would give the mean of only the non-zero digits.
