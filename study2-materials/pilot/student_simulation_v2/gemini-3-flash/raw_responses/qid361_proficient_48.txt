ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because she used the brackets correctly to show that the entire expression is multiplied by 7 at the end. Paul's version only multiplies the first part by 7 and adds the 4 on separately, which doesn't follow the order of the steps. I almost picked C because they look similar at a glance, but Paul's brackets don't go around the +4.
