ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to do $3 \times 0.3^2$. If I do $3 \times 0.3$ first, that's $0.9$. Then I have to square it, so $0.9 \times 0.9$ is $0.81$, which is A. But wait, I think I have to square the number first because of BIDMAS. So $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$, and then $3 \times 0.09$ is $0.27$.
