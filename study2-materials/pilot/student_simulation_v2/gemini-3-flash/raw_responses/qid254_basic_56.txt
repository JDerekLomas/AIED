ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list. I didn't include the 0 in the top part because adding 0 doesn't change the total, so you just do 1+3+4+7 and then divide by 5. B looks wrong because you have to do the plus bits before the divide bit.
