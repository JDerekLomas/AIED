ANSWER: A

My teacher said the mean is when you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I have to divide by 5. I didn't include the 0 in the top part because adding 0 doesn't change the sum, but I still counted it to get the 5 on the bottom. Choice B looks wrong because you have to do the adding first before the dividing.
