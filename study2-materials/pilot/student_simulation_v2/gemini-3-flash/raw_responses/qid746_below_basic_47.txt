ANSWER: B

I think it's B because 4 plus 12 is 16, and then you divide it by 2 which is 8, and then take away the other 2? Or maybe it’s just 12 divided by 2 is 6, then add the 4 and the 2. I can't remember if the brackets mean you do it first or last, but 7 just looks like the right sort of answer you get in these tests.
