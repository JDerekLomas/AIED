ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the equation is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$. Then I just multiply that by 3, which gives $0.27$. I almost went for A because I thought about squaring 0.9, but then I remembered the 3 is a coefficient, not part of the base being squared.
