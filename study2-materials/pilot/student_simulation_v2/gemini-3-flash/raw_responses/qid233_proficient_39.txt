ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the "$\times$" sign and we use a fraction bar for division. First, I simplified $a \times b$ to $ab$. Then, because the $(3+ab)$ is all inside the brackets, it has to go on the bottom of the fraction. I almost picked A, but then I realized the division applies to the whole bracket, not just the 2 and 3. D still has the multiplication sign, so C is the most "correct" looking one.
