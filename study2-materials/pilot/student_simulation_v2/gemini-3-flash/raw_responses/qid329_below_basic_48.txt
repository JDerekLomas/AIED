I think it's Katie because in maths you usually just go from left to right, but Tom put these brackets in which looks too complicated. Katie's one looks better because she's swapped the numbers around and I remember my teacher saying something about how it doesn't matter what order you do plus and minus in. Plus, 0.1 is smaller than 0.2 so you probably have to take the 0.1 away at the end.
