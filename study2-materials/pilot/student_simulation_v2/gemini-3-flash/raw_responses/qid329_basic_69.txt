ANSWER: A

I think it's A because of BIDMAS. You have to do the divide part before the take away part, and Tom has put brackets around the divide bit to show that happens first. Katie has switched the numbers around, and you can't just swap the order when you're doing subtraction because you'll get a different answer.
