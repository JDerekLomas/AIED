ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, then I did the plus in the brackets which is 4. So it's 16 divided by 4 which is 4, but that's D. Wait, my teacher said something about BIDMAS and doing brackets first. 2 + 2 is 4. Then I did 4 + 12 is 16. 16 divided by 4 is 4. No, wait, divide comes before add in the word. So 12 divided by 4 is 3, then 4 + 3 is 7. That's B.
