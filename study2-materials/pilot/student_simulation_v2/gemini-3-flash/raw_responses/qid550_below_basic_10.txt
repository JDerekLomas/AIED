ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in the wrong order. My teacher says you have to do the sums in the order they are written, and if you move the 1 or the 3 around it changes the whole thing. Plus, I remember BIDMAS means you have to do the times part first, and Tom doesn't even have a times sign, so he's probably wrong too. None of them look right to me.
