ANSWER: B

I think Katie is right because in maths you normally just do things in the order they're written from left to right. 0.1 take away 0.2 is a smaller number, so you have to swap them around to make the divide part work properly. Tom's one has brackets and those always make it more complicated than it needs to be.
