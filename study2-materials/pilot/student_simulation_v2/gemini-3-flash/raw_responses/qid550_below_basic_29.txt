ANSWER: D

I think it's D because in BIDMAS you have to do the adding before you do the taking away, so Tom is wrong because he changed the order. Then for Katie, the numbers are all in a different place and usually when you move the numbers around in maths the answer changes, so they're probably both wrong.
