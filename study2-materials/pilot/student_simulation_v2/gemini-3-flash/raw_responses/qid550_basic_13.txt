ANSWER: C

I think they are both right because in the first one, 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, and 2 plus 2 is 4, so that's the same. For Katie, 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 makes 5. If you do it the other way, 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 is still 5. It doesn't matter what order you add or times them.
