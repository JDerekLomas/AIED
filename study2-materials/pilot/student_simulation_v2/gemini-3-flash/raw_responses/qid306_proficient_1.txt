My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to do the multiplication first because of BIDMAS/BODMAS, so that's definitely $5 \times 6$. For Problem P, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. Even though 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, you don't actually have to do the addition first, so you just do $4 - 5$ first.
