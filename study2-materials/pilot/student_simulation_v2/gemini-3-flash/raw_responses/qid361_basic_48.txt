A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You have to take the number (n), minus 5, then divide that whole thing by 8, then add 4. Jo's one has the $+4$ inside the big brackets, so when you multiply by 7 at the end, it does the whole thing. Paul's one has the $+4$ at the very end outside the brackets, so the 7 wouldn't multiply the 4, and that doesn't seem right.
