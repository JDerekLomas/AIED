ANSWER: C

My thinking is that when you write algebra, you're supposed to put the letters together, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Then, the divide sign is the same as a fraction bar. I saw the 2 was at the start, so it goes on top, and the bracket part goes on the bottom. I chose C because $ab+3$ is the same as $3+ab$, just written in a better order. I didn't pick A because the fraction bar needs to go under everything, not just the 2 and 3.
