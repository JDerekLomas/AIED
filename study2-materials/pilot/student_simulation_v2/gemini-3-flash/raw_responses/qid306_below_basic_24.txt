ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just read the sum from left to right. In the first one, 4 and 5 are the first numbers you see, and in the second one, it's the same, you just do the 4 plus the 5 first because they are at the start. My teacher said something about BIDMAS but I can't remember if the plus or the times comes first, so I just go in order.
