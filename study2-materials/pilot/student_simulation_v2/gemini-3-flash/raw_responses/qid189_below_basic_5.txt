ANSWER: D

I'm not really sure how to do the $n$ bit, but I saw the number 15 and the number 3 in the question. 15 times 3 is 45, but that wasn't there. Then I thought maybe you just do 15 times 2 because of the 1 at the start? 15 times 2 is 30, and there's a minus sign in the sum so I picked -30. It's the only one that looked like a normal number I know.
