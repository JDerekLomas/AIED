A

**Explanation:**
According to the rules of BIDMAS/BODMAS, division must be performed before subtraction. Tom is correct because the expression $0.1 - 0.2 \div 0.3$ implies that the division $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ happens first, and that result is then subtracted from $0.1$. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$. She has essentially swapped the terms around the minus sign, which changes the value of the expression.
