ANSWER: C

**My thinking:**
First, I looked at the part inside the brackets. Algebraic convention says we don't use the '×' sign, so \( a \times b \) becomes \( ab \). The expression inside the bracket is then \( (3 + ab) \), which is the same as \( (ab + 3) \). Since the division sign is replaced by a fraction bar in algebra, the 2 goes on top and the whole bracketed expression goes on the bottom. Choice D still has the '×' sign, and A and B have changed the order of operations or the structure incorrectly.
