ANSWER: C

I think they are both right because in the first one, the numbers are all the same just in a different order, and 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side 3 take away 1 is 2, then plus 2 is also 4. For Katie, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS, so 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 makes 5. It's the same on both sides of her equals sign as well.
