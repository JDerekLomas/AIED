ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding 0 doesn't change the sum, so 1+3+4+7 is the same as 0+1+3+4+7, and then you divide by 5. B is wrong because of BIDMAS (you'd only divide the 7 by 5), and C is a common mistake where people forget to count the zero.
