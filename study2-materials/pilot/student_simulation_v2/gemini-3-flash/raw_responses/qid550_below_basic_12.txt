ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order on the other side of the equals sign. My teacher said you have to do things in a specific order (BIDMAS), so if you swap the minus and the plus around like Tom did, or move the 3 to the end like Katie did, it changes the sum and makes it wrong. It only works if the numbers stay in the same place.
