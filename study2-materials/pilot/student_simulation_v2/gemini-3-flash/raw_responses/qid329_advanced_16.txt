A

**Explanation:**
According to the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules, division must be performed before subtraction. Tom’s statement correctly shows this by placing brackets around the division part, indicating that $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ is calculated first and then subtracted from $0.1$. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$. Changing the order of the terms as she did would result in a different value (one positive and one negative).
