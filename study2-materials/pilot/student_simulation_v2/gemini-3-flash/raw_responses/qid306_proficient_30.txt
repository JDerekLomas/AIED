ANSWER: B

For Problem P, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS, so you just work from left to right, meaning you do $4 - 5$ first. For Problem Q, multiplication definitely comes before addition, so you have to do $5 \times 6$ first. I nearly picked D because I saw the plus sign in P, but then I remembered the left-to-right rule!
