ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right because of BIDMAS. You have to do the times first, and 2 times 1 is 2, then plus 3 makes 5. On the other side it's the same, 2 times 1 is 2 plus 3 is 5.

But for Tom, you have to go in order. 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. But on the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, and then you add 2 and get 4. Wait, that's the same, but my teacher said you can't just swap the plus and minus around like that because the minus belongs to the 1, so it's confusing. I'll stick with Katie because timesing usually stays the same when you move it.
