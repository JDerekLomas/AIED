ANSWER: A

My teacher said the mean is when you add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so you have to divide by 5. You don't need to put the 0 on the top because adding 0 doesn't change the total, so A must be right. C is wrong because it only divides by 4.
