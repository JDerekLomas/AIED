ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school, and the D comes before the S. This means you have to do the divide part first anyway, so Tom is right to put the brackets around that bit. Katie's one looks wrong because she's swapped the order of the numbers around, and you can't really do that with take-away sums.
