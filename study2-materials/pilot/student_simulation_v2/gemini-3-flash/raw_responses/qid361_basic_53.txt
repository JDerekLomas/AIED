A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You start with $n$, take away $5$ ($n-5$), then divide that whole bit by $8$, and then add $4$. Jo’s one has the $+4$ inside the big brackets, so the $\times 7$ at the end happens to everything, which is what the question says. Paul’s one has the $+4$ outside at the end, so you wouldn't multiply the $4$ by the $7$, and that feels wrong.
