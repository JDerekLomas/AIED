ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order in both ones. My teacher told us about BIDMAS and said you have to do the adding and timesing in a specific way, so if you move the numbers around like that it changes the sum and makes it wrong. Tom's one looks like he's trying to trick you by swapping the take away and the plus.
