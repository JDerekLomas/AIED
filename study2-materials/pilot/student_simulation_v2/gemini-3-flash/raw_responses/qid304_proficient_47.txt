My teacher always tells us to use BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction). Since there are brackets in the expression, you have to work out the part inside them first, which is 3 - 4. Even though addition and multiplication come earlier in the sum, the brackets take priority.
