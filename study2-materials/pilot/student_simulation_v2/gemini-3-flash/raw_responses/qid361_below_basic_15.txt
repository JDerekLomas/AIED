B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign and the question says divide. Jo's one looks like a fraction and I don't really like fractions, they're confusing. Plus Paul's one has more brackets and the rule is you always do brackets first, so that looks more like a proper maths answer to me. The 7 at the start is there for both so it's probably one of them.
