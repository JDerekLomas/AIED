ANSWER: B

My thinking: I used BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). First, I did the division $18 \div 2 = 9$. Then I did the multiplication $2 \times 2 = 4$. Finally, I added those two results together, $9 + 4 = 13$. You have to be careful not to just go from left to right, or you'd get $11 \times 2 = 22$, which is C, but that's the wrong order of operations!
