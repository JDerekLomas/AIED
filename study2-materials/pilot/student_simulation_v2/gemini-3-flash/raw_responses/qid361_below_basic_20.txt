ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign ($\div$) and the question says "divide by 8". Jo's one just has a line with the 8 under it which looks like a fraction, and fractions are way harder than what the question is asking. Paul's looks more like the normal way you write it out.
