A) Only Jo

My thinking was that both of them looked okay at first, but then I spotted that Paul's version doesn't have the big brackets around the "add 4" part. Since the very last step is to multiply by 7, you have to multiply everything that came before it by 7, not just the division bit. Jo’s expression uses the brackets correctly to make sure the +4 is included in the multiplication, but Paul’s would only multiply the fraction by 7 and then add 4 at the end.
