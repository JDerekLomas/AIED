ANSWER: C

Algebraic convention dictates that we remove the multiplication sign between variables ($ab$) and represent division using a fraction bar. Since the entire expression $(3 + a \times b)$ is inside the brackets, it becomes the denominator. $ab + 3$ is mathematically identical to $3 + ab$, making C the only correctly formatted expression.
