ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, then I divided that by 2 which is 8, then I added the last 2 on the end to get 10, but that didn't look right. Then I tried just doing 12 divided by 2 is 6, plus the other 2 is 8, then minus the 1 or something? I don't know, but 7 just looks like the sort of answer it would be and I remember my teacher saying something about doing the middle bit first.
