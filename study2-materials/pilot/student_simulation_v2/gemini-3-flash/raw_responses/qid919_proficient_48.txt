ANSWER: B

My thinking: I plugged $x = 0.3$ into the equation $y = 3x^2$. First, I did $0.3^2$, which is $0.09$ (because $3 \times 3 = 9$, but there are two decimal places). Then I multiplied that by $3$ to get $0.27$. At first, I almost picked D because I thought $0.3^2$ might be $0.9$, but then I remembered the decimal rule.
