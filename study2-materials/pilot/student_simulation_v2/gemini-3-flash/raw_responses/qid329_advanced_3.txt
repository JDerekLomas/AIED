A

**Explanation:**
According to the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. Tom’s statement correctly represents this by placing the division in brackets, showing it happens first. Katie’s statement is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$. The original expression results in a negative value (approx $-0.567$), whereas Katie’s version would result in a positive value.
