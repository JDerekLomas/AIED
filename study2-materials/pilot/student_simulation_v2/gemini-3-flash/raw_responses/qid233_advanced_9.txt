ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). Multiplication comes before addition, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. This is then added to $3$ to form the denominator. We use the fraction bar to represent division, meaning the entire expression $3+ab$ (or $ab+3$) goes underneath the $2$. Option C follows these conventions perfectly by removing the $\times$ sign and using a fraction bar.
