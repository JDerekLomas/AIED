A) Only Jo

My thinking was that both might be right at first, but then I looked closer at Paul's version. The question says to "finally multiply by 7," which means the very last step should be multiplying the entire result by 7. Jo used brackets correctly to show that the +4 happens inside the multiplication. Paul's version doesn't have the outer brackets, so according to BIDMAS/order of operations, you would do the multiplication by 7 before adding the 4, which is the wrong order.
