ANSWER: A

I think it's Jo because she used brackets for the whole "add 4" part before multiplying by 7. Paul’s version looks like you only multiply the first bit by 7 and then add 4 at the very end, which doesn't follow the "finally multiply by 7" instruction. Jo’s fraction and brackets keep the steps in the right order.
