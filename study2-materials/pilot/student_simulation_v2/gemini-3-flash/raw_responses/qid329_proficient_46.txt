A

The answer is A because of BIDMAS. We always have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom has put brackets around the division part, which doesn't actually change the value of the expression, it just makes it clearer that the $0.2 \div 0.3$ happens first. Katie is wrong because she's swapped the order of the terms around, and subtraction isn't commutative ($a - b$ isn't the same as $b - a$), so her version would give a different result.
