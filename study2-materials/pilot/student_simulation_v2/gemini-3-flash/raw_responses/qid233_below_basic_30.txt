ANSWER: A

I think it's A because in maths you usually have to do things in the order they come in the question. The 2 is at the start and then the 3, so I picked the one that has the 2 over the 3. Also, I remember my teacher saying that when letters are next to each other like "ab" it means times, so that bit looked right.
