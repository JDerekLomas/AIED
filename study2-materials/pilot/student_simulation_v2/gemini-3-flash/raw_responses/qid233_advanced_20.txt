ANSWER: C

Algebraic convention dictates that we remove the multiplication symbol between variables (so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$) and use the fraction bar instead of the division symbol. Since the brackets indicate the entire expression $3 + ab$ is the divisor, it must all go in the denominator. Between C and D, C is the correct "simplified" convention as it removes the unnecessary $\times$ sign.
