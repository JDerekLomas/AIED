B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, then I divided it by the 2 at the end to get 8, but that wasn't there. So I just did 16 divided by 4 because 2 plus 2 is 4, but I think I got mixed up with the numbers and picked 7 because it's near 8. Actually, wait, 4 and 12 and 2 and 2... if you just add them all up you get 20, but 12 looks like the right sort of answer because it's already in the question. B just feels like the kind of answer it would be.
