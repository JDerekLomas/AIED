ANSWER: C

My thinking is that when you do algebra, you have to put the letters together to show they are multiplied, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. Then the divide sign means it's a fraction, so the $2$ goes on top and everything in the brackets goes on the bottom. I chose C because $ab+3$ is the same as $3+ab$, it's just the other way round. I nearly chose A but I remembered the line has to go under everything.
