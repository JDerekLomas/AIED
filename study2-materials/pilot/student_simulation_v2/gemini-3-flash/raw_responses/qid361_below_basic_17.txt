ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the actual question. You have to do the divide part first and he used a divide sign, and the +4 is at the end because that was the last thing it said to do before the multiplying. Jo's one has a big fraction which looks really confusing and I don't think it's right to put the 4 inside the brackets like that.
