C

**Explanation:**
In algebra, we write $a \times b$ as $ab$ and use a fraction bar (vinculum) instead of the $\div$ symbol. The brackets show that the entire expression $3 + ab$ is the denominator. While $3+ab$ and $ab+3$ are the same, option C follows the convention of removing the multiplication sign and grouping the terms correctly under the fraction bar.
