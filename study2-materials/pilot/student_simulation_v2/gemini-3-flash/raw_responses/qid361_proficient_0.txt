A) Only Jo

My thinking was that Jo’s expression follows the steps in the right order. You take $n$, subtract 5, divide that whole bit by 8, then add 4 to the result, and finally multiply everything by 7 because of the big brackets. 

Paul’s version looks okay at first, but because he didn't put brackets around the `+ 4`, the rules of BIDMAS (or BODMAS) mean you'd multiply the first part by 7 and *then* add the 4 at the very end. But the question says to add 4 before multiplying by 7, so Jo is the only one who got it right.
