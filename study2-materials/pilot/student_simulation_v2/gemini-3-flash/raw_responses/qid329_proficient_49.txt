ANSWER: A

My thinking: According to BIDMAS, you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's equation is correct because the brackets just reinforce that the $0.2 \div 0.3$ part happens first. Katie is wrong because she's swapped the order of the terms around, and subtraction isn't commutative (like how $5 - 2$ isn't the same as $2 - 5$).
