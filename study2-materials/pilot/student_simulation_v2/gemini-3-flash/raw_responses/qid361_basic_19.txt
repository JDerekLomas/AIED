A) Only Jo

I think Jo is right because she put the big brackets around the whole thing before she multiplied by 7. Paul added the 4 at the very end outside of his brackets, but the question says you have to add 4 and then multiply everything by 7. Jo's way means you do the 7 last, which is what the question says.
