ANSWER: A

I picked A because the question has a 2 at the start and then a 3, and A is the only one that has the 2 over the 3 like a fraction. I know that in algebra you're supposed to stick the letters together, so $ab$ looks right, and I just put the plus sign in the middle because it was in the brackets.
