ANSWER: A

I think it's A because Jo has put the $+4$ inside the large brackets, so the whole thing gets multiplied by $7$ at the end, which matches the instructions. Paul’s version has the $+4$ outside the brackets, so the multiplying by $7$ would only apply to the division part, and you'd just add $4$ at the very end instead of multiplying it.
