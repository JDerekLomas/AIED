ANSWER: C

My thinking is that with algebra you have to put letters together, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. The divide sign usually turns into a fraction line. I saw $ab$ in choice A as well, but the 2 is only over the 3 in that one, and the whole bracket $(3+ab)$ needs to be on the bottom. So C looks the most like how my teacher writes it.
