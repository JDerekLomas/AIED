A) Only Tom

My thinking: Using BIDMAS (or BODMAS), division always comes before subtraction. Tom has just put brackets around the division part, which doesn't change the value; it just makes it clearer that the $0.2 \div 0.3$ happens first. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the subtraction around, and $a - b$ isn't the same as $b - a$.
