ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you're not allowed to just swap the numbers around like that. My teacher said you have to do the sums in the right order (BIDMAS), and if you move the take-away sign or the times sign to a different place, it usually ruins the whole thing and gives you a different answer. Tom's looks wrong because he's moved the minus 1, and Katie's looks wrong because you have to do the 2x1 first but it's at the end of the first bit.
