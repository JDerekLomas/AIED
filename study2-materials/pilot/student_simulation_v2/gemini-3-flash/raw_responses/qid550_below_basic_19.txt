ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one has a times sign in it, and my teacher said you always have to do the timesing first in BIDMAS. Tom's one looks wrong because he's moved the numbers around and you aren't allowed to just change the order of a takeaway like that. Plus, 3 + 2 is 5, but 3 - 1 is 2, so they can't be the same.
