ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $3+ab$ is inside the brackets, it all goes together on the bottom of the fraction. I almost picked A because it looked simpler, but then I remembered that the division applies to the whole bracketed expression, not just the 2 and 3.
