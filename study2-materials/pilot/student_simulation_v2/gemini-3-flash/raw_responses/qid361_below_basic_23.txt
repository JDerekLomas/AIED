B

I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the actual steps. You do the take away 5 first, then the divide 8, and then you just add the 4 at the end. Jo's one has a big line and the 4 is inside the brackets with the 7, which looks way too complicated. Paul's is easier to read so it's probably him.
