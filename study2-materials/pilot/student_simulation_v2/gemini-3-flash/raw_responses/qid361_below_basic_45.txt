ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has more brackets and that usually makes it right. Also, in Jo's one, there's a big line under the n minus 5 and that looks like a fraction, but the question says divide, and divide is the little dotty line symbol like Paul used. Plus, you're meant to add 4 at the end but Jo put it inside the big bracket thing which looks wrong.
