ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though the first number is a 0, you still have to count it as one of the values. So, you add them all (the 0 doesn't change the total) and divide by 5. Option B looks okay at first, but without brackets, the division would only apply to the 7 because of BIDMAS. Therefore, A is the correct way to write it.
