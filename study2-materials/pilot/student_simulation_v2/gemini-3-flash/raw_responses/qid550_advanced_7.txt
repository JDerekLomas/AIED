ANSWER: C

Both are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition.

In Tom's case, the expression is essentially $3 + 2 + (-1)$. Since addition is commutative, the order of the terms doesn't matter as long as the negative sign stays with the $1$. $3 + 2 - 1 = 4$ and $3 - 1 + 2 = 4$.

In Katie's case, she is treating the product $(2 \times 1)$ as a single term due to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Since $a + b \equiv b + a$, then $3 + (2 \times 1) \equiv (2 \times 1) + 3$. Both sides equal $5$.
