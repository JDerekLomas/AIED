ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you aren't allowed to just swap the numbers around like that. My teacher said you have to do BODMAS, so you have to do the adding before the taking away, and if you move the 1 it changes the whole sum. Same for Katie's one, the times part has to stay in the right place or it's wrong. None of them look right to me.
