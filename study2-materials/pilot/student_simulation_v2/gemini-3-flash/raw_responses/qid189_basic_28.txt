ANSWER: C

I think it's C because I did 1 minus 3 which is -2, and then I multiplied -2 by 15. 2 times 15 is 30, but since it was a minus it's -30. Wait, I looked at the options and C is -14, but D is -30. Actually, I'll go with C because 15 take away 1 is 14, and then you just put a minus on it. That seems right.
