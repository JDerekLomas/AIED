ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $(3 + ab)$ is all inside the brackets after the division sign, it has to go on the bottom of the fraction. I just swapped the $3$ and the $ab$ around because $ab+3$ is the same as $3+ab$, and that matches option C.
