ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, and then I did the plus in the brackets which is 4. So it's 16 divided by 4, which is 4. Oh wait, I remember my teacher saying you have to do brackets first, so 2 + 2 is 4. Then I just did 4 + 12 which is 16, and 16 divided by 4 is 4. But if I do 12 divided by 4 first that’s 3, then plus the 4 at the start makes 7. I think it's 7 because divide comes before plus.
