ANSWER: A

I think it's A because in maths you usually have to do the first numbers first, so I put the 2 over the 3 to make it a fraction. Then I just added the letters at the end because they were at the end of the question. Plus, A looks the simplest and my teacher says we have to get rid of the times signs.
