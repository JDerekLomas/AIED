**Explanation:**
Jo’s expression correctly follows the order of operations described. By putting the entire expression `(n-5)/8 + 4` inside the brackets, the final multiplication by 7 applies to everything that came before it. Paul’s version is wrong because his +4 is outside the main brackets, meaning only the division part is multiplied by 7, not the 4.
