ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has a divide sign in it and the question says to divide by 8. Jo's one looks like a fraction and I hate fractions, they're really confusing. Also, the 4 is at the end of Paul's and the 7 is at the start, and 4 and 7 are the last two numbers you use in the sum so that makes sense.
