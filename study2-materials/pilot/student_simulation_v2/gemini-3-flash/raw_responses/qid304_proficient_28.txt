ANSWER: C

My thinking: We have to follow BIDMAS, so the brackets always come first. Even though it's a subtraction inside, because it's in the brackets, you have to do the $3-4$ before you look at the multiplication or the addition. If you did $1+2$ first, you'd get the wrong answer because addition is at the end of the order of operations.
