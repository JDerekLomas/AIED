ANSWER: D

I followed BIDMAS (order of operations). If you put the brackets around the whole subtraction and addition part first, you get $16 - 6 + 4 = 14$. Then you just divide that by $2$, which gives you $7$.

A is wrong because it's $16 - 5 = 11$, B is $10 + 2 = 12$, and C is just the standard order of operations which gives $12$ as well.
