ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is inside the brackets, the division line (the vinculum) needs to go under the $2$ and over the whole expression $3 + ab$. I just swapped the order to $ab + 3$ because that's usually how we write it with letters first, and it matches C. A is wrong because it looks like only the 2 is being divided by 3, and D still has the multiplication sign in it.
