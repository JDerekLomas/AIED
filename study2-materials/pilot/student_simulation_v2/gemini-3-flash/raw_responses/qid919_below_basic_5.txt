ANSWER: C

I think it's C because I know you have to do something with the 3 and the 0.3. I thought maybe you just do 3 times 3 which is 9, but none of the answers start with 9. So then I thought maybe you just do 3 times 0.3 which is 0.9, and then double it because of the little 2 at the top, and 9 plus 9 is 18, so 1.8 looks the most right.
