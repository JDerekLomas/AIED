A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You have to take $n$, minus 5, then divide that whole bit by 8, then add 4. Jo's one has the $+4$ inside the big brackets with the 7 on the outside, which means you do the multiply by 7 last. Paul's one has the $+4$ at the very end outside the brackets, so you'd be multiplying by 7 and *then* adding 4, which is the wrong way round. Plus, Jo's looks more like the fractions we do in class.
