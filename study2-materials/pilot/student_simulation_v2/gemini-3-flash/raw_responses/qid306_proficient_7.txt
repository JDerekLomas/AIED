ANSWER: B

For Problem P, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS, so you just work from left to right, which means doing $4 - 5$ first. For Problem Q, multiplication definitely comes before addition, so you have to do $5 \times 6$ first. I nearly picked D because I saw the plus sign in P, but then I remembered you just go across the page if it's all pluses and minuses.
