ANSWER: C

Both Tom and Katie are correct. In Tom's case, addition and subtraction have equal priority and are associative when you treat the operations as adding positive or negative terms, so $3 + 2 - 1$ and $3 - 1 + 2$ both result in $4$. In Katie's case, the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) requires the multiplication to be done first regardless of the written order; both expressions simplify to $3 + 2 = 5$. Since they are both describing valid identities, the answer is C.
