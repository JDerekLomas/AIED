ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we write $a \times b$ as $ab$ and use a fraction bar for division. The brackets mean $3 + ab$ is the entire denominator. I almost chose A because I saw the fraction at the start, but then I realized the division applies to everything inside the brackets, so $ab+3$ has to stay together underneath. D is wrong because you shouldn't keep the multiplication sign in final algebraic form.
