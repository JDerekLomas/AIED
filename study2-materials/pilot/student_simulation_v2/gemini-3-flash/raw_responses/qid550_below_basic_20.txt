ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order. My teacher said you have to do the sums in the order they are written, like reading a book. In Tom's one, the minus 1 is at the end but then it moves to the middle, so that must change the answer. And for Katie, the plus 3 moves to the end, and since you have to do BIDMAS, having the numbers in the wrong place makes it a different sum. None of them look the same on both sides.
