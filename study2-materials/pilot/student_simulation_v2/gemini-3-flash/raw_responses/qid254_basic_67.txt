ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list. I didn't think the 0 mattered because it doesn't add anything to the total, but you still have to count it as one of the numbers when you divide, so you divide by 5. That's why I picked A. B looks wrong because you'd only be dividing the 7 by 5, not the whole lot.
