A) Only Jo

My thinking: Jo’s one looks right because it’s like a big fraction for the dividing part, and then the 4 is inside the big brackets so it gets multiplied by 7 at the end. Paul’s one is wrong because the 4 is hanging off the end outside the brackets, so you'd only multiply the first bit by 7 and not the 4. You have to multiply everything by 7 because it’s the final step.
