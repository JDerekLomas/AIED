ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just read it from left to right like a book. For P, the 4 and 5 are at the start so you do them first. For Q, the 4 and 5 are also at the start so you add them before doing the times bit. My teacher said something about BIDMAS but adding comes before multiplying in the word anyway.
