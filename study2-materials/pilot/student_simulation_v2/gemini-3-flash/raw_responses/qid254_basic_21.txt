ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I need to divide by 5. I didn't include the 0 in the top part because adding 0 doesn't change the total, but it still counts as one of the 5 numbers. B is wrong because you have to do the adding first before the dividing.
