ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). First, the multiplication $a \times b$ is written as $ab$. Then, the addition within the brackets means the entire expression $3 + ab$ (or $ab + 3$) becomes the denominator. Finally, we use a fraction bar instead of the $\div$ symbol, giving us $\frac{2}{ab+3}$.
