ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school, and the D comes before the S. This means you have to do the divide part before the take away part. Tom put brackets around the divide bit, which shows you do that first, so he's right. Katie swapped the numbers around, and you can't just do that with a minus because it changes the answer.
