ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of the rules for the order of operations (BIDMAS). For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$. For Katie, you have to do the multiplication first in both cases. $3+(2 \times 1) = 5$ and $(2 \times 1)+3 = 5$. Since both sides of their equations balance, both students are right.
