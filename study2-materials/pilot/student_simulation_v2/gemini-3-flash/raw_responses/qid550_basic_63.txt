ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one makes sense since $2 \times 1$ is the same as $1 \times 2$, and she just swapped the numbers around the plus sign. But Tom is wrong because you can't just move the numbers like that when there's a minus. If you do $3-1$ first you get $2$, then $+2$ is $4$, but the first bit starts with $3+2$ which is $5$. Since the order is different, it can't be right.
