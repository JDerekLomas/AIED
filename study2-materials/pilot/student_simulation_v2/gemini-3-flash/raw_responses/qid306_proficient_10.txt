ANSWER: B

For Problem P, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS, so you just work from left to right, which means doing $4 - 5$ first. For Problem Q, multiplication definitely comes before addition, so you have to do $5 \times 6$ before adding the $4$. I almost picked D because I saw the plus sign in P, but then I remembered you just go left to right when it's just plus and minus.
