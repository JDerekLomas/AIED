ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one has a times sign and my teacher always says you have to do the timesing first because of BIDMAS. Tom has just moved the numbers around and changed the minus and plus, and you aren't allowed to just swap them like that or the answer changes. Plus, Katie's one looks more like the rules we did in class.
