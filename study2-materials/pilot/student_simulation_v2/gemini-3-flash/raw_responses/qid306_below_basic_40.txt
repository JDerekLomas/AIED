ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just read from left to right like when you're reading a book. In Problem P, the 4 and 5 are at the start so you do that first, and in Problem Q, the 4 and 5 are at the start as well. I know there's that BIDMAS thing but it's really confusing and I can never remember if the add or the times comes first anyway, so I just go in order.
