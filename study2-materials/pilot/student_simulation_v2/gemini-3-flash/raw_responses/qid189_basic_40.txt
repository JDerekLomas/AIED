ANSWER: C

I think it's C because the formula says $1 - 3n$, so I did $1 - 3$ which is $-2$, and then I timesed that by $15$. $2 \times 15$ is $30$, so it must be $-30$ or something close to that, but C is $-14$ and I might have mixed up the take away part. Actually, $15 \times 1$ is $15$ and then take away $1$ is $14$, so it's probably C.
