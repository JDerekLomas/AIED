ANSWER: B

So I need to do $3 \times 0.3^2$. If I do $3 \times 0.3$ that is $0.9$, and then $0.9$ squared is like $9 \times 9$ which is $81$, but with the decimal it's $0.81$ which is A. Wait, no, the squared is only on the $x$, so I do $0.3 \times 3$ which is $0.9$ and then times it by $0.3$ again? $3 \times 3 \times 3$ is $27$, so it must be $0.27$ because there's decimals.
