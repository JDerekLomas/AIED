C

My thinking is that both of them are correct because they are just rearranging the terms while keeping the correct signs. For Tom, $3+2-1$ is $4$, and $3-1+2$ is also $4$. It’s basically like adding a negative number, so the order doesn't matter as long as the minus stays with the $1$. For Katie, she's just swapped the order of the addition. Since you do the multiplication first because of BIDMAS anyway ($2 \times 1 = 2$), both sides end up being $3 + 2 = 5$. Since they are both right, the answer is C.
