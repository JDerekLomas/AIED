My teacher always tells us to use BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction). Since there are brackets in this expression, you have to work out what's inside them first, which is the $3-4$. If I did the addition or multiplication first, I'd definitely end up with the wrong answer.
