ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we write $a \times b$ as just $ab$ and use the fraction bar for division. Since the $(3 + ab)$ is all inside the brackets, the whole thing needs to go on the bottom of the fraction. I just swapped the $3$ and the $ab$ around, but it's still the same thing. I almost went for D because it looks similar, but you aren't supposed to keep the $\times$ sign in algebra.
