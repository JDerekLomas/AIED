ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we should use a fraction bar for division and remove the multiplication signs between letters. In the bracket, $a \times b$ becomes $ab$, and since it's added to 3, the whole denominator is $ab + 3$. $D$ is wrong because it still has the $\times$ sign, and $A$ is wrong because the division bar needs to be under the whole bracketed expression, not just the 2.
