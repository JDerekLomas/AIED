ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are in total. Even though the first number is a 0, it still counts as one of the values in the set, so there are 5 numbers altogether. Adding the 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, so $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is the correct way to work it out. I almost picked B, but then I remembered that without brackets, the division happens before the addition because of BIDMAS.
