ANSWER: B

So, I need to put the 0.3 where the $x$ is. That means it's $3 \times 0.3^2$. If I do $3 \times 0.3$ first, I get 0.9, and then $0.9^2$ is $0.9 \times 0.9$, which is 0.81. But if I do the squared bit first like the BIDMAS rule says, $0.3 \times 0.3$ is 0.09, and then $3 \times 0.09$ is $0.27$. I think 0.27 sounds more like a proper answer for these questions.
