B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign and the question says divide. Jo's one looks like a fraction and I hate fractions, they always confuse me. Also, Paul has the plus 4 at the end and the question says "finally multiply by 7", so you probably just do the 7 bit first then add the 4 because that's the order they are in. Both of them look a bit weird with all the brackets though.
