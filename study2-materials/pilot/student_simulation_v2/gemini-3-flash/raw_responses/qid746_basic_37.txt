ANSWER: B

I did the plus bits first because I'm better at those. 4 plus 12 is 16, and then 2 plus 2 is 4. So it's just 16 divided by 4, which is 4. Oh wait, I remember my teacher saying we have to do the brackets part first, so 2 plus 2 is 4. Then I just did the sum from left to right, so 4 plus 12 is 16, and 16 divided by 4 is 4.

Actually, looking at it again, 12 divided by 4 is 3, and then 4 plus 3 is 7. That sounds more like the BIDMAS rule thing. So I'll go with B.
