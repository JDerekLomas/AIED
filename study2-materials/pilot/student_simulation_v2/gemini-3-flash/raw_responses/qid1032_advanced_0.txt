This is a basic order of operations problem. According to BIDMAS, multiplication must be performed before addition. Therefore, you calculate $4 \times 3 = 12$ first, and then add the $5$ to get $17$. Doing the addition first would be a classic "left-to-right" error resulting in $27$, but that violates standard algebraic hierarchy.
