ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right because you have to do the times first anyway, so moving the 3 to the end doesn't change that you do $2 \times 1$ first.

But Tom is wrong because you aren't allowed to just swap the numbers around like that. If you have $3 + 2 - 1$, you have to go in order, so $3 + 2$ is $5$, then take away $1$ is $4$. If you do $3 - 1 + 2$ it's different because the minus is in the wrong place. Plus, I remember my teacher saying you can't just move subtractions around.
