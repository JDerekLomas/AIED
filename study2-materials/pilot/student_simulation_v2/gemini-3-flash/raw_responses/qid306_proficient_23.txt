ANSWER: B

For Problem P, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS, so you just work from left to right, meaning you do $4-5$ first. For Problem Q, you have to do the multiplication before the addition because 'M' comes before 'A', so you do $5 \times 6$ first. People sometimes get confused and think addition always comes before subtraction because of the order of the letters in BIDMAS, but my teacher always says they are equal and you just go left to right.
