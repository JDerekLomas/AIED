ANSWER: A

My thinking: To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, and 7), so you have to divide by 5. Adding the 0 doesn't change the sum at the top, so 1+3+4+7 is fine, but you still need to divide by 5 because the 0 counts as a value. B is wrong because you'd have to do the division before the adding.
