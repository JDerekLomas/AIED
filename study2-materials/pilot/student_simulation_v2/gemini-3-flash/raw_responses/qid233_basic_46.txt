ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the 'divide' sign, you usually write it as a fraction with the first number on top. For the bit in the brackets, $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you're meant to hide the times sign. So I looked for the one that has 2 on top and $ab+3$ on the bottom. Choice A looked okay but the fraction line didn't go under the whole thing, so it has to be C.
