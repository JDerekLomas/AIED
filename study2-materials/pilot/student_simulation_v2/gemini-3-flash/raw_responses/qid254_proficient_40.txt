ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, so $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is the same as $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$.

B is wrong because without brackets the division only applies to the 7, and C is a common mistake where people forget to count the zero as a data point.
