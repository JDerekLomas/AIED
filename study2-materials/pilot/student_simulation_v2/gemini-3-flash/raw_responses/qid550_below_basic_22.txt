ANSWER: D

Because for Tom's one, you have to do the plus first before the take away because of BIDMAS, and if you swap the numbers around the answer changes. And for Katie's one, the times is at the end but then it moves to the front, so that must be wrong too because you have to do the sums in the order they are written. None of them look right to me.
