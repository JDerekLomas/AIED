ANSWER: C

I think they are both right because in both questions you're just swapping the numbers around but the answer stays the same. 3 plus 2 minus 1 is 4, and 3 minus 1 plus 2 is also 4. Then for Katie's one, you do the times first because of BIDMAS, so 2 times 1 is 2, then add the 3 makes 5. If you swap it like she did, it's still 2 plus 3 which is 5. Since they both get the same answer, they are both correct.
