ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the 'divide' sign, you usually write it like a fraction with the first number on top. The $a \times b$ part just becomes $ab$ because you take the times sign out. So it's 2 on the top and $ab + 3$ on the bottom. D looks okay but my teacher said we aren't supposed to keep the $\times$ in the final answer.
