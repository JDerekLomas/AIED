ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the equation is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$. Then I multiply that by 3, and $3 \times 0.09$ gives $0.27$. (I almost chose D because I accidentally did $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then squared it, but then I remembered BIDMAS says indices come before multiplication).
