A) Only Jo

I think it's Jo because she put the big brackets around the whole middle bit before multiplying by 7 at the end. Paul's one looks wrong because the +4 is stuck on the end outside the brackets, so you'd only multiply the middle part by 7 and then add 4, but the question says adding 4 happens before the last bit. Jo's fraction thing is a bit confusing but it looks more like the right order.
