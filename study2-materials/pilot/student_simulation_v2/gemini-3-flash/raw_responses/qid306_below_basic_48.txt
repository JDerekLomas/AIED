ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just read the numbers from left to right like when you're reading a book. In Problem P, the 4 and 5 come first, and in Problem Q, the 4 and 5 are at the start as well. I know there's that BIDMAS thing but it's really confusing and adding 4 and 5 first just seems easier.
