ANSWER: C

Both of them are right because in the first one, 3+2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. And 3 minus 1 is 2, then add 2 is also 4, so it's the same. In Katie's one, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS, so 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 makes 5. It doesn't matter what side the 3 is on as long as you do the multiplying part first.
