ANSWER: C

**Explanation:**
In algebra, we write multiplication by putting terms next to each other (so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$) and division is written as a fraction. The brackets indicate that the entire expression $3 + ab$ is the denominator. While the order of terms in the denominator doesn't strictly matter ($3 + ab$ vs $ab + 3$), C is the only one that follows all conventions, including removing the multiplication sign which D fails to do.
