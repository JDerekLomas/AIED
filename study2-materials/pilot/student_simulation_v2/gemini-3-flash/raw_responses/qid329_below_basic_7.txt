B

I think it's B because when I do takeaways I always put the bigger number first so it's easier, and 0.2 is bigger than 0.1. Also, usually in maths you just do the sums from left to right, but Tom put brackets in and they always make things more complicated. Katie's looks like she just swapped them round to make it work better.
