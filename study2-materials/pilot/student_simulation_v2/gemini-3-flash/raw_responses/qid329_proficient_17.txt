ANSWER: A

My thinking: Tom is correct because of BIDMAS. We always have to do the division before the subtraction, so the expression is the same as if there were brackets around the $0.2 \div 0.3$. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the subtraction; $a - b$ isn't the same as $b - a$. It's a bit like $10 - 2 \div 2$, which is $9$, not $1 - 10$.
