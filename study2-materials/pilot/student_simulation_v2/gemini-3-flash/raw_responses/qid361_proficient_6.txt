I think it's Jo because the instructions say to add 4 and *then* finally multiply by 7. Jo's expression has the +4 inside the big brackets, so the whole thing gets multiplied by 7. Paul's expression only multiplies the first part by 7 and then adds the 4 at the end, which is a different order of operations.
