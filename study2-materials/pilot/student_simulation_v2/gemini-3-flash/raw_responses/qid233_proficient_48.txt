ANSWER: C

**My thinking:**
First, I looked at the part inside the brackets. In algebra, we don't use the '×' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. This gives us $(3 + ab)$. Then, the division sign $\div$ means the same as a fraction bar, with the 2 on top and the whole bracketed expression on the bottom. I chose C because it puts the $ab$ first ($ab + 3$ is the same as $3 + ab$) and follows the rule of hiding the multiplication sign, whereas D still has the '×' in it.
