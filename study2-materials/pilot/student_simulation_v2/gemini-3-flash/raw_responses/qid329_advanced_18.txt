**Explanation:**
According to the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. Tom’s statement correctly represents this by placing the brackets around the division part, showing it happens first. Katie’s statement is incorrect because she has changed the order of the terms, which changes the result (subtraction is not commutative).
