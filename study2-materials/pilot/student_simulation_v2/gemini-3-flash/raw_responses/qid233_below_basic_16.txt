ANSWER: A

I think it's A because in maths you usually have to do things in the order they come in the question. The 2 and the 3 are at the start and have a divide sign between them, so I picked the one that shows 2 over 3. Plus, $ab$ just looks like what we did in class where you push the letters together to get rid of the times sign.
