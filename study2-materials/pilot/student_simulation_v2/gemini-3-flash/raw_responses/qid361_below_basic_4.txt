I think it's Paul because his one has more brackets and that usually makes it right. Also, the last thing it says to do is "multiply by 7" and in Paul's one the 4 is at the end, so you just do the add 4 last. Jo's one has the 7 on the outside of everything which looks too complicated and I don't really get the fraction line thing.
