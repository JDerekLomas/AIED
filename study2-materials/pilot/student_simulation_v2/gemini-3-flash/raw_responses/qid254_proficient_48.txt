ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a piece of data, so you have to divide by 5. Adding the 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, so $(1+3+4+7)/5$ is the same as $(0+1+3+4+7)/5$. B is wrong because without brackets the division would only apply to the 7.
