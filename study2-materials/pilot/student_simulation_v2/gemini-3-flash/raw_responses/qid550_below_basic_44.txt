ANSWER: D

Because for Tom's one, the numbers are in a different order and you have to do the plus before the takeaway, so 3+2 is 5 then minus 1 is 4. But on the other side, 3 minus 1 is 2 then plus 2 is 4, but I think you have to do the plus first because of BIDMAS so it wouldn't be the same. And Katie's one looks wrong because the times is at the end on one side and in the middle on the other, and BIDMAS says you always do times first so it probably changes the answer. None of them look right to me.
