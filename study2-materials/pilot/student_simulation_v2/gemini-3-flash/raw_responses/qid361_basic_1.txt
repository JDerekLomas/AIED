A) Only Jo

I think Jo is right because she put the big brackets around the whole thing before multiplying by 7 at the end. Paul's one looks wrong because he put the +4 outside of the brackets, so you'd only multiply the middle bit by 7 and not the 4. My teacher says you have to do everything in the right order and Jo's fraction line means you do the subtract 5 first, which is what the question says.
