A) Only Jo

I think it's A because Jo has put the whole bit inside the big brackets. The question says you have to multiply by 7 at the very end, and Jo's way does that. Paul's one has the +4 outside the big brackets, so you'd only multiply the middle bit by 7 and then add 4, which is the wrong order. Jo's fraction thing is a bit confusing but it means divide, so it looks right.
