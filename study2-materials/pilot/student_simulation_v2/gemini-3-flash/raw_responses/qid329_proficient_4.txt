ANSWER: A

My thinking is that Tom is right because of the BIDMAS rule. You have to do the division before the subtraction, so $0.1 - 0.2 \div 0.3$ is the same as putting brackets around the division part like he did. Katie is wrong because subtraction isn't commutative; you can't just swap the $0.1$ and the result of the division around without changing the answer to a negative or positive.
