A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You start with $n$, then take away 5 which is $(n-5)$. Then you divide by 8, so Jo’s fraction looks right. Then you add 4. But because the very last thing you do is multiply everything by 7, you need the big brackets around the whole thing like Jo has. Paul put the $+ 4$ outside his brackets at the end, so I think he would only multiply the first bit by 7 and forget to multiply the 4.
