ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of how BIDMAS (or order of operations) works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work left to right. $3+2-1=4$ and $3-1+2=4$. For Katie, you have to do the multiplication first regardless of the order it's written in. So $3+(2 \times 1) = 5$ and $(2 \times 1)+3 = 5$. They are basically just showing that addition is commutative even when there are other bits involved.
