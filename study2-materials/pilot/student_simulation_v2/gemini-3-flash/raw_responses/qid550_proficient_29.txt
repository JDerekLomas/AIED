ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of how BIDMAS (or BODMAS) works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so they are equivalent. For Katie, even though the order is swapped, the multiplication ($2 \times 1$) is always done first regardless of whether it's at the start or the end of the expression, and then you add the $3$, so both sides equal $5$.
