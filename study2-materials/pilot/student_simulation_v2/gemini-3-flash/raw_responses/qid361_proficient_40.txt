ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations perfectly. By putting the $(n-5)/8 + 4$ inside the brackets, the multiplication by 7 applies to everything that came before, which is what the question asks for. Paul’s expression is wrong because he didn't put a second set of brackets around the $+4$, so in his version, you’d only multiply the first part by 7 and then add 4 at the very end.
