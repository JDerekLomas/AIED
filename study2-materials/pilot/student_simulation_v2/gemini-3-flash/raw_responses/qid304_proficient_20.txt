ANSWER: C

I used BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction). Since the 3-4 is inside the brackets, you have to do that part first before you can multiply the result by 2 or add the 1. Most people might try to do 1+2 first because it's at the start, but the brackets always come top of the list.
