ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has a divide sign in it and the question says to divide by 8. Jo's looks like a fraction and I don't really get how fractions work. Plus, Paul's one ends with +4 and the last thing it says in the question is to multiply by 7, but I think you're supposed to do the plus bit at the end of the line because that's just how you write it.
