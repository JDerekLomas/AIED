My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to follow BODMAS (or BIDMAS), so the multiplication ($5 \times 6$) definitely comes before the addition. For Problem P, since addition and subtraction have the same priority, you just work from left to right, so you'd do $4 - 5$ first. I know some people think 'A' for Addition comes before 'S' for Subtraction in the acronym, but my teacher said you just go across the line.
