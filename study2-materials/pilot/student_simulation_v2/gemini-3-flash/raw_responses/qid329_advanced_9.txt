A

**Explanation:**
According to the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules for the order of operations, division must be performed before subtraction. Therefore, the expression $0.1 - 0.2 \div 0.3$ is evaluated by first dividing $0.2$ by $0.3$ and then subtracting that result from $0.1$. Tom’s use of brackets correctly identifies this priority. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$.
