My thinking is that both of them are correct because they are just changing the order of the terms while keeping the signs the same. For Tom, $3+2-1$ is $4$, and $3-1+2$ is also $4$. For Katie, BIDMAS means you do the multiplication first either way ($2 \times 1 = 2$), so $3+2$ and $2+3$ both equal $5$. It's basically just the commutative property.
