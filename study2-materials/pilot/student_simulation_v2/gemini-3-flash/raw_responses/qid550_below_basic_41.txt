ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in the wrong order. My teacher says you have to do the sums in the order they are written, so if you move the numbers around like Tom and Katie did, it changes the answer. Plus, Katie's one has a times sign and you have to do BIDMAS, which is really confusing, so they are probably both wrong.
