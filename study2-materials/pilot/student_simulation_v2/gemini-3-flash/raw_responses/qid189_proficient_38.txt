A) -44

**Thinking:** To find the 15th term, I just need to substitute $n=15$ into the formula. So, $u_{15} = 1 - 3(15)$. $3 \times 15$ is $45$, and then $1 - 45$ gives $-44$. I double-checked the subtraction because it's easy to accidentally do $45 - 1$ and get $44$, but since it's $1$ take away $45$, it has to be negative.
