ANSWER: B

My thinking: I just needed to substitute $x = 0.3$ into the equation $y = 3x^2$. First, I did $0.3^2$, which is $0.09$. Then I multiplied that by 3 to get $0.27$. It’s easy to accidentally do $3 \times 0.3$ first and then square it, which would give $0.81$, but I remembered that BIDMAS means you have to do the power before the multiplication.
