ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, and 7). I didn't think I needed to put the 0 on the top of the fraction because it doesn't add anything to the total, but I still have to divide by 5 because the 0 is one of the numbers. B is wrong because you have to do the adding first before the divide.
