My thinking: Both of them are correct because they are just rearranging the terms while keeping the correct signs. For Tom, $3 + 2 - 1$ is $4$, and $3 - 1 + 2$ is also $4$. Addition and subtraction have the same priority, so as long as you keep the minus with the $1$, the order doesn't change the result. 

For Katie, it's the same thing with the order of operations (BIDMAS). You have to do the $2 \times 1$ first in both versions, then add the $3$, so both sides equal $5$. They are just using the commutative property.
