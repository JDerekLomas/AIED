ANSWER: C

**My thinking:**
First, I know that in algebra we don't use the multiplication sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Then, since the $3 + ab$ is all inside the brackets, it means the 2 is being divided by that entire expression. In algebra, we show division using a fraction bar, so the $3 + ab$ goes on the bottom. C and D look similar, but C is better because it follows the rule of getting rid of the $\times$ sign. I did double-check if the order of $3$ and $ab$ mattered, but adding is the same both ways!
