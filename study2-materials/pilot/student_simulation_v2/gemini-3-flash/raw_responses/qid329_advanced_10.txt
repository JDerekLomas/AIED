**Explanation:**
According to the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules, division must be performed before subtraction. Tom is correct because his use of brackets explicitly shows the division happening first, which matches the standard order of operations. Katie is incorrect because she has swapped the order of the subtraction terms; $a - b$ is not equivalent to $b - a$ unless both terms are equal.
