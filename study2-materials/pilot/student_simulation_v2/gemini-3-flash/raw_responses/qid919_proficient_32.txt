ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the equation is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first and then multiply by 3. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$, and then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. You have to be careful not to do $3 \times 0.3$ first and then square it, because that would give $0.81$ which is option A.
