**Explanation:**
Both Tom and Katie are correct because addition and subtraction have the same priority (left-to-right), and addition is commutative. Tom’s statement holds because $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$; he is essentially rearranging $3+2+(-1)$. Katie’s statement is also correct because of the commutative property of addition; even though the multiplication must be done first according to BIDMAS, $3+2 = 2+3$, so $3+(2 \times 1)$ is the same as $(2 \times 1)+3$.
