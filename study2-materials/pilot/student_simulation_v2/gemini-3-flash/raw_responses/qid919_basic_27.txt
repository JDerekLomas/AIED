ANSWER: B

So, I need to put 0.3 where the $x$ is. I did 3 times 0.3 which is 0.9, and then I have to square it. 9 times 9 is 81, so I thought it might be A, but then I remembered the 3 is at the front. If I do 0.3 squared first, that's $0.3 \times 0.3$ which is 0.09, and then $3 \times 9$ is 27, so it must be 0.27.
