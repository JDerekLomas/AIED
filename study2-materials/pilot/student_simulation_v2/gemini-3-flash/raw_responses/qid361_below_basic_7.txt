ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign ($\div$) in it and the question says divide. Jo's one just has a line like a fraction and I don't really like fractions, they're confusing. Paul also put the $+ 4$ at the end and the question says you add 4 near the end, so that looks more right to me.
