ANSWER: D

I'm not really sure how to do the $n$ bit, but I saw the number 15 and the number 3 in the question. 15 times 3 is 45, but that's not an answer. Then I saw 30, and 15 plus 15 is 30. It looks like a normal number and I don't like the minus signs, but D just looked like the right sort of answer.
