My thinking is that both of them are right because of how the order of operations (BIDMAS) works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so those are the same. For Katie, even though she's swapped the order, you always do the multiplication first anyway. $3 + (2 \times 1) = 5$ and $(2 \times 1) + 3 = 5$, so that works too. They are both just using the commutative property, really.
