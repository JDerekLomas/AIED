ANSWER: C

Both are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition.

In Tom’s case, the expression is essentially $3 + 2 + (-1)$. Since addition is commutative, the terms can be reordered as $3 + (-1) + 2$ without changing the result (both equal 4).

In Katie’s case, she is treating the multiplication $2 \times 1$ as a single term due to BIDMAS/order of operations. She has correctly swapped the order of the two terms being added ($3$ and the product of $2 \times 1$), which maintains equality (both equal 5).
