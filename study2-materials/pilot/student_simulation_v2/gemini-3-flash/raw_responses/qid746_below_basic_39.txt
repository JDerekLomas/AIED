ANSWER: B

I think it's B because 4 plus 12 is 16, and then you divide it by 2 which is 8, and then take away 1 or something? Wait, I just did 4 + 12 = 16 and then divided by 2 is 8, and B is the closest one to that. Plus, 12 divided by 2 is 6 and 6 plus 1 is 7, and those numbers are all in the question.
