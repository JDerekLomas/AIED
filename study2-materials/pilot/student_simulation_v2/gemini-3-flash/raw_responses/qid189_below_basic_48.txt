ANSWER: C

I think it's C because the question has the number 15 in it and -14 is the closest number to that. I tried to do 1 minus 15 which is 14, and then I just put the minus sign on it because the other answers had minuses too. 3n looks like 13 or something so I just ignored that bit because it was confusing.
