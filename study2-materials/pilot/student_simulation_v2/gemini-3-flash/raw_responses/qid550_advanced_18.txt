ANSWER: C

Both are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition. 

Tom's statement holds because subtraction can be treated as adding a negative number ($3 + 2 + (-1)$), so the order of the terms doesn't matter. Katie's statement is also correct because multiplication takes priority in the order of operations (BIDMAS); in both cases, you perform $2 \times 1$ first and then add 3, so the expressions are equivalent.
