A

**Explanation:**
According to the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules, division must be performed before subtraction. Tom is correct because his use of brackets explicitly shows the division happening first, which matches the standard order of operations. Katie is incorrect because the order of subtraction matters; \( a - b \) is not equivalent to \( b - a \). Since \( 0.2 \div 0.3 \) is approximately \( 0.67 \), the expression \( 0.1 - 0.67 \) results in a negative value, whereas Katie's version would be positive.
