B

My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to follow BIDMAS, so multiplication comes before addition, meaning you do $5 \times 6$ first. For Problem P, since addition and subtraction have the same priority, you just work from left to right, so you do $4 - 5$ first. I sometimes get confused and think addition always comes before subtraction because the 'A' is before the 'S' in BIDMAS, but my teacher said you just go in order for those two.
