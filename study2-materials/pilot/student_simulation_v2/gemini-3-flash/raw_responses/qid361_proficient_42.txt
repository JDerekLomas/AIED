ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because she used brackets to show that the entire result of the division and addition is multiplied by 7. Paul's version only multiplies the division part by 7 and then adds 4 at the very end, which doesn't follow the "finally multiply by 7" instruction. I almost picked C because Paul used brackets for the subtraction, but the +4 has to be inside the big brackets for the multiplication to work on everything.
