ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the equation is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first and then multiply by 3. $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$, and then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. It's easy to accidentally do $3 \times 0.3$ first and then square it (which would give $0.81$), but BIDMAS says I have to do the power/indices before the multiplication.
