ANSWER: C

My thinking is that when you write maths in algebra, you don't use the divide sign, you use a fraction line instead. So the 2 goes on the top and everything else goes on the bottom. You also don't need the times sign between $a$ and $b$, you just squash them together to make $ab$. I thought it might be A at first because of the 2 over 3, but the $ab$ has to stay with the 3 because it's all inside the brackets.
