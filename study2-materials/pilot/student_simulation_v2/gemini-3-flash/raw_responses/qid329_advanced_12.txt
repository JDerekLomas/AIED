A

**Explanation:**
According to BIDMAS/BODMAS rules, division must be performed before subtraction. Therefore, the expression $0.1 - 0.2 \div 0.3$ is evaluated by first dividing $0.2$ by $0.3$ and then subtracting that result from $0.1$. Tom’s use of brackets correctly identifies this order. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not equivalent to $b - a$.
