ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). Multiplication happens before addition, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. The expression inside the bracket is therefore $ab + 3$. The division $2 \div (ab + 3)$ is written as a fraction, $\frac{2}{ab+3}$. Choice D is incorrect because we remove the multiplication symbol ($\times$) in standard algebraic convention.
