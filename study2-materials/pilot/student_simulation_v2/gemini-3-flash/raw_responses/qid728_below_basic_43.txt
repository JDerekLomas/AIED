ANSWER: D

I think it's D because when you add up the numbers 16, 6 and 4 it makes a big number, and then when you divide by 2 it makes it smaller. 16 minus 6 is 10, then add 4 is 14, and half of 14 is 7. The other ones have the brackets in weird places and I usually just try to do the sum from left to right.
