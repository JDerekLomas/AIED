ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, and then I did the brackets 2 + 2 which is 4. Then I just had to do 16 divided by 4, which is 4. But wait, my teacher said something about BIDMAS and doing the division or the brackets first. If I do 12 divided by 4 that's 3, and then 4 + 3 is 7. That's one of the answers so it's probably that one.
