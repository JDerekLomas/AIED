ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you aren't allowed to just swap the numbers around like that. My teacher said you always have to do it in the right order (BIDMAS), so if you move the minus or the times sign to a different place in the sum, it changes the whole thing and makes it a different answer. Plus, Tom's one looks like it would be a bigger number because you're adding the 2 at the end instead of taking away.
