ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the data set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Option A is correct because adding 0 doesn't change the top sum, but you still have to divide by 5. Option B is wrong because of BIDMAS (it would only divide the 7 by 5), and C is wrong because it forgets to count the zero as a piece of data.
