ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of how BIDMAS (or BODMAS) works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so they are equivalent. For Katie, the multiplication has to be done first anyway ($2 \times 1 = 2$), so both sides of her equation simplify to $3+2 = 5$. Since the order you add the numbers doesn't change the result, she's right too.
