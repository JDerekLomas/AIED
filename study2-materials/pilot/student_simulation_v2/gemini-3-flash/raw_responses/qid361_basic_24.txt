A) Only Jo

I think it's Jo because she put the bracket around the whole middle bit before multiplying by 7. In the question, it says "finally multiply by 7," which means everything you've done before has to be timesed by 7. Paul's one looks like you only multiply the first bit by 7 and then add the 4 at the very end, which is wrong because the adding 4 happened before the multiplying.
