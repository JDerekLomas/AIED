ANSWER: C

Algebraic convention dictates that we remove the multiplication symbol between variables (so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$) and use a fraction bar instead of the division symbol. The entire expression inside the brackets, $(3 + ab)$, becomes the denominator of the fraction. Therefore, the expression is written as $\frac{2}{3+ab}$, which is the same as option C.
