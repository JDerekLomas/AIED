I chose Katie because in the first one you've got a minus and then a divide, but you're supposed to do things in order. Katie's one looks better because it has the 0.2 and 0.3 at the start and the numbers are just switched around, which usually makes it easier to take away. Tom just put brackets in and they always make it more confusing.
