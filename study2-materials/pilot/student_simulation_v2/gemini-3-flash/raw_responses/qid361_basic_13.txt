A) Only Jo

My thinking: Jo’s one looks right because it has the big brackets around everything before you multiply by 7. You have to do the +4 part before you times by 7 at the end, and Jo put the 4 inside the brackets. Paul put the 4 at the end outside the brackets, so you’d only be multiplying the divide bit by 7 and not the 4. Also, putting the divide part in a fraction like Jo did is how my teacher shows it.
