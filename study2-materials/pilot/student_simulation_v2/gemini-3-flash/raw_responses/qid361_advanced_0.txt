ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression correctly follows the order of operations described. By placing the "add 4" step inside the parentheses with the rest of the expression, the "multiply by 7" applies to the entire result. Paul’s expression is incorrect because, according to BIDMAS/BODMAS, the multiplication by 7 would only apply to the division part, and the 4 would be added at the very end, failing to multiply the final sum by 7.
