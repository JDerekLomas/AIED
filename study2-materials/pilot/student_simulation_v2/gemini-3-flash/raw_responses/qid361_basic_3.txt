A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You start with $n$, then minus 5, which is $n-5$. Then you divide that by 8, which Jo wrote as a fraction. Then you add 4 to that whole bit. Finally, you multiply everything by 7, and Jo put the 7 outside the big brackets so it times everything inside. Paul is wrong because his 4 is outside the brackets, so you wouldn't multiply it by 7 at the end.
