ANSWER: D

I looked at the options and did a bit of mental maths for each. For D, you do the brackets first which is $16 - 6 = 10$, then add the $4$ to get $14$. Then you just divide the whole thing by $2$ at the end, which gives $7$. A looked a bit tempting but that would be $16 - 5$, which is $11$.
