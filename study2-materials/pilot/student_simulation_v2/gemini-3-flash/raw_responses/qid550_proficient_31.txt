My thinking is that both of them are correct because they're just swapping the order of the terms but keeping the signs attached to the numbers. 

For Tom, $3+2-1$ is $4$, and $3-1+2$ is also $4$. As long as you keep the minus with the $1$, the order of addition and subtraction doesn't matter. 

For Katie, it's the same thing with BIDMAS. You do the multiplication first in both cases ($2 \times 1 = 2$), so you just end up with $3+2$ or $2+3$, which both equal $5$. They're basically just showing that addition is commutative even when there are other operations involved.
