ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the brackets first, which is $2 + 2 = 4$. Then you do the division, so $12 \div 4 = 3$. Finally, you add the $4$ at the start, and $4 + 3 = 7$. 

(I almost just did $4 + 12$ first because it's at the beginning, which would have given me $16 \div 4 = 4$, but I remembered the order of operations!)
