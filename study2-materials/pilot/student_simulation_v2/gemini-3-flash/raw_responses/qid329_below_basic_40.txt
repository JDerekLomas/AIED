B

I think it's B because Katie just swapped the numbers around and usually in maths you can do that, like how 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2. Tom's one has brackets and brackets always make things more complicated and confusing, so I don't think his can be right. Plus, Katie's looks like it flows better.
