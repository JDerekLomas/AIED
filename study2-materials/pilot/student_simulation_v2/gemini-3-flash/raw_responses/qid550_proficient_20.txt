ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of how BIDMAS (or order of operations) works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work left to right. $3+2-1=4$ and $3-1+2=4$. For Katie, you have to do the multiplication first regardless of the order it's written in. $2 \times 1$ is 2, and then adding 3 gives 5 on both sides. They are just swapping the terms around, which is fine as long as you keep the signs with the numbers.
