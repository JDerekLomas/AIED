ANSWER: A

I know to find the mean you have to add all the numbers up and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, but one of them is 0, so I thought maybe I should divide by 4 because 0 doesn't really count as a value. But then I remembered my teacher saying you still have to count the 0 as a piece of data, so it has to be divided by 5. B looks wrong because you'd only be dividing the 7 by 5, not the whole lot. A has the 5 on the bottom, and even though the 0 isn't written in the sum, adding 0 doesn't change the top number anyway.
