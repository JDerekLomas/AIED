B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign and the question says divide by 8, so that makes more sense. Jo's one has a fraction and I don't really like fractions, they're confusing. Also, Paul's one ends with +4 and then there's a 7, and the question says add 4 and then multiply by 7, so it looks like it's in the right order.
