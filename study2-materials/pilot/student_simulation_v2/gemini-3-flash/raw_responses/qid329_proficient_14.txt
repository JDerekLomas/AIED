ANSWER: A

My thinking is that BIDMAS (or BODMAS) says you have to do division before subtraction. Tom has put brackets around the division part, which doesn't change the value because you'd do that bit first anyway. Katie has swapped the order of the numbers around the subtraction sign, and $0.1 - \text{something}$ isn't the same as $\text{that something} - 0.1$, so she's wrong.
