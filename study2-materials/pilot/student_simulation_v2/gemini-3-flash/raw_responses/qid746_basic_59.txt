ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, then I did the bit in the brackets which is 2 plus 2 is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4 which is 4. But wait, my teacher said something about BIDMAS and doing the divide before the plus, so if I do 12 divided by 4 that's 3, and then 4 plus 3 is 7. I'll go with 7.
