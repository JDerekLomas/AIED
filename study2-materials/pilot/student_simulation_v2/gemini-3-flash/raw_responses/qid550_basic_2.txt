ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one makes sense because you have to do the 2 times 1 first because of BIDMAS, and it doesn't matter if it's at the start or the end. But for Tom, I think he's wrong because you have to do the plus before the minus, so for the first one you do 3 + 2 which is 5, then take away 1 to get 4. In his second one, you do the 1 + 2 first which is 3, then 3 take away 3 is 0, so they aren't the same.
