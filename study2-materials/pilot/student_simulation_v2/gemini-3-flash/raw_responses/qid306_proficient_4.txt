B

My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to follow BIDMAS, so multiplication definitely comes before addition, meaning you do $5 \times 6$ first. For Problem P, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. Even though some people think the 'A' for addition comes before 'S' for subtraction in the acronym, my teacher says you just go across the line, so $4-5$ is first.
