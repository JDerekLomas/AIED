ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of how BIDMAS works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so they are equivalent. For Katie, you have to do the multiplication first anyway. $3+(2 \times 1)$ is 5, and $(2 \times 1)+3$ is also 5. They’ve basically just swapped the terms around, which is fine for addition.
