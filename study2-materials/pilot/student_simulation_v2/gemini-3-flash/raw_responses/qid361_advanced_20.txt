**Explanation:**
Jo’s expression correctly follows the order of operations described. By putting the $(n-5)/8 + 4$ inside the brackets, she ensures the entire result is multiplied by $7$ at the end. Paul’s expression is incorrect because, according to BIDMAS/BODMAS, multiplication happens before addition. In his version, only the division part is multiplied by $7$, and the $4$ is added at the very end, which misses the final instruction to multiply the whole result by $7$.
