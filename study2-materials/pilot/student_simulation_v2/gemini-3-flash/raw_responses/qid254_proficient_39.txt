ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you add all the numbers up and divide by how many numbers there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, you still have to count it as one of the values in the set, so you divide by 5. Since adding 0 doesn't change the total, the top of the fraction is just 1+3+4+7. I almost picked B, but without brackets, the division would only apply to the 7 because of BIDMAS.
