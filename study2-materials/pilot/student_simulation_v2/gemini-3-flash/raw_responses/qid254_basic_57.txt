ANSWER: A

My teacher said the mean is when you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I have to divide by 5. I didn't include the 0 in the top part because adding 0 doesn't change the sum, but I still counted it as one of the 5 numbers. B looks wrong because you'd only divide the 7 by 5 if you typed it into a calculator like that.
