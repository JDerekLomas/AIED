ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a piece of data, so you have to divide the sum by 5. Since adding 0 doesn't change the total, the top of the fraction is just $1+3+4+7$, and the bottom is 5. Option B is wrong because of BIDMAS (it would divide the 7 by 5 first), and C is wrong because it only divides by 4.
