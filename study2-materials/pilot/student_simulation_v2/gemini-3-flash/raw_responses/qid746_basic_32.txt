ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, then I did the bit in the brackets which is 4. So it’s 16 divided by 4 which is 4, but that’s D. Wait, my teacher said something about doing the divide first? If I do 12 divided by 2 it's 6, then plus the other 2 is 8, plus 4 is 12? No, I'll just do it in order. 4 + 12 = 16. Then 2 + 2 = 4. 16 divided by 4 is 4. 

Actually, I remember BIDMAS now. Brackets first! 2 + 2 = 4. Then you do the divide, so 12 divided by 4 is 3. Then I just have to add the 4 at the start
