ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just read it from left to right like a sentence. For P, the 4 and 5 come first, and for Q, the 4 and 5 are also at the start so you have to add them before you can do the times bit. Plus, I remember my teacher saying something about adding before subtracting in BIDMAS, but that's too confusing so I just do the first numbers I see.
