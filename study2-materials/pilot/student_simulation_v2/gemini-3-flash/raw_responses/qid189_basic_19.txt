ANSWER: C

I thought because the question asks for the 15th term, I should do $1 - 3$ first, which is $-2$. Then I just multiplied that by $15$, so $-2 \times 15$ is $-30$. But that wasn't an option that felt right, so I looked at the numbers and thought maybe I just do $15 - 1$ which is $14$ and make it minus because the $3n$ part is negative.
