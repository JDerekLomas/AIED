ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to square the $x$ value first because of BIDMAS. So, $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$. Then I just multiply that by 3, and $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. You have to be careful not to do $3 \times 0.3$ first, otherwise you'd get $0.9^2$ which is $0.81$, but the squared is only on the $x$.
