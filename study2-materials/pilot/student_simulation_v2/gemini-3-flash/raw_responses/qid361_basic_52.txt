A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in order. You do the minus 5 first (n-5), then the divide 8, and then add the 4. Jo has the +4 inside the big brackets, so it gets multiplied by 7 at the very end like the question says. Paul put the +4 outside at the end, which means it doesn't get multiplied by the 7, so that doesn't seem right.
