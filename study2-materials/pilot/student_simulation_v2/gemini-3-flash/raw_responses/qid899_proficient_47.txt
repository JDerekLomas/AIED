ANSWER: C

I used BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction). Since there aren't any brackets or indices, you have to do the multiplication ($8 \times 7$) before you do the subtraction or addition. It’s easy to just want to go from left to right, but the rule says multiplication comes first.
