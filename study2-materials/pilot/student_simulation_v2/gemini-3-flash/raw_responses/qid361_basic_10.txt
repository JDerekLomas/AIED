ANSWER: A

I think Jo is right because the brackets go around everything before you multiply by the 7 at the end. Paul's one looks wrong because the +4 is outside the big brackets, so you would only multiply the first bit by 7 and then add the 4 last, but the question says to add 4 and *then* multiply. I usually get mixed up with where the brackets go, but Jo's looks more like the way my teacher writes it.
