ANSWER: A

My thinking is that BIDMAS (or BODMAS) rules say we have to do the division before the subtraction. Since Tom's version puts brackets around the division, it doesn't actually change the order of the calculation, it just makes it clearer—so his statement is correct. Katie has swapped the order of the terms around the minus sign, which you can't do because subtraction isn't commutative ($0.1 - 0.6$ is not the same as $0.6 - 0.1$). Therefore, only Tom is right.
