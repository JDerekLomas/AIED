ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right. You always have to do the times part first because of BODMAS, and she kept the 2x1 together. 

But I think Tom is wrong because he moved the numbers around. If you do 3+2 you get 5, then take away 1 is 4. But on the other side, he changed the order to 3-1 which is 2, then plus 2 is 4... wait, that's the same, but my teacher said you always have to do the plus before the minus because A comes before S in BIDMAS, so you can't just swap them like that. Since he changed the order, it must be wrong.
