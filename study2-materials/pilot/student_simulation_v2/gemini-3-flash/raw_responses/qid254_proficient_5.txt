ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though the first number is a 0, you still have to count it as one of the values, so there are 5 numbers in total. You don't really need to write the "+ 0" on the top because it doesn't change the sum, so A is the correct way to show the calculation. B is wrong because without brackets the division would only apply to the 7.
