A) Only Tom

**My thinking:**
BIDMAS (or BODMAS) says we have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's statement shows exactly that by putting the brackets around the division part, so he's correct. Katie has swapped the order of the terms around, and because subtraction isn't commutative ($a - b$ isn't the same as $b - a$), her version would give a different, positive answer. It's a bit of a weird-looking question with the decimals, but the rule for the order stays the same.
