ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the division ($18 \div 2 = 9$) and the multiplication ($2 \times 2 = 4$) before you do the adding in the middle. So, $9 + 4 = 13$. If you just went from left to right, you'd get a different answer, but my teacher always says to follow the order of operations!
