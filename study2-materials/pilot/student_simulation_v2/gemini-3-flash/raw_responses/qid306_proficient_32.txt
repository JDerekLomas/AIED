ANSWER: B

For Problem P, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS, so you just work from left to right, which means doing $4-5$ first. For Problem Q, you have to do the multiplication ($5 \times 6$) before the addition because 'M' comes before 'A' in the order of operations. B matches both of those.
