A) Only Tom

My thinking: In the order of operations (BIDMAS), you always have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's equation is correct because putting brackets around the $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ doesn't change anything—it just shows that the division happens first anyway. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the terms around the minus sign, and $0.1 - \text{something}$ isn't the same as $\text{something} - 0.1$.
