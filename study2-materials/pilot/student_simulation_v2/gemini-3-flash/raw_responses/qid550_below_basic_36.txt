ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order on the other side of the equals sign. My teacher says you have to do things in a specific order (BIDMAS), so if you move the numbers around it changes the sum and makes it wrong. Tom moved the 1 and the 2, and Katie swapped the 3 and the 2, so they both look like they've broken the rules.
