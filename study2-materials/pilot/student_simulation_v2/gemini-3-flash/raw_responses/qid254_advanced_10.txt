A

**Explanation:** To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one of the values is 0, it still counts as an entry in the data set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding 0 doesn't change the numerator ($1+3+4+7 = 15$), but you must divide by 5. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5.
