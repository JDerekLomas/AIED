ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the division and the multiplication first before you do the addition. So, $18 \div 2 = 9$ and $2 \times 2 = 4$. Then you just add them together ($9 + 4$) to get 13. I almost did the addition in the middle first by accident, which would have given me 3, but I remembered the order of operations!
