A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in order. You do the minus 5 first (n-5), then the divide 8, and then add 4. Jo's one has a big bracket with the +4 inside it, and the 7 is on the outside, so you multiply everything by 7 at the very end like the question says. Paul's one has the +4 at the end outside the brackets, so I think you'd only multiply the middle bit by 7 and forget the 4.
