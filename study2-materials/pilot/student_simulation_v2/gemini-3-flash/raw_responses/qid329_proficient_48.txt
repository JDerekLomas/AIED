A) Only Tom

My thinking: In BIDMAS, division always comes before subtraction. Tom has just put brackets around the division part, which doesn't change the calculation—it just makes the order of operations more obvious. Katie has swapped the order of the numbers around the minus sign; subtraction isn't commutative, so $0.1 - (0.2 \div 0.3)$ is definitely not the same as $(0.2 \div 0.3) - 0.1$. One would be negative and the other positive.
