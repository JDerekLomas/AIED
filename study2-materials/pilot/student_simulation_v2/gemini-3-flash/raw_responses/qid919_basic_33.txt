ANSWER: B

So, the equation is $y = 3x^2$, and $x$ is $0.3$. I did $3 \times 0.3$ first which is $0.9$, and then I had to square it. $9 \times 9$ is $81$, so $0.9 \times 0.9$ must be $0.81$, but that's not right because I forgot the 3 is at the front. 

Wait, $0.3$ squared is $0.09$, and then $3 \times 9$ is $27$, so it must be $0.27$.
