ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one is definitely right since 3 plus 2 is 5, and then times 1 is 5, and on the other side 2 times 1 is 2, plus 3 is 5. But Tom is wrong because if you do 3-1 you get 2, and then plus 2 is 4, but the first part is 3+2 which is 5, then take away 1 is 4... wait, actually they both look like 4. But my teacher said you always have to do the plus before the minus because of BIDMAS (Addition comes before Subtraction), so Tom must have the order wrong. Katie's just looks more like a proper rule.
