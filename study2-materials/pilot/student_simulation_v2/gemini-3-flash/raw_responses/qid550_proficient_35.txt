ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of how BIDMAS (or BODMAS) works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so as long as you keep the minus sign with the 1, you can swap the order and still get 4. For Katie, multiplication comes before addition, so in both her expressions you'd do the $2 \times 1$ first and then add the 3, which gives 5 both times. It's basically just the commutative property.
