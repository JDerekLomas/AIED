ANSWER: A

I know to find the mean you have to add all the numbers up and then divide by how many there are. There are five numbers in the list, but one is a zero, and adding zero doesn't change the total, so you just do 1+3+4+7. Then you have to divide by 5 because you still count the zero as a number. C is wrong because it only divides by 4, and B is wrong because you have to do the adding first before the dividing.
