ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we should use a fraction bar for division and remove the multiplication signs between letters. Inside the brackets, $a \times b$ becomes $ab$, so the whole denominator is $ab + 3$. Choice A is wrong because the division bar has to go over the entire expression that was in the brackets, and D still has the multiplication sign which we usually leave out.
