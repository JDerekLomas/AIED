ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the equation is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first and then multiply by 3. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$, and then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. I almost went for D because $3 \times 3$ is 9 and $9 \times 0.3$ is $2.7$, but I remembered you have to do the power before the multiplication.
