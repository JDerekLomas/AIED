ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to square the $x$ value first because of BIDMAS. So, $0.3^2$ is $0.09$ (since $3 \times 3 = 9$ and I need two decimal places). Then I just multiply that by 3, and $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. At first I almost went for D because $3 \times 0.3$ is $0.9$ and then squaring that gives $0.81$, but the squared is only on the $x$.
