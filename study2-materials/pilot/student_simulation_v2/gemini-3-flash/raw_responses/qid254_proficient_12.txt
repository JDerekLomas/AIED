ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, you still have to count it as one of the values, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, so it's just 1+3+4+7, but you definitely have to divide by 5. B is wrong because of BIDMAS (it would only divide the 7 by 5), and C is a classic mistake where people forget to count the zero.
