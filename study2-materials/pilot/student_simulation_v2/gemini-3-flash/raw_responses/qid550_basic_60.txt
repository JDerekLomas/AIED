ANSWER: C

I think they are both right because in the first one, it doesn't matter if you do the take away or the plus first, you still get the same answer. 3 plus 2 is 5, then take 1 is 4. And 3 take 1 is 2, then plus 2 is 4. Katie is right too because you have to do the times first anyway because of BIDMAS, and 2 times 1 is just 2, so it's just 3 plus 2 or 2 plus 3 which is 5.
