My thinking: According to BIDMAS, you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's version uses brackets to show exactly that, so his statement is definitely true. Katie’s version changes the order of the terms entirely; $0.1$ minus something isn't the same as that thing minus $0.1$, so she's wrong.
