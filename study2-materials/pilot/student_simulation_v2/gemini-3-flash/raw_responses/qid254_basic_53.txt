ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I have to divide by 5. The 0 doesn't change the sum when you add it, so you only need to add the other ones on top, but you still have to count the 0 as a number. B looks wrong because you'd only divide the 7 by 5, not the whole thing.
