ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are five numbers in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, and 7), so you have to divide by 5. B looks wrong because you only divide the 7 by 5, and C is wrong because it divides by 4. Even though the 0 doesn't add anything to the total, you still have to count it as one of the five numbers.
