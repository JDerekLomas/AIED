ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, then I divided that by the 2 plus 2 in the brackets which is 4. So 16 divided by 4 is 4, but that didn't feel right because of the order things go in. So I tried 12 divided by 2 which is 6, then added the 4 at the start to get 10, then added the last 2 to get 12. But my teacher said you have to do the brackets first, so I did 2+2=4, then 12 divided by 4 is 3, then 4+3 is 7.
