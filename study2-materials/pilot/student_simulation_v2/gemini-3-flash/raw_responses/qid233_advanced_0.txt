ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). We multiply $a$ and $b$ first, writing it as $ab$ without the multiplication sign. This product is then added to 3, forming the denominator $ab + 3$. The division is written as a fraction, putting the 2 on top, which gives $\frac{2}{ab+3}$.
