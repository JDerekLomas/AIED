A) Only Jo

I think it's Jo because the question says the very last thing you do is multiply by 7. In Jo’s one, the 7 is outside the big brackets which means it multiplies everything inside, including the +4. Paul’s one has the +4 at the end outside the brackets, so you’d only be multiplying the first bit by 7 and then adding 4 last, which is the wrong order.
