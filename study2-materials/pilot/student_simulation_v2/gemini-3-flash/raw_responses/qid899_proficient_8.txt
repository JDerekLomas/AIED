ANSWER: C

My thinking: We have to use BIDMAS (or BODMAS) for this. Multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so you have to do the $8 \times 7$ part first before doing the rest of the calculation from left to right. If you just went from left to right without thinking, you'd get it wrong.
