**Explanation:** Tom is right because of BIDMAS/BODMAS. You have to do the division ($0.2 \div 0.3$) before the subtraction, so the brackets don't actually change the calculation; they just show what part happens first. Katie is wrong because subtraction isn't commutative—you can't just swap the order of the numbers around the minus sign and get the same result.
