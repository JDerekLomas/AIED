ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school and it says you have to do the divide part before the take away part. Tom has put brackets around the divide bit which means you do that first, so that’s the same thing. Katie has swapped the numbers around and you can't really do that with take away because you'd get a different answer.
