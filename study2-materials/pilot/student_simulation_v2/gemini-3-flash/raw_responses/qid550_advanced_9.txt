Both Tom and Katie are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition.

In Tom’s case, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS/order of operations, so they are processed left-to-right. Effectively, he is treating the expression as $3 + 2 + (-1)$, and since addition is commutative, the order of the terms can be swapped ($3 - 1 + 2$ still equals 4).

In Katie’s case, multiplication must be performed before addition. In both versions of her identity, the $2 \times 1$ is evaluated first to get 2, leaving the calculation as $3 + 2$ or $2 + 3$, both of which equal 5.
