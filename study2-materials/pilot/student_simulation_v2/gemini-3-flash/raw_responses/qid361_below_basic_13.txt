ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the actual question. Jo's one has that big line like a fraction and fractions are always really hard, plus Paul used the divide sign $\div$ which is what the question says to do. I also thought maybe it's B because the 4 is at the end of the sum and the question says to add 4 and then multiply, so you just do them in that order. Jo put the 4 inside the brackets and that looks too complicated.
