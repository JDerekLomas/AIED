B

I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the actual steps. You do the take away 5, then the divide 8, and then the add 4 at the end. Jo's one has a fraction and the 4 is inside the big brackets with the 7, which looks too complicated. The question says add 4 and *then* multiply by 7, and Paul's has the +4 right at the end which makes more sense to me.
