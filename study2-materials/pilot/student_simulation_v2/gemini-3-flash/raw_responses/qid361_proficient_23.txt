ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations perfectly. You subtract 5 first $(n-5)$, then divide the whole thing by 8, then add 4 to that result, and finally multiply the entire expression by 7 using the outer brackets.

Paul is wrong because his expression doesn't multiply the $+4$ by the 7 at the end. In his version, the multiplication by 7 only applies to the division part, and the 4 is just added on at the very end.
