ANSWER: B

My thinking is that Katie is right because she's swapped the numbers around but kept the times together, and you always do times first because of BIDMAS. But Tom is wrong because you have to do the plus before the minus in BIDMAS (Addition then Subtraction). So for Tom's, $3+2$ is 5, then take away 1 is 4. But on the other side, $1+2$ is 3, then $3-3$ is 0. Since 4 and 0 aren't the same, Tom must be wrong.
