A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in order. You start with $n$, then subtract 5 which is $n-5$. Then you divide that whole thing by 8, which Jo wrote as a fraction. Then you add 4 to that part. Because the multiply by 7 is the very last thing, you need the big brackets around everything else so you multiply the whole sum by 7. Paul’s answer has the +4 outside the big brackets, so you would multiply by 7 and then add 4, which is the wrong way round.
