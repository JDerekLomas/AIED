A) Only Jo

I think Jo is right because she put the big brackets around the whole thing before multiplying by the 7 at the end. Paul just put the +4 on the outside, so you'd only multiply the middle bit by 7 and then add the 4 last, but the question says adding 4 happens before the final multiplication. Plus, Jo used a fraction line for dividing which we do in class.
