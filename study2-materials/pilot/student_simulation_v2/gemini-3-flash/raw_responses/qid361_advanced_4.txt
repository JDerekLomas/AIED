Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations described. By putting the addition of 4 inside the brackets before multiplying the whole thing by 7, she ensures the "finally multiply by 7" applies to the entire result. Paul’s expression is incorrect because, according to BIDMAS, he would multiply by 7 before adding the 4.
