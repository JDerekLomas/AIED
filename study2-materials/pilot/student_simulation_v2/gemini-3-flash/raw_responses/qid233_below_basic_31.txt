ANSWER: A

I think it's A because in maths you usually have to do things in the order they come in the question. The 2 and the 3 are at the start so I put them together to make a fraction, and then I just added the $ab$ at the end because letters usually go together. C and D look way too complicated with that long line at the bottom.
