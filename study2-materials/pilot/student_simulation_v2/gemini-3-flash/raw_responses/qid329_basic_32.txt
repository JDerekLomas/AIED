A) Only Tom

My thinking: I remember my teacher saying BIDMAS, and the D comes before S. That means you have to do the divide part first. Tom has put brackets around the divide bit, which shows you do that first anyway, so he must be right. Katie has swapped the numbers around, and you can't just do that with a minus because it changes the answer.
