ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because she used the brackets and the fraction bar properly to show that the entire "add 4" part happens before the final multiplication by 7. Paul's version is wrong because, according to BIDMAS, you would multiply the brackets by 7 first and then add 4 at the end, which isn't what the question says to do.
