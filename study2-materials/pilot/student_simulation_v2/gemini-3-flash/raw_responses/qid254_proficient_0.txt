ANSWER: A

I know that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in total including the zero. Since adding 0 doesn't change the total, the top part is just 1 + 3 + 4 + 7, but you still have to divide by 5 because the zero counts as a value in the data set. Option B is wrong because without brackets you’d only divide the 7 by 5.
