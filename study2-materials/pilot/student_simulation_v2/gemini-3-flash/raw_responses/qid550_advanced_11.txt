Both are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition.

In Tom's case, $3 + 2 - 1$ is the same as $3 + 2 + (-1)$. Since addition is commutative, the terms can be reordered as $3 + (-1) + 2$, which is $3 - 1 + 2$. Both expressions equal 4.

In Katie's case, according to BIDMAS/BODMAS, the multiplication ($2 \times 1$) is treated as a single term. She is simply swapping the order of the two terms being added ($3$ and $2 \times 1$). Both expressions equal 5.
