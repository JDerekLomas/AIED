A

The mean is the sum of all the numbers divided by how many numbers there are. Even though one of the values is 0, you still have to count it as part of the data set, so there are 5 numbers in total. 1+3+4+7 is the same as 0+1+3+4+7, and then you divide by 5. B is wrong because of BIDMAS (you'd only divide the 7 by 5), and C is wrong because it only divides by 4.
