ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has a divide sign in it and the question says to divide by 8. Jo's one has a line and that looks more like a fraction, and I don't really like fractions. Also, Paul's one has the +4 at the end and the question says you add 4 near the end, so that makes more sense to me.
