My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to follow BIDMAS, so multiplication definitely comes before addition, meaning you do $5 \times 6$ first. For Problem P, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. That means you do $4 - 5$ first. A lot of people get confused and think addition always comes first because 'A' is before 'S' in BIDMAS, but my teacher always says they are equal and you just go across.
