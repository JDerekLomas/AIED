ANSWER: C

I think it's C because in both ones the numbers are just being moved around but it's still the same sum. For Tom, 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, plus 2 is also 4. For Katie, you have to do the times bit first because of BODMAS, so 2 times 1 is 2, then add the 3 makes 5. It's the same on both sides of her equals sign as well.
