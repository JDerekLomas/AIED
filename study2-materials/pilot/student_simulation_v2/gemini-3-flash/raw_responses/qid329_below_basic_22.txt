B

I think it's B because when I do takeaways and divides, I always just put the bigger numbers first so it's easier to work out. Katie's one looks right because she put the 0.2 and 0.3 at the start and then the 0.1 at the end, and you're supposed to do the sum in the order it's written but maybe swap them if they're decimals. Tom just put brackets in and brackets always make it more confusing.
