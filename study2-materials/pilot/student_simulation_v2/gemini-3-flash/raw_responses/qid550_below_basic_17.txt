ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order on the other side of the equals sign. In the first one, the 2 and the 1 have swapped places, and in the second one, the 3 has moved from the front to the back. Usually, if you change the order of the numbers in a sum, you get a different answer, so they can't be the same.
