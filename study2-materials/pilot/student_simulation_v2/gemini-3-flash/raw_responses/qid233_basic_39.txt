ANSWER: C

My thinking is that when you do algebra, you have to put the letters together, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. Then the divide sign means it's like a fraction with the 2 on top. I looked at A but that one separates the 2 and the 3, and the bracket means they should stay together on the bottom. So C looks right because it has the 2 on top and the $ab$ and 3 underneath.
