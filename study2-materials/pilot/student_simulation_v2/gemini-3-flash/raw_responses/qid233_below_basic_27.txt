C

I remember my teacher saying that dividing is just like a fraction, so I looked for the one with the line. I know you're supposed to get rid of the times sign in algebra to make it look shorter, so it's probably C because it's the neatest one. A looks like two separate bits and I don't know where the brackets went in B.
