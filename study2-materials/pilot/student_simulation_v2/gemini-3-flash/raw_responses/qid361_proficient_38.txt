ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations perfectly. You have to subtract 5 first $(n-5)$, then divide that whole result by 8, then add 4 to that fraction, and finally multiply the *entire* result by 7 using the big brackets. 

Paul's version is wrong because he didn't put brackets around the $+ 4$. In his version, the multiplication by 7 only applies to the division part, and the 4 is just added on at the very end.
