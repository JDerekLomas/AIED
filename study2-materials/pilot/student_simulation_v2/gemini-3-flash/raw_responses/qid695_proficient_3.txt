ANSWER: B

My thinking: You have to follow BIDMAS, so you do the division and multiplication before the addition. $18 \div 2$ is $9$, and $2 \times 2$ is $4$. Then you just add them together ($9 + 4$) to get $13$. If you just went from left to right without thinking, you'd get a different answer, but I'm pretty sure $13$ is right.
