ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the brackets first, so \(2+2=4\). Then you do the division before the addition, which is \(12 \div 4 = 3\). Finally, \(4+3=7\). It’s easy to accidentally do the addition first and get 4, but I'm pretty sure you have to follow the order of operations.
