ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the actual question. It says "add 4" near the end of the sentence, and Paul put the +4 at the very end of his sum. Jo put the 4 inside the brackets with the other numbers which looks a bit weird and confusing. Also, I remember my teacher saying that the line in a fraction means divide, but the divide sign Paul used is easier to see.
