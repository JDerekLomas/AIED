ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a piece of data, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, so $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is the same as $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$.

B is wrong because of BIDMAS (it would divide 7 by 5 first), and C is a classic mistake where people forget to count the zero as a value.
