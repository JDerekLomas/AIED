ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the divide sign, you use a fraction bar instead. The 2 is at the start so it goes on top. Then for the bottom bit, $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you're supposed to hide the times sign. I picked C because it has the $ab$ together and the 3 is there too. I nearly picked A but the line didn't go under everything.
