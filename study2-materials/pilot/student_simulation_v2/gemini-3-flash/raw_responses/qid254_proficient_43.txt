ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding the 0 doesn't change the top sum (1+3+4+7), but you still have to divide by 5. B is wrong because of BIDMAS (it would only divide the 7 by 5), and C is wrong because it only divides by 4.
