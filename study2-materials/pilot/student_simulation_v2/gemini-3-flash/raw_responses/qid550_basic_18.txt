ANSWER: C

Both of them are right because in both sums they are just swapping the numbers around but keeping the same symbols. For Tom, 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, plus 2 is 4, so that's the same. For Katie, you do the 2 times 1 first because of BIDMAS, which is 2, then add the 3 to get 5. If you do it the other way, it's still 2 plus 3 which is 5. Since they both get the same answers on both sides, they are both correct.
