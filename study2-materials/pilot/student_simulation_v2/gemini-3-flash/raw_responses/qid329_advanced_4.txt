A

**Explanation:**
According to the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. Tom is correct because he uses brackets to show that the division part of the expression should be grouped together, which doesn't change the value of the original expression. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$, so swapping the terms around the minus sign changes the result.
