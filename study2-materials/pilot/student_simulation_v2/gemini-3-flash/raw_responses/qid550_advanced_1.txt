ANSWER: C

Both are correct because of the properties of addition and multiplication. Tom is correct because addition and subtraction have the same priority in the order of operations (BIDMAS), so as long as you keep the sign with the number (treating it as $+2$ and $-1$), the terms can be reordered. Katie is correct because of the commutative property of addition; since multiplication ($2 \times 1$) must be performed first in both cases, she is simply swapping the order of the two values being added ($3$ and $2$).
