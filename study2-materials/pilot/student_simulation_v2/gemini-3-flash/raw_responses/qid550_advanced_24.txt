Both Tom and Katie are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition. 

In Tom's case, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS/order of operations, so $3 + 2 - 1$ and $3 - 1 + 2$ both result in $4$. You can think of it as $3 + 2 + (-1)$ being rearranged.

In Katie's case, the multiplication must be performed first regardless of the order the terms are written in. Both expressions simplify to $3 + 2$, which equals $5$.
