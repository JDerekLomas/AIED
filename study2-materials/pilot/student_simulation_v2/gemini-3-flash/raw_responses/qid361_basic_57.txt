A) Only Jo

I think Jo is right because she put the big brackets around the whole adding 4 part before she multiplied by 7. Paul just put the +4 at the end outside the brackets, so you would only be multiplying the fraction bit by 7 and not the 4. My teacher says you have to do the stuff in the brackets first, and Jo's one looks like the steps in the question.
