ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is all inside the brackets, it has to go together on the bottom of the fraction. I almost picked D because it looks similar, but you have to get rid of the multiplication cross to follow the proper convention.
