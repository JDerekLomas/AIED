ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just do the first two numbers you see at the start of the sum. For Problem P, 4-5 is the first bit, and for Problem Q, 4+5 is at the beginning. My teacher says something about BIDMAS but I can't remember what order the letters go in, so I just go from left to right.
