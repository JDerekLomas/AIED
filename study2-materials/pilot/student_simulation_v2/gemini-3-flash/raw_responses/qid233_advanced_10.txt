ANSWER: C

Algebraic conventions require us to remove multiplication signs between variables, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. The division symbol is replaced by a fraction bar, with the entire expression in parentheses becoming the denominator. Since addition is commutative, $3 + ab$ is the same as $ab + 3$. Choice D is incorrect because it retains the multiplication sign.
