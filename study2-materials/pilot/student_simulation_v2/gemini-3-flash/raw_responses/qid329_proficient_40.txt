ANSWER: A

My thinking: According to BIDMAS, you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's equation is correct because putting the brackets around the division part doesn't change the order—you’d do that bit first anyway. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the subtraction around; $0.1 - (\text{something})$ is definitely not the same as $(\text{something}) - 0.1$.
