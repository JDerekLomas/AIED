ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16. Then I did the bit in the brackets, 2 + 2 is 4. So then I just had to do 16 divided by 4, which is 4. Oh wait, I looked at the options and 4 is D, but my friend said you have to do the divide bit earlier. If I do 12 divided by 4 that's 3, then 4 + 3 is 7. So I'll go with B.
