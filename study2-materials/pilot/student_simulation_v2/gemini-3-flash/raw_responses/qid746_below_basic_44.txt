ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, then I divided that by 2 to get 8, and then I took away the other 2 because it was in brackets, so I got 6... but that's not there. So I tried adding them all up: 4 plus 12 is 16, plus 2 is 18, plus 2 is 20. Then I just did 12 plus 2 which is 14 and halved it because of the divide sign, which makes 7. That's one of the options so it's probably that one.
