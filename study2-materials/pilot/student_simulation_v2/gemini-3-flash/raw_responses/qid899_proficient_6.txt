ANSWER: C

You have to follow BIDMAS (or BODMAS), where multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. Even though the subtraction is at the start of the expression, the $8 \times 7$ part has to be done first. It's easy to just read it left-to-right and think it's B, but that would give you the wrong answer.
