ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the divide sign, you use a fraction bar instead. The 2 is at the start so it goes on top. Then for the bottom bit, $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you're supposed to take the times signs out. I picked C because it has the $ab$ and the 3 underneath the line. A looked okay but the line only goes under the 2 and I think the whole bracket part has to be at the bottom.
