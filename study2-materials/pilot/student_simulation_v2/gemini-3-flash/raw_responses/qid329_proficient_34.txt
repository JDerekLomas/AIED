ANSWER: A

My thinking is that BIDMAS (or BODMAS) rules mean you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom is correct because putting brackets around the division doesn't change the calculation; it just confirms that $0.2 \div 0.3$ happens first. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the terms around the minus sign, which would change the answer from a negative number to a positive one.
