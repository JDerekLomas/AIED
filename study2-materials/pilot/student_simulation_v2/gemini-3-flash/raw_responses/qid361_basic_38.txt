A) Only Jo

My explanation: I followed the steps in the question. You have to do the $n-5$ first, then divide by 8, then add the 4. Jo put the 4 inside the big brackets, so when you multiply by 7 at the end, it's multiplying everything you've already done. Paul's one looks wrong because the +4 is outside the brackets, so you would multiply by 7 before adding the 4, which is the wrong order.
