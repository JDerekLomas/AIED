**Explanation:** To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one value is 0, it still counts as one of the 5 data points in the set. Therefore, you must divide the sum by 5. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as it only divides the 7 by 5 rather than the whole sum.
