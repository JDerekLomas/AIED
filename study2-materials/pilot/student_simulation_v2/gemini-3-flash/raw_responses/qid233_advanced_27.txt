ANSWER: C

Algebraic convention dictates that we remove the multiplication sign between variables (so \(a \times b\) becomes \(ab\)) and use a fraction bar instead of the division symbol. Since the entire expression \((3 + ab)\) is inside the brackets, it becomes the denominator. Addition is commutative, so \(3 + ab\) is the same as \(ab + 3\).
