A

**Explanation:**
According to the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules, division must be performed before subtraction. Tom’s statement correctly identifies this by placing parentheses around the division part, showing that $0.2 \div 0.3$ is subtracted from $0.1$. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$. Changing the order as she did would result in a different value (specifically, the negative of the correct answer).
