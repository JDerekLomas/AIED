**Explanation:**
Jo’s expression correctly follows the order of operations described. By putting the addition of 4 inside the brackets before multiplying by 7, she ensures the "finally multiply by 7" step applies to the entire previous result. Paul’s expression is incorrect because, according to BIDMAS/order of operations, the multiplication by 7 would only apply to the division part, and the 4 would be added at the very end, which misses the final instruction.
