ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, then I divided that by 2 to get 8, and then I took away the other 2 because it's in the brackets and that gave me 6, but that wasn't there. So I tried 4 plus 12 is 16, then 16 divided by 2 is 8, and I think I just picked 7 because it's the closest one and usually the answer is one of the smaller numbers.
