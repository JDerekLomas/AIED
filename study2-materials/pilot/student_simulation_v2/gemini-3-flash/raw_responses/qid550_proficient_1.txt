My thinking: Both are correct because of how the order of operations works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so they are equivalent. For Katie, multiplication comes before addition (BIDMAS), so in both cases you do the $2 \times 1$ first and then add the 3, giving 5 both times. Since the order of the terms doesn't change the result in these specific cases, both statements are true.
