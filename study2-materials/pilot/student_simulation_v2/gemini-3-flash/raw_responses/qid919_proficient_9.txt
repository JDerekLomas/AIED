ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to square the $x$ value first because of BIDMAS. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$. Then I multiply that by $3$, and $3 \times 0.09$ is $0.27$. You have to be careful with the decimal places; I almost went for D because $3 \times 3^2$ is 27, but the decimals make it much smaller.
