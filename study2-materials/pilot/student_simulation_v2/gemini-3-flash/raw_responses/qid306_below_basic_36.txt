ANSWER: C

I picked C because you always have to do the plus bits first. My teacher said something about BODMAS and the 'A' for addition comes before 'S' for subtraction, so in the first one you have to do the 5+6 first. Then in the other one, the 4+5 is at the start and plus is easier than timesing anyway.
