ANSWER: C

Both are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition. In Tom's case, $3 + 2 - 1$ is the same as $3 + 2 + (-1)$, and since addition is commutative, the terms can be reordered to $3 + (-1) + 2$. In Katie's case, she is treating the product $(2 \times 1)$ as a single term due to BIDMAS/BODMAS rules and simply swapping its position with the $3$, which is also mathematically sound.
