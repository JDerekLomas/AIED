ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is all inside the brackets, it has to go under the fraction bar together as the denominator. A is wrong because it looks like only the 2 is being divided by 3, and D still has the multiplication sign in it.
