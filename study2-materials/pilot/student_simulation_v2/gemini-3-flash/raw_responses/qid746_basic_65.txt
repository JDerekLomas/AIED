ANSWER: B

I did the plus bits first because I'm better at adding up. 4 plus 12 is 16, and then 2 plus 2 is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4, which is 4. But then I remembered my teacher saying you have to do the brackets first, so I did 2+2=4. Then I did 12+4=16 and divided it by 4, but that's still 4. Wait, if I do 4+12 first that's 16, then divide by 4... oh, I'll just go with B because 12 divided by 4 is 3, and 4 plus 3 is 7. That sounds more like the BIDMAS thing we did in class.
