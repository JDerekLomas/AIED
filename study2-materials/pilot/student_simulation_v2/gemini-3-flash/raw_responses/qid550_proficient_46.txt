ANSWER: C

My thinking: Both are correct because of how the order of operations works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so as long as you keep the minus sign with the 1, you can swap the order and still get 4. For Katie, multiplication comes before addition (BIDMAS), so in both her versions you do the $2 \times 1$ first and then add the 3, which gives 5 both times. They are just using the commutative property.
