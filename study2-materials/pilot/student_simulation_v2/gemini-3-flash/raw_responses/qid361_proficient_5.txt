ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations perfectly. You subtract 5 first $(n-5)$, then divide the whole thing by 8, then add 4 to that result, and finally multiply the entire expression by 7 using the outer brackets.

Paul's version is wrong because he didn't put brackets around the $+4$ part before multiplying by 7. In his version, only the division part gets multiplied by 7, and the 4 is just added at the end, which misses the "finally multiply by 7" step.
