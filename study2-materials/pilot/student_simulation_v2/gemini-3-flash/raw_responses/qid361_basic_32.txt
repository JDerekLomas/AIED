A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You have to take the number ($n$), take away 5, and then divide that bit by 8, which is what the fraction line means. Then you add 4 to that whole thing. Jo put the brackets around all of that before multiplying by 7 at the end, which makes sense because the 7 has to go with everything. Paul's one is wrong because he left the $+4$ outside the big brackets, so you'd only multiply the middle bit by 7 and not the 4.
