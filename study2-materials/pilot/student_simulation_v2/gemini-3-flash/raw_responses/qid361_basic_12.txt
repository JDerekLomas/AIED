A) Only Jo

My thinking: You have to do the +4 bit before you multiply by 7 because the question says "finally multiply by 7". Jo has the +4 inside the big brackets, so you do all that first. Paul's one has the +4 at the end outside the brackets, so you'd do the multiplying first and then add 4, which is the wrong order.
