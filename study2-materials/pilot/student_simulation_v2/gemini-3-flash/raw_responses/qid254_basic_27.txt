ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add all the numbers together and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I need to divide by 5. I didn't include the 0 in the top part of the sum because adding 0 doesn't change the total anyway, but I still counted it as one of the 5 numbers. B looks wrong because you have to do the adding first before the dividing.
