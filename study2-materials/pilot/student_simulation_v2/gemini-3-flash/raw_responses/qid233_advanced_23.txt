ANSWER: C

Algebraic convention dictates that we remove the multiplication symbol between variables ($ab$ instead of $a \times b$) and write divisions as fractions. Since the entire expression $(3 + ab)$ is inside the brackets and follows the division sign, it becomes the denominator. Addition is commutative, so $3 + ab$ is the same as $ab + 3$.
