ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I have to divide by 5. The 0 doesn't really add anything to the top part, so it's just 1+3+4+7, but I still have to count it as one of the numbers. B looks wrong because you'd only divide the 7 by 5 if you typed it like that in a calculator.
