ANSWER: C

My thinking was that the $a \times b$ part should be written as $ab$ because we don't use the multiplication sign in algebra. Then, since the $3 + ab$ is all inside the brackets, it has to go underneath the fraction bar. D is wrong because it still has the $\times$ sign, and A is wrong because it looks like only the 2 is being divided by 3, which isn't right. So, C is the neatest way to write it.
