A) Only Jo

I think it's Jo because she put the whole bit inside the big brackets. The question says you have to add 4 and *then* multiply by 7 at the very end, and Jo's brackets show you do the adding 4 first. Paul's one looks wrong because the 4 is just stuck on the end outside the brackets, so you'd multiply the fraction by 7 first and then add 4, which isn't what the instructions say to do.
