ANSWER: A

I think it's A because I remember my teacher saying that divide means you have to use a fraction line. I saw the 2 at the start so that goes on top, and then I just wrote the rest of the numbers out. The $ab$ part looks right because you're supposed to stick the letters together in algebra.
