ANSWER: C

I thought because the rule is $1 - 3n$, I just had to do $1$ take away $3$ and then put the $n$ next to it. $1 - 3$ is $-2$, and then I timesed that by $15$ (the $n$ part) and got $-30$. But that didn't look right, so I tried $15 - 1$ which is $14$, and since the sequence is going down, I just put a minus in front of it.
