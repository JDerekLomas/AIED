ANSWER: C

My thinking is that when you write maths properly in algebra, you have to put the letters together to show they are timesing, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. Then, the divide sign means you have to put it all in a fraction. I chose C because it has the 2 on the top and the $ab+3$ on the bottom. I almost picked A, but then I thought the divide line has to go under everything in the brackets.
