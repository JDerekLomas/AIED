ANSWER: A

I think it's Jo because the instructions say to add 4 and *then* finally multiply by 7. In Jo’s version, the +4 is inside the big brackets, so the whole thing gets multiplied by 7 at the end. Paul’s one looks a bit wrong because the +4 is outside the brackets, so you’d do the multiplication before the addition, which isn't what the question asks for.
