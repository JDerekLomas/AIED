ANSWER: C

I know that in algebra you don't really use the divide sign, you use a fraction line instead. So the 2 goes on the top. Then for the bottom bit, $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you don't need the times sign. I picked C because it has the 2 on top and the $ab$ together, even though the $ab$ and the 3 have swapped places, it's still the same stuff. A looked wrong because the line didn't go under everything.
