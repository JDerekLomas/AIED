A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You have to take the number ($n$), take away $5$, then divide it all by $8$, and then add $4$. Jo's one has the $+4$ inside the big brackets, so it all gets multiplied by $7$ at the end, which is what the question says. Paul's one has the $+4$ at the very end outside the brackets, so the $4$ wouldn't be multiplied by the $7$, and that feels wrong.
