My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to follow BIDMAS, so you do the multiplication ($5 \times 6$) before the addition. For Problem P, since addition and subtraction have the same priority, you just work from left to right, so you do $4 - 5$ first. I know some people think addition comes before subtraction because of the order of the letters in BIDMAS, but my teacher said you just go left to right for those two.
