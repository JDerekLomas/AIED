ANSWER: A

My thinking is that the divide sign means it should be a fraction, so I put the 2 on the top. Then for the bottom bit, I know that when letters are next to each other like $ab$ it means they are multiplied. I got A because the first part is $2 \div 3$ and then you just add the $ab$ at the end.
