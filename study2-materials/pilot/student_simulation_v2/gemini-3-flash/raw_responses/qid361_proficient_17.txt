ANSWER: A

I think it's Jo because the instructions say to add 4 and *finally* multiply by 7. In Jo's version, the +4 is inside the big brackets, so it gets multiplied by the 7 at the end. Paul's version has the +4 outside, so the 7 only multiplies the division part, which doesn't match the order of the steps.
