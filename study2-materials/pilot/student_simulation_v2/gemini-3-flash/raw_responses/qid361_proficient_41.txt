I think it's Jo because she used the big brackets around the whole expression before multiplying by 7. In the instructions, the "finally multiply by 7" means you have to do that to everything you've calculated so far. Paul's version only multiplies the first part by 7 and then adds the 4 at the very end, which doesn't follow the order of the steps.
