A) Only Tom

**Explanation:**
I remember BIDMAS/BODMAS, where division must be done before subtraction. Tom is correct because his brackets show the division happening first, which is the standard order of operations. Katie has swapped the order of the subtraction around (putting the 0.1 at the end), which would change the answer from a negative to a positive value. Therefore, only Tom's identity is true.
