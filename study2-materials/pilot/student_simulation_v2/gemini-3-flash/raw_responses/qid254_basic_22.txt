ANSWER: A

My thinking: To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list because you have to count the zero. C is wrong because it divides by 4, and B looks wrong because you have to do the adding first before the divide part. A has the 5 on the bottom so that must be it.
