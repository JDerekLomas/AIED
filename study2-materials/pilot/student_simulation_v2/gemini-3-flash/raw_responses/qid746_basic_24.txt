ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, and then I divided that by the 2 plus 2 in the brackets which is 4. So 16 divided by 4 gives 4, but that didn't feel right because of the order thing we did in class. So I tried doing 12 divided by 4 instead which is 3, and then added the 4 at the start to get 7.
