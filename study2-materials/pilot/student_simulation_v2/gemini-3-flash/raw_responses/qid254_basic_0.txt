ANSWER: A

My teacher said the mean is when you add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I have to divide by 5. I didn't include the 0 in the top part of the fraction because adding 0 doesn't change anything, so A looks right. B is wrong because you have to do the adding first before you divide.
