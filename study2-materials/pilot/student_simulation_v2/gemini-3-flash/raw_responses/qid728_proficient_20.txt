ANSWER: D

I looked at the options and did the BIDMAS for each one. For D, you do the brackets first which is 16 minus 6 (10) plus 4, giving you 14. Then you divide that by 2 which gives 7. A was a bit tricky because I thought 16 minus 5 might work, but that would be 11. D is definitely the right one.
