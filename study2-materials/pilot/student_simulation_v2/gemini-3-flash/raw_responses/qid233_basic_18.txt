ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the 'divide' sign, you use a fraction line instead. The 2 is at the start so that goes on top. Then for the bottom bit, $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you don't need the times sign. So I just put the $ab$ and the 3 together under the line. A looked okay but the line didn't go under everything, and D still has the times sign which my teacher says we shouldn't use.
