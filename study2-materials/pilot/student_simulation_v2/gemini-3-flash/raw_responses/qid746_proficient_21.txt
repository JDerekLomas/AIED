ANSWER: B

My thinking was to use BIDMAS. You have to do the brackets first, which is $2 + 2 = 4$. Then you do the division, so $12 \div 4 = 3$. Finally, you add the $4$ at the start, and $4 + 3 = 7$. If you just went from left to right without thinking, you'd get a different answer, but BIDMAS says division comes before addition.
