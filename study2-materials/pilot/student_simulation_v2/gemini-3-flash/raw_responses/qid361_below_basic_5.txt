B

My thinking: I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the question. It says "add 4" near the end and his one has the +4 at the very end of the line. Jo's one has the 4 inside the big brackets with the 7, and multiplying comes last so that doesn't feel right. I remember my teacher saying divide is the same as a fraction bar, but Paul's just looks more like the order you'd say it in.
