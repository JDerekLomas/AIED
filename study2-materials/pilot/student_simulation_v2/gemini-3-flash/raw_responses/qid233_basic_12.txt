ANSWER: C

I know that in algebra you don't really use the divide sign, you use a fraction bar instead. So the 2 goes on top and the rest goes on the bottom. You also don't need the times sign between $a$ and $b$, you just squash them together to make $ab$. I nearly picked A, but then I remembered the brackets mean the whole $3 + ab$ bit has to stay together under the 2.
