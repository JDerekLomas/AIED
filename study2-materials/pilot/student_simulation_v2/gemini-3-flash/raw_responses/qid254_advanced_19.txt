ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total number of values in the set. Even though one value is 0, it still counts as an observation. Therefore, I need to sum $0+1+3+4+7$ (which is the same as $1+3+4+7$) and divide by 5. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5.
