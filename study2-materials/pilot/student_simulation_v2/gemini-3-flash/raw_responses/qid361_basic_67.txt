A) Only Jo

I think it's Jo because she put the big brackets around the whole thing before she did the times 7 at the end. The question says "finally multiply by 7", so the 7 has to go on the outside of everything. Paul's one looks wrong because the +4 is outside his brackets, so you wouldn't multiply that bit by 7, you'd only multiply the division part.
