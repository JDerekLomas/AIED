ANSWER: A

I think it's A because of BIDMAS. You have to do the divide part first before the takeaway. Tom has put brackets around the divide bit which shows you do that first, so that makes sense. Katie has swapped the numbers around, but in a takeaway you can't just swap the order because you'd get a different answer.
