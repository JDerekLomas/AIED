ANSWER: B

My thinking: I followed the BIDMAS rules for the order of operations. First, I solved the calculation inside the brackets, which is $2+2=4$. Then I did the division, so $12 \div 4 = 3$. Finally, I added that to the $4$ at the beginning, so $4+3=7$. You have to be careful not to just go from left to right, or you'd get the wrong answer!
