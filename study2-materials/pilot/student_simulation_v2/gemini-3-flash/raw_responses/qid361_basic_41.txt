A) Only Jo

I think Jo is right because she put the big brackets around the whole thing before multiplying by 7 at the end. Paul just put the +4 on the outside, so only the first bit gets multiplied by 7, but the question says you do the adding and then "finally" multiply. Jo's one looks like the ones we do in class with the fractions.
