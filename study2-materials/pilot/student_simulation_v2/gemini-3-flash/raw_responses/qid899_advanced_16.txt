In the UK, we use the BIDMAS (or BODMAS) order of operations. Since multiplication takes priority over addition and subtraction, you must calculate $8 \times 7$ before doing anything else. Underestimating the hierarchy of operations is a classic mistake, but it's the standard rule for these types of expressions.
