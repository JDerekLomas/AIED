ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the steps in the question. Jo's one has that fraction thing and a big bracket, which usually means you have to do something else first. Plus, Paul put the +4 at the end and the question says "finally multiply by 7", so the 7 should be at the front like he wrote it. Jo's looks too complicated.
