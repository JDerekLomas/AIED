I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the actual question. You have to subtract 5 and then divide by 8, which is what he wrote with the divide sign, and then the +4 and the 7 are at the end just like the instructions. Jo's one has a big line and brackets in weird places which looks like a fraction and we haven't really done much of that yet. Also, Paul's just looks right because the numbers are in the same order as the sentence.
