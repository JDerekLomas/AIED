ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the exact order of operations described. By putting the $+ 4$ inside the brackets, the final step of multiplying by $7$ applies to the entire result of the previous steps. Paul is incorrect because his expression would multiply by $7$ before adding $4$, which changes the final outcome.
