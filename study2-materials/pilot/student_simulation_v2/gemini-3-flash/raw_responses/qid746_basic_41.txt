ANSWER: B

I did the plus bits first because I've seen that you have to do the brackets and the other side. 4 plus 12 is 16, and then 2 plus 2 is 4. So then it's just 16 divided by 4 which is 4, but that didn't feel right because of the divide sign in the middle. So I tried 12 divided by 4 which is 3, and then added the 4 at the start to get 7.
