ANSWER: C

I think it's C because the rule is $1 - 3n$, so I did $1 - 3$ which is $-2$, and then I timesed that by $15$. $2 \times 15$ is $30$, so it must be $-30$ or something close, but $15 - 1$ is $14$ and that's an option. I usually get mixed up with the $n$ bit, but $14$ looks like the right sort of number.
