ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order. My teacher said you have to do the sums in the order they are written, like reading a book. In Tom's one, the 2 and the 1 have swapped places, so it must change the answer. And for Katie, you have to do the plus first because it comes first, so if you move the 3 to the end it won't work anymore. None of them look right to me.
