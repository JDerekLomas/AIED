ANSWER: B

I think Katie is right because in maths you usually just do the sum from left to right. It starts with 0.1 and then 0.2, so I think you can just swap the numbers around as long as you keep the divide bit in the middle. Tom's answer has those brackets and they always make things more complicated, so it's probably not him.
