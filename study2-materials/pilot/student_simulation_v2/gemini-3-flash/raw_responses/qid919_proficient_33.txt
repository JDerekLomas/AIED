ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to square the $x$ value first because of BIDMAS. So $0.3^2$ is $0.09$ (since $3 \times 3 = 9$ and I need two decimal places). Then I just multiply that by $3$, and $3 \times 0.09$ gives $0.27$. At first, I almost picked D because I thought $0.3^2$ was $0.9$, but then I remembered the decimal point rule.
