ANSWER: B

I think Katie is right because usually in maths you just do the numbers in the order they come in, but since it's got decimals and divide signs, I remember my teacher saying you can sometimes swap them around. Katie’s one looks more like a proper sum where you put the bigger numbers first, and 0.2 and 0.3 look bigger than 0.1. Tom's just looks like the same thing but with extra brackets that don't really do anything.
