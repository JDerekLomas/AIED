B

I think it's B because Paul's one looks more like the actual question. The question says to add 4 and then multiply by 7 at the end, and Paul has the +4 and then the 7, whereas Jo has the 4 inside the brackets with the 7 on the outside, which looks like you'd have to do something else to it. Paul's just looks more like the right order.
