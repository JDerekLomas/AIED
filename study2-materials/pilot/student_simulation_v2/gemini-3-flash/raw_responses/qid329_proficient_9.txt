**Explanation:** Tom is right because of BIDMAS/BODMAS. Division has higher priority than subtraction, so you have to do $0.2 \div 0.3$ first anyway. Putting brackets around that part doesn't change the value, it just makes the order explicit. Katie is wrong because subtraction isn't commutative; you can't just swap the order of the terms around the minus sign without changing the result to a negative or positive version of itself.
