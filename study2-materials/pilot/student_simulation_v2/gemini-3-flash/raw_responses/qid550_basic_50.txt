ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right since you have to do the times first anyway (BIDMAS), and the numbers are just in a different order. But for Tom, I think he's wrong because you have to do them in the order they come, and if you swap the minus and the plus around, it changes the sum.
