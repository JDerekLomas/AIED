A) Only Jo

My thinking: Jo’s one looks right because it puts the whole fraction part inside the big brackets with the plus 4, so you do all of that before multiplying by 7 at the end. Paul's one is wrong because he put the 4 outside the brackets, so you'd multiply by 7 and then add 4, but the question says you have to add 4 first and then multiply by 7 last.
