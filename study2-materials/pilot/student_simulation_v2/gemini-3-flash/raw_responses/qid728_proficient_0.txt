ANSWER: D

I looked at the options and tried to use BIDMAS. If you put the brackets around the whole subtraction and addition part first like in D, you get $16 - 6 + 4 = 14$. Then you just divide that by $2$, which gives you $7$. Option A was a bit tricky because $16 - 5$ is $11$, and B and C both give $12$.
