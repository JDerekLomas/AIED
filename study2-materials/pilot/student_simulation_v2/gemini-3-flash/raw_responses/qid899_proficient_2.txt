ANSWER: C

You have to follow BIDMAS (or BODMAS), where multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. Even though the subtraction is at the start, you have to do the $8 \times 7$ first. I sometimes forget and just go from left to right, but my teacher always reminds us that the order of operations is really important.
