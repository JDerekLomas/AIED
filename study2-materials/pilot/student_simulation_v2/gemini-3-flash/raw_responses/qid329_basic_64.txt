ANSWER: A

I remember BODMAS from school, and the D comes before S, so you have to do the divide part first. Tom put brackets around the divide bit which shows you do it first, so that makes sense to me. Katie just swapped the numbers around, and you can't really do that with take-away because it changes the answer.
