ANSWER: A

I picked A because in the first one you just go from left to right, so you do the 4 minus 5 first. Then for the second one, I know there's a rule called BIDMAS but I can never remember if the add or the times comes first, so I just thought you'd do the first two numbers again like in the other one.
