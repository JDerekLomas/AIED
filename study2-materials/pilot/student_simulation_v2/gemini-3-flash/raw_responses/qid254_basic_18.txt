ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so it has to be divided by 5. You don't really need to add the 0 because it doesn't change the total, so you just do 1+3+4+7 and then divide the whole thing by 5. B is wrong because you'd only divide the 7 by 5 if you typed it like that into a calculator.
