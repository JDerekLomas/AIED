ANSWER: A

I think it's A because of BIDMAS. You have to do the divide part before the take away part, and the brackets in Tom's one just show that you're doing that bit first anyway. Katie's one is wrong because she's swapped the numbers around, and you can't just swap a take away like that or you'll get a different answer.
