A

**Explanation:** To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one value is 0, it still counts as an observation, so you must divide the sum (15) by 5. Option A correctly includes all non-zero terms in the numerator and divides by 5. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), as it would only divide the 7 by 5. Option C is incorrect because it divides by 4.
