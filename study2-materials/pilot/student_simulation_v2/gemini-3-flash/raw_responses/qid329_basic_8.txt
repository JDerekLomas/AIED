ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school, so you have to do the divide part first. Tom put brackets around the divide bit, and because you do brackets first anyway, it doesn't change the sum. Katie swapped the numbers around, and my teacher said you can't do that with take-aways because it makes the answer different.
