ANSWER: A

I think it's A because of BIDMAS. You have to do the divide part first before the takeaway. Tom has put brackets around the divide bit which shows you do it first, so that makes sense. Katie has swapped the numbers around, and you can't just swap a takeaway like that or you'll get a different answer.
