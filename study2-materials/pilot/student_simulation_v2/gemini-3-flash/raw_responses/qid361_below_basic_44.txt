ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Paul's one looks more like the normal way you write a math sum with the divide sign and the brackets. Jo's one has that big line like a fraction and that always confuses me, so it's probably wrong. Paul put the +4 at the end and the question says add 4 near the end, so that makes more sense.
