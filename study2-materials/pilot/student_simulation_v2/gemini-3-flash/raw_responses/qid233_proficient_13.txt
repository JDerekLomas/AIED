ANSWER: C

**My thinking:**
First, I looked at the part inside the brackets: \(3 + a \times b\). In algebra, we don't use the multiplication sign, so \(a \times b\) becomes \(ab\), making the bracket \((3 + ab)\). Then, the division sign \(\div\) should be written as a fraction bar with the 2 on top and the entire bracketed expression on the bottom. I chose C because \(ab + 3\) is the same as \(3 + ab\), and it follows all the rules our teacher taught us about simplifying expressions. A is definitely wrong because the fraction bar doesn't go under everything, and D still has the multiplication sign in it.
