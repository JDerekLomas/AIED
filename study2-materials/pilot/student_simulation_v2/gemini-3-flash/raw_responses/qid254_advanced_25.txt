ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total number of values in the set. Even though one of the numbers is $0$, it still counts as a data point, so there are $5$ numbers in total. Therefore, the calculation is $(0+1+3+4+7) \div 5$. Since adding $0$ doesn't change the numerator, option A is mathematically identical to the correct method. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the $7$ would be divided by $5$.
