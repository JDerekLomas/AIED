A

The answer is A because of BIDMAS. We always have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom has just put brackets around the division part, which doesn't actually change the sum—it just makes it clearer that you do the $0.2 \div 0.3$ first. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the subtraction; $0.1 - \text{something}$ is definitely not the same as $\text{something} - 0.1$.
