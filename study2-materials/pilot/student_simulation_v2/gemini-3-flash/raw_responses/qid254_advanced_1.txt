ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one of the values is 0, it still counts as an entry in the data set, so you must divide the sum by 5. Since $0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$, option A correctly represents the sum divided by the count of 5. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as it only divides the 7 by 5.
