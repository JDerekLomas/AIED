Both Tom and Katie are correct because they are demonstrating the **commutative property** of addition. 

In Tom's case, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS/BODMAS and are solved left-to-right. Treating them as $3 + 2 + (-1)$ shows that the terms can be reordered without changing the result (both sides equal 4). 

In Katie's case, multiplication must be performed before addition according to the order of operations. Both sides of her equation simplify to $3 + 2$, which equals 5.
