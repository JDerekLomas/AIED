ANSWER: A

My thinking is that BIDMAS (or BODMAS) rules mean you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's statement just puts brackets around the division part, which doesn't actually change the order of the calculation, it just makes it clearer. Katie's version swaps the numbers around, which would give you a different answer because subtraction isn't commutative. So Tom is right and Katie is wrong.
