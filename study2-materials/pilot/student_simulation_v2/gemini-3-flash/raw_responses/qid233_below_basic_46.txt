ANSWER: A

I think it's A because in maths you usually have to do things in the order they come in. So it's 2 divided by 3 first, which is the fraction part, and then you just put the letters on the end. I remember my teacher saying you take the times signs out when there are letters, so the $ab$ looks right.
