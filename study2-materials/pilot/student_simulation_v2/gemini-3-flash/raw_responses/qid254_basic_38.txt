ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so you have to divide by 5. B looks wrong because you'd only be dividing the 7 by 5, so it has to be A. The zero doesn't change the sum when you plus it, so it doesn't matter that it's not written on the top.
