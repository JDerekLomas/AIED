ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just do the first bit of the sum first. For Problem P, the 4 and 5 come first, and for Problem Q, the 4 and 5 are the first numbers you see so you just add them up before doing the times. I remember something about BODMAS but adding comes before taking away anyway, doesn't it? Or you just go from left to right because that's how you read it.
