ANSWER: C

I think it's C because they are both just swapping the numbers around and getting the same answer. For Tom's one, 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, then plus 2 is 4, so that's the same. For Katie's, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS. 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 is 5. It doesn't matter which way you write the plus 3, it still comes out as 5.
