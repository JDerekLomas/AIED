ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations perfectly. By putting the $(n-5)/8 + 4$ inside the brackets, the multiplication by 7 applies to the whole result. Paul’s version is wrong because his final $+ 4$ is outside the brackets, so the multiplication by 7 only applies to the division part, and you're supposed to multiply the final result (after adding 4) by 7.
