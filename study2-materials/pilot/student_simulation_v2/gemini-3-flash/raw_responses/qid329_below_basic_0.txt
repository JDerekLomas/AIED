B

I think it's B because when you have a take away and a divide, you just go from left to right like how you read a book. Katie has the same numbers but she's put the divide part first, and usually in maths you have to do the divide before you do the minus because of the BIDMAS rule. Also, the first one has brackets and brackets always make it more complicated, so it's probably the other one.
