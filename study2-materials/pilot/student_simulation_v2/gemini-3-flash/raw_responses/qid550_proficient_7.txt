My thinking: Both of them are correct. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BODMAS/BIDMAS, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so they are equivalent. For Katie, multiplication comes before addition, so you do $2 \times 1$ first in both cases. Both sides equal 5, meaning her statement is also a true identity.
