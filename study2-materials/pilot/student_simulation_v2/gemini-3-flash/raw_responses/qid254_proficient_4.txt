ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list (including the 0). Even though the 0 doesn't change the sum, it still counts as a data point, so you have to divide by 5. B is wrong because without brackets the division would only happen to the 7, and C is wrong because it divides by 4. So A is the correct way to write it.
