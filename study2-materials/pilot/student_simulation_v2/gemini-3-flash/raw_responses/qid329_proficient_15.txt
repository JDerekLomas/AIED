ANSWER: A

My thinking: According to BIDMAS, you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's version uses brackets to show exactly that, so his statement is definitely correct. Katie is wrong because she's swapped the order of the subtraction, which would change the answer from a negative number to a positive one. It’s a bit of a weird-looking question with the decimals, but it's just basic order of operations.
