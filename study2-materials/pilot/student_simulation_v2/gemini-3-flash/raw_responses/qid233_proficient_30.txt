ANSWER: C

**My thinking:**
First, I looked at the part inside the brackets. In algebra, we don't use the '×' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. This means the denominator should be $3 + ab$ (or $ab + 3$, it's the same thing). Then, the '$\div$' sign means the whole thing should be written as a fraction with 2 on the top. D looked okay, but it still has the multiplication sign, which isn't the proper convention we're taught in class. C is the neatest way to write it.
