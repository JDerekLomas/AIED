ANSWER: C

Both are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition. In Tom's case, addition and subtraction have the same priority (left-to-right), so $3 + 2 - 1 = 4$ and $3 - 1 + 2 = 4$. In Katie's case, the multiplication must be done first regardless of the order of the terms: $3 + (2 \times 1) = 5$ and $(2 \times 1) + 3 = 5$.
