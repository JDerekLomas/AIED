ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the formula is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$. Then I multiply that by 3, and $3 \times 0.09$ is $0.27$. I have to be careful not to do $3 \times 0.3$ first and then square it, because that would give me $0.81$ (A), but BIDMAS says indices come before multiplication.
