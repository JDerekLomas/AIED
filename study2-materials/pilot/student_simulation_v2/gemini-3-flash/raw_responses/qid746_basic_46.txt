ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, then I did the brackets which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4 to get 4, but that didn't look right so I tried it another way. I did 12 divided by 2 which is 6, then plus the other 2 is 8, plus the 4 at the start is 12. But my teacher said you have to do the brackets first, so 2+2 is 4. Then 12 divided by 4 is 3, and 4 plus 3 is 7.
