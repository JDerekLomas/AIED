A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in order. You do the minus 5 first (n-5), then the divide by 8, then the add 4. Jo's one has the +4 inside the big brackets, so when you multiply by 7 at the end, it does the whole thing. Paul's one has the +4 at the very end outside the brackets, so the 7 wouldn't multiply the 4, and you're supposed to multiply by 7 last.
