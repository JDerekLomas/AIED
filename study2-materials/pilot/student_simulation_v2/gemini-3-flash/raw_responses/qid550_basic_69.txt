ANSWER: C

My thinking: For Tom, 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, plus 2 is also 4. So he's right. For Katie, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS. 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 makes 5. It's the same on both sides of her equals sign, so they are both right.
