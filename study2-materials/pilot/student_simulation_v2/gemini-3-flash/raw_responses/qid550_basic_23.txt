ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one makes sense because you have to do the times first anyway (BIDMAS), and she's just moved it to the front. But for Tom, I think if you move the 1 you have to change the sign, and he's kept it as a minus in a different place which usually messes up the answer.
