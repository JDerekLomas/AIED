ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one has a times sign in it and I remember my teacher saying that BIDMAS means you have to do the multiplying first. Tom has just moved the numbers around and changed the minus and plus, and you aren't allowed to just swap them like that because minus is harder than plus. Katie's looks like the ones we did in class where the order matters more.
