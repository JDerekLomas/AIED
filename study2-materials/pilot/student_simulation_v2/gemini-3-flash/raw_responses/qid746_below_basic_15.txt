ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, then I divided that by 2 which is 8, and then I took away the last 2 because it's at the end, so I got 6... but 7 is the closest one to that so I picked B. Wait, or is it 4+12 is 16 and 2+2 is 4, and 16 takeaway 4 is 12? I'll just go with B because I remember my teacher saying something about dividing.
