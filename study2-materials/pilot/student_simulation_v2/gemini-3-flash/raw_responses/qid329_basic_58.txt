ANSWER: A

I think it's A because of BIDMAS. You have to do the divide part first before the takeaway, so Tom is right to put the brackets around the division to show it happens first. Katie has just swapped the whole thing around, and you can't do that with subtraction because $5 - 3$ isn't the same as $3 - 5$.
