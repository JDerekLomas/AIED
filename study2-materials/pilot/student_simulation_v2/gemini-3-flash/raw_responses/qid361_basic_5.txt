A) Only Jo

I think it's Jo because the question says the very last thing you do is multiply by 7. In Jo's one, the big brackets go around everything, so you do the plus 4 first and then times it all by 7. Paul's one has the 4 outside at the end, so you'd do the times 7 and then add the 4 last, which is the wrong way round.
