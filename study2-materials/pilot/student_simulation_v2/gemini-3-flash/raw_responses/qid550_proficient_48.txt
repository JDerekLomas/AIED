My thinking is that both of them are correct because they are just changing the order of the terms while keeping the signs the same. 

For Tom, $3+2-1$ is 4, and $3-1+2$ is also 4. Even though BIDMAS/BODMAS says addition and subtraction have the same priority, you usually work left to right, but as long as the minus stays with the 1, it works out fine. 

For Katie, $3+2 \times 1$ is $3+2=5$, and $2 \times 1+3$ is $2+3=5$. Multiplication always comes before addition, so it doesn't matter if the $2 \times 1$ is at the start or the end.
