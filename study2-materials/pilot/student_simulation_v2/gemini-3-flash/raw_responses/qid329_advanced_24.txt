A

**Explanation:**
According to the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. Tom is correct because his use of brackets explicitly shows the division being prioritized, which matches the standard order. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not equivalent to $b - a$.
