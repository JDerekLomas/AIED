**Explanation:**
According to the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. Tom’s statement correctly represents this by grouping the division in brackets, showing that the subtraction happens last. Katie’s statement is incorrect because she has changed the order of the terms; subtraction is not commutative, so \( a - b \) is not the same as \( b - a \).
