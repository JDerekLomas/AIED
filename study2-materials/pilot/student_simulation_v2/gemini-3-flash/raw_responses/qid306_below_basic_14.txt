ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just read the numbers from left to right, like when you're reading a book. So for the first one you do 4 minus 5 first, and for the second one you do 4 plus 5 first. I know there's that BIDMAS thing but I can never remember if the plus or the times comes first, so I just go in order.
