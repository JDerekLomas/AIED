ANSWER: C

I think they are both right because in the first one, it doesn't matter if you do the take away or the plus first, you still get the same numbers just in a different order. For Katie's one, BODMAS says you have to do the times first anyway, and $2 \times 1$ is the same at the start or the end, so it's just adding the 3 on. They both look like they work out the same.
