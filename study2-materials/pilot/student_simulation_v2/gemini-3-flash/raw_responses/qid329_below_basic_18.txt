My thinking is that Katie is right because usually in maths you just do the numbers from left to right like you're reading a book, but I think you have to swap them around sometimes when there's decimals. 0.2 and 0.3 are bigger than 0.1 so they should probably go first anyway. Tom’s looks too complicated with the brackets, and my teacher said we have to do the divide part first but Katie's one looks like it makes more sense.
