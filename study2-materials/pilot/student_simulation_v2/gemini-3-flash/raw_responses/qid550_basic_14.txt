ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right because you always have to do the times bit first (BIDMAS), and the 2 and 1 are still being timesed in her version. But for Tom's one, he's moved the numbers around and you're supposed to do them in the order they're written from left to right, so changing the order would change the answer.
