I used BIDMAS, so I did the brackets first: $2 + 2 = 4$. Then I did the division: $12 \div 4 = 3$. Finally, I added that to the $4$ at the start, which gives $7$. 

(I almost did $4+12$ first to get $16$ and then divided by $4$, which would have been $4$, but I remembered you have to do the division before addition!)
