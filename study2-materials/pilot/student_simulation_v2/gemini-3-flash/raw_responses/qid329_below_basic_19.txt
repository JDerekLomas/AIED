ANSWER: B

I think it's Katie because in the sum it says 0.1 first and then 0.2, but Katie's one has the 0.2 at the start and the 0.1 at the end, and usually when you do takeaways you just swap the numbers around to make it easier. Tom's one has brackets in it and I don't really get what brackets do, they just make it look more complicated.
