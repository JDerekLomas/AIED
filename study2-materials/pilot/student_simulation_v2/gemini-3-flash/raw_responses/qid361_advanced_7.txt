ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the exact order of operations described. By putting the $(n-5)/8$ and the $+4$ inside the outer brackets, she ensures the entire result is multiplied by 7. Paul’s expression is wrong because his $+4$ is outside the final set of brackets, meaning only the division part is multiplied by 7, which misses the "finally multiply by 7" instruction for the whole result.
