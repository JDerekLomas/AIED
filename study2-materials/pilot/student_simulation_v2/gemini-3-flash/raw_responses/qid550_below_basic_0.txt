ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right because of BIDMAS. You have to do the times bit first, and she's got the $2 \times 1$ in both of them just in a different place. But Tom's one looks wrong because you can't just swap the numbers around like that with a minus—it changes the sum. Tom's looks like he's trying to trick me, so only Katie is right.
