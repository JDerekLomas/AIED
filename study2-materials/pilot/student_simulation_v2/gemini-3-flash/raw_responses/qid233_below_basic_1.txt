ANSWER: A

I think it's A because I remember my teacher saying that divide means you have to put the first number on top of a fraction, and then you just write the rest of the numbers after it. The 2 is at the start so I put it over the 3, and then just wrote the + ab because you aren't supposed to draw the times sign in algebra.
