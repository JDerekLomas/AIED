ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of the way addition and multiplication work. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS, so you just go left to right. $3 + 2 - 1 = 4$ and $3 - 1 + 2 = 4$, so they are equal. For Katie, even though the order is swapped, the multiplication ($2 \times 1$) is always done first because it has higher priority than addition. So both sides equal $5$.
