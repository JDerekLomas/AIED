ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order. My teacher said you have to do the sums in the order they are written, like reading a book. In Tom's one, the 2 and the 1 have swapped places, and in Katie's one, the 3 moved to the end, so they can't be the same. Plus, I remember something about BIDMAS and the times sign means you have to do that bit first, which usually changes everything.
