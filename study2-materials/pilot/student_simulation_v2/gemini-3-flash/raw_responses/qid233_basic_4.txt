ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the divide sign, you use a fraction bar instead. The 2 is at the start so it goes on the top. Then for the bottom bit, $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you don't need the times sign when letters are touching. So it's $ab$ and then the $+3$, which looks like C. I thought about A but the line doesn't go all the way under, and D still has a times sign which my teacher says we shouldn't use.
