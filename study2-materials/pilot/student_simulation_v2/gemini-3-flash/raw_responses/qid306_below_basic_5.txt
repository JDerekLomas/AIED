ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just do the sums from left to right, don't you? In the first one, 4 comes before 5, so you do 4-5 first. In the second one, it's 4+5 first because the plus is at the start of the line. I remember something about BIDMAS but I can't remember if the A or the M comes first so I just go in order.
