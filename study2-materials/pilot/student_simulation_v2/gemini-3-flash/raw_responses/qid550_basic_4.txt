ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right. You always have to do the times first because of BIDMAS, and her answer has the $2 \times 1$ part in it both times, just moved around. 

I don't think Tom is right because you have to do the sum in the order it's written. $3 + 2$ is $5$, then take away $1$ is $4$. But if you do $3 - 1$ first that's $2$, and then plus $2$ is $4$... wait, they both equal $4$, but you aren't allowed to swap the plus and minus signs around like that, so he's probably wrong.
