ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the division ($18 \div 2 = 9$) and the multiplication ($2 \times 2 = 4$) first before doing the addition in the middle. So, $9 + 4 = 13$. It's easy to accidentally just go from left to right and get 22, but the rules say multiply/divide before adding.
