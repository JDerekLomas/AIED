A) Only Jo

My thinking was that you have to follow the steps in order. Subtracting 5 from $n$ gives $(n-5)$, then dividing by 8 gives $\frac{n-5}{8}$. Adding 4 to that whole thing gives $\frac{n-5}{8} + 4$. Since the very last step is multiplying the final result by 7, you need the big brackets around everything before it to make sure the 7 applies to the $+4$ as well. Jo's expression does this, but Paul's expression would only multiply the division part by 7 and then add the 4 at the end, which is wrong.
