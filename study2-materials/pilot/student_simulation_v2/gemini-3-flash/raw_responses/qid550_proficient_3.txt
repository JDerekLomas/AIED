ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of how BIDMAS (or BODMAS) works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. $3 + 2 - 1 = 4$ and $3 - 1 + 2 = 4$, so that's fine. For Katie, even though the order is swapped, you always do the multiplication first. So both sides are $3 + 2$, which equals 5. They are just using the commutative property of addition.
