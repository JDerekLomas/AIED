ANSWER: C

**My thinking:**
First, I looked at the part inside the brackets. In algebra, we don't use the '×' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. This means the denominator should be $3 + ab$ (or $ab + 3$). Then, the division sign $\div$ is written as a fraction bar in algebra. I almost picked A, but then I remembered that the division applies to the *entire* bracket, so the $3 + ab$ has to stay together underneath the 2. D is wrong because it still has the multiplication sign.
