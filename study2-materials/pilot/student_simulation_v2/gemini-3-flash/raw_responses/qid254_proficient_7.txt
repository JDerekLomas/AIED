ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, you still have to count it as part of the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. B is wrong because of BIDMAS (it would only divide the 7 by 5), and C is wrong because it only divides by 4. So A is the right one because adding 0 doesn't change the top number, but you still divide by 5.
