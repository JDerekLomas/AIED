ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school, and the D comes before the S. This means you have to do the divide part first before you do the takeaway. Tom put brackets around the divide part to show you do it first, which makes sense. Katie swapped the numbers around, but you can't really do that with subtraction because it's not like adding. So Tom is right.
