ANSWER: B

For Problem P, addition and subtraction have equal priority in the order of operations (BIDMAS), so you simply work from left to right. Therefore, you do \(4-5\) first. 

For Problem Q, multiplication takes precedence over addition, so you must calculate \(5 \times 6\) before adding the 4.
