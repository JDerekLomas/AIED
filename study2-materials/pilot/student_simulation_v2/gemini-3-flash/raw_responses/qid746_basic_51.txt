ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, and then I did the brackets 2 + 2 which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4 which is 4, but that didn't seem right because of the order of operations stuff my teacher said. So I tried it again doing 12 divided by 4 first which is 3, then I added the 4 at the start to get 7.
