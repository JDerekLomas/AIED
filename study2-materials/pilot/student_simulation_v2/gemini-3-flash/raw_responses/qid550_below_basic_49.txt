ANSWER: B

I think it's B because in Katie's one, the numbers are just swapped around and it's got a times sign, and my teacher always says you have to do the times part first because of BIDMAS. Tom's one looks wrong because you can't just move the take away sign like that, you have to do them in the order they're written from left to right, so the answer would change.
