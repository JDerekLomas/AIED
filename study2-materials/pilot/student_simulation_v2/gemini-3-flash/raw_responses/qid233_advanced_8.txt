ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). Multiplication comes before addition, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. The expression inside the brackets, $3 + ab$, becomes the denominator when dividing 2 by that entire group. We also don't use the multiplication symbol ($\times$) in final algebraic conventions, which makes C the correct simplified form.
