ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are five numbers in the list. I didn't include the 0 in the top part because adding 0 doesn't change the sum, but I still have to divide by 5 because the 0 counts as one of the numbers. B looks wrong because you have to do the adding first before the divide.
