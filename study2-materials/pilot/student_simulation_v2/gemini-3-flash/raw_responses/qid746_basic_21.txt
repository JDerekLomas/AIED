ANSWER: B

I think it's B because you have to do the bit in the brackets first, so 2 plus 2 is 4. Then I just did the rest from left to right, so 4 plus 12 is 16, and 16 divided by 4 is 4. Oh wait, I just saw the options and I did that wrong. If I do 12 divided by the 4 first, that's 3, and then 4 plus 3 is 7. My teacher said something about BIDMAS so you probably divide before you add.
