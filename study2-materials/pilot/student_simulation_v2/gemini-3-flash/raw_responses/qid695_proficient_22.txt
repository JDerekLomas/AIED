ANSWER: B

My thinking was to follow BIDMAS. First, I did the division ($18 \div 2 = 9$) and the multiplication ($2 \times 2 = 4$). Then I just added them together ($9 + 4 = 13$). It's easy to accidentally just go from left to right and get 22, but the order of operations means you have to do the plus last.
