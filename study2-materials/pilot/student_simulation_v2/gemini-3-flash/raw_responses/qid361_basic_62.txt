A) Only Jo

I think it's Jo because she put the whole bit inside the big brackets. The question says you have to add 4 and then "finally" multiply by 7, so the 7 has to multiply everything at the end. Paul's one looks wrong because the +4 is just stuck on the end outside the brackets, so you'd only be multiplying the first bit by 7 and not the 4.
