Tom is correct because of the standard BIDMAS/BODMAS rules. Division takes precedence over subtraction, so the calculation must be performed as $0.1 - (0.2 \div 0.3)$. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; swapping the order of the terms changes the result from negative to positive.
