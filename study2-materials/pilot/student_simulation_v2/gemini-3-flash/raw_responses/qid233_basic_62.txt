ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the divide sign, you use a fraction bar instead, so the 2 goes on the top. The bracket part \(3+ab\) should all go on the bottom. Choice A looks wrong because the 2 is only over the 3, and Choice D still has a times sign in it, which my teacher said we shouldn't use. I picked C because it squashes the \(a\) and \(b\) together like you're supposed to, and it's all underneath the line.
