ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the data set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, so $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is the same as $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$. B is wrong because without brackets you'd only divide the 7 by 5, and C is wrong because it divides by 4.
