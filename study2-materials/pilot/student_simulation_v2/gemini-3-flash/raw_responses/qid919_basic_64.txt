ANSWER: B

So I need to do $3 \times 0.3^2$. I did $3 \times 0.3$ first which is $0.9$, and then I squared it. $9 \times 9$ is $81$, so $0.9 \times 0.9$ must be $0.81$, but that's not right because I have to do 3 times the $x$ thing. If $x$ is $0.3$, then $0.3 \times 3$ is $0.9$, and $0.9 \times 0.3$ is $0.27$.
