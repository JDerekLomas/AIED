**Explanation:**
BODMAS (or BIDMAS) says we have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom is right because putting brackets around the $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ doesn't change anything; it just shows that part happens first. Katie is wrong because she's swapped the order of the subtraction, and $0.1 - \text{something}$ isn't the same as $\text{something} - 0.1$.
