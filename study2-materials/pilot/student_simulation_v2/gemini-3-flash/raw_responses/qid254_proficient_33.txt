ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the data set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Option A adds the non-zero digits and divides by 5, which is correct because adding 0 doesn't change the total sum. I almost picked B, but without brackets, BIDMAS means only the 7 would be divided by 5.
