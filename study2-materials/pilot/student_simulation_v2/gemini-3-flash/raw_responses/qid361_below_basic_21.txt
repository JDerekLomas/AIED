ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the actual question. You have to do the divide by 8 part and then add the 4 at the end, and Jo's one has a big line and the 4 is inside the brackets which looks confusing. Paul's one has the +4 at the end just like the sentence says. Plus, Jo's looks like a fraction and I hate fractions, they're always wrong.
