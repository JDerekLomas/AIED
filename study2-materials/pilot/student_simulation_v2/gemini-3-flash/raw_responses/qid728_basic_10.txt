ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you have to do the bit in the brackets first. 16 minus 6 is 10, then add 4 makes 14. Then you just divide the 14 by 2 which gives 7. The other ones didn't look right because BIDMAS says you have to do the divide first if there aren't brackets around the whole thing.
