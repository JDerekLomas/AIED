ANSWER: A

I picked A because in the question the 2 is at the beginning and then there's a divide sign, so I thought it should be 2 over 3. Then I just added the $ab$ on the end because I know in algebra you're supposed to stick the letters together to show they're timesing. B and C looked too complicated with the brackets and stuff.
