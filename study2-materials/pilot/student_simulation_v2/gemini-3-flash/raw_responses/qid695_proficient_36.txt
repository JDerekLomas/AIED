ANSWER: B

My thinking: You have to use BIDMAS for this one. I did the division first ($18 \div 2 = 9$) and then the multiplication ($2 \times 2 = 4$). Then I just added them together, $9 + 4 = 13$. If you just go from left to right without thinking about the order of operations, you'd get a different answer, but I'm pretty sure division and multiplication come before addition.
