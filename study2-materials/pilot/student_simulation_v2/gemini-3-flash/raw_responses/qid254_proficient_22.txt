ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as one of the values in the set, so you have to divide by 5. 1+3+4+7 is the same as 0+1+3+4+7, so A is the correct way to write it. B looks okay but it's wrong because of BIDMAS—you'd have to divide the 7 by 5 first before adding the rest.
