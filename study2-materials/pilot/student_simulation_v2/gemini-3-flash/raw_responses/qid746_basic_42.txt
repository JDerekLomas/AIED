ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, then I did the plus in the brackets so 2 + 2 is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4 which is 4. Wait, my teacher said something about brackets first, so I did 2 + 2 = 4, then I did 12 + 4 is 16 and 16 divided by 4 is 4. No, that's not right. If I do the brackets first it's 4, then 12 divided by 4 is 3, and then 4 + 3 is 7. That sounds more like what we did in class.
