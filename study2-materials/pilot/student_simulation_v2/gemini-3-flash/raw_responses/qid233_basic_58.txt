ANSWER: C

My thinking is that when you write algebra, you aren't supposed to use the multiply sign, you just squash the letters together, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. Then, the divide sign means you put the first number on top of a fraction line. I saw $ab$ and $3$ were inside the brackets together, so they both have to go on the bottom. Choice C looks the most like how my teacher writes it.
