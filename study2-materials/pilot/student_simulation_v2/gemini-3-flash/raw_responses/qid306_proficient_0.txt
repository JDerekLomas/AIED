My thinking: For Problem Q, you definitely have to do the multiplication first because of BIDMAS/BODMAS. For Problem P, since addition and subtraction have the same priority, you just work from left to right, so you do the $4-5$ first. I know some people think you have to do addition before subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, but my teacher said you just go in order.
