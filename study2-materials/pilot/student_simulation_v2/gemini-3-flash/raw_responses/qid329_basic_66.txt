ANSWER: A

I think it's A because of BIDMAS. You have to do the divide part first before the takeaway, so Tom is right to put the brackets around the 0.2 and 0.3. Katie has just swapped the whole thing around, and you can't really do that with subtraction because it's not like adding where the order doesn't matter.
