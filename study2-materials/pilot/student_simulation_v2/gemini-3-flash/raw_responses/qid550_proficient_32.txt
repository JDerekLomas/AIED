My thinking: Both of them are correct. For Tom's, since addition and subtraction are at the same level in BIDMAS, you just work from left to right. $3+2-1=4$ and $3-1+2=4$ as well. For Katie's, she's just swapped the order of the terms, but the multiplication still happens first either way ($3+2=5$ and $2+3=5$), so the identity holds. Everything seems to follow the rules of commutativity.
