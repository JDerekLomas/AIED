ANSWER: A

I think it's Jo because the question says to "finally multiply by 7", which means everything that happened before has to be inside the brackets. Jo's expression has the 4 inside the brackets with the 7 on the outside, which works. Paul's expression has the +4 at the very end outside the brackets, so the 7 is only multiplying the division part and not the 4.
