My thinking is that both of them are right because of how BIDMAS (or arithmetic rules) works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just go from left to right. $3+2-1=4$ and $3-1+2=4$ as well. For Katie, even though the order is swapped, the multiplication $2 \times 1$ always happens before the addition in both versions, so both sides equal 5. They are just showing that addition is commutative with other same-level or lower-level operations.
