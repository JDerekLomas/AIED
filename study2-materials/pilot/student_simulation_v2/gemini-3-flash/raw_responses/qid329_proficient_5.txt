A) Only Tom

**My thinking:**
It’s definitely Tom. Following BIDMAS (or BODMAS), you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom’s equation just puts brackets around the division part, which doesn't change the value; it just shows the order you’d do it in anyway. Katie has swapped the order of the terms around, and since subtraction isn't commutative, her version would give a different (positive) result.
