ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the brackets first, which is $2 + 2 = 4$. Then you do the division, so $12 \div 4 = 3$. Finally, you add the $4$ at the start, and $4 + 3 = 7$. It's easy to accidentally do $4 + 12$ first, but that would be wrong because of the order of operations.
