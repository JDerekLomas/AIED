ANSWER: C

My thinking is that the divide sign means it should look like a fraction with the 2 on top. Then for the bottom bit, \(a \times b\) just becomes \(ab\) because you don't need the times sign in algebra. I saw the 3 was being added so I just put that next to it. A didn't look right because only the 2 is over the 3, and D still has the times sign which my teacher said we shouldn't use.
