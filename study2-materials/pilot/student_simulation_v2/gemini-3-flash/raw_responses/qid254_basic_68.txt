ANSWER: A

My teacher said the mean is when you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. I counted 5 numbers in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, and 7). Even though 0 doesn't add anything to the top part, you still have to divide by 5 because it's one of the numbers. C is wrong because it only divides by 4, and B looks wrong because you'd only be dividing the 7 by 5 instead of the whole thing.
