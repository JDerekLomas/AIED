ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, and 7), so I have to divide by 5. I didn't include the 0 on top because adding 0 doesn't change the sum, but I still counted it as one of the numbers for the bottom part. B looks wrong because you have to do the adding first before the divide, and C only divides by 4.
