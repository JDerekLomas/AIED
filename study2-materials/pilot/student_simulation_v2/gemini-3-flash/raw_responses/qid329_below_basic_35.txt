ANSWER: B

I think Katie is right because in maths you normally just do things in the order they're written from left to right. Her one has the divide part first but it's got the same numbers, and I remember my teacher saying something about how the order doesn't matter if you just swap them around. Tom's looks way too complicated with the brackets and I always get those wrong.
