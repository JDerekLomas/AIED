A) Only Jo

My thinking: Jo’s one looks right because the big bracket goes around everything before you multiply by the 7 at the end. Paul’s one is wrong because the 4 is just sitting on the end outside the brackets, so you’d add it last instead of multiplying it by 7 like the question says. Jo used a fraction for the divide bit which is a bit confusing but it makes more sense with the brackets.
