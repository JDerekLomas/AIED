A) Only Jo

I think it's Jo because she put the big brackets around the whole middle bit before multiplying by 7 at the end. Paul's one looks like you only multiply the first part by 7 and then add the 4 separately at the very end, but the question says you have to add 4 and *then* multiply everything by 7. Jo's fraction thing also shows you do the subtract 5 and divide 8 part first.
