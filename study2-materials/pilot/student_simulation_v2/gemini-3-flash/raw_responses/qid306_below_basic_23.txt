ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just read the numbers from left to right like you're reading a book. In Problem P, the 4 and 5 come first, and in Problem Q, the 4 and 5 are the first ones you see too. I know there’s that BIDMAS thing but it's really confusing and adding usually comes before multiplying in the word, so I just do whatever is at the start.
