ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total number of values in the set. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, so $1+3+4+7$ is the same as $0+1+3+4+7$. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5. Therefore, A is the only correct expression.
