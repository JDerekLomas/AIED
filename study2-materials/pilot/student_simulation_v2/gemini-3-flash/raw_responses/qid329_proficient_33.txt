ANSWER: A

My thinking is that BIDMAS (or BODMAS) says you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's version uses brackets to show exactly that—doing the $0.2 \div 0.3$ first and then taking it away from $0.1$. Katie's version is wrong because she's swapped the order of the subtraction around, and $a - b$ isn't the same as $b - a$.
