A) Only Jo

My thinking: Jo’s one looks right because it’s got all the bits in the right order. You do the n-5 first, then the divide 8 is underneath, and then the +4 is inside the big brackets. Because the 7 is on the outside of the big brackets, it means you multiply everything by 7 at the very end. Paul’s is wrong because his 4 is outside the brackets, so you’d only multiply the first bit by 7 and then add the 4 last, which is the wrong way round.
