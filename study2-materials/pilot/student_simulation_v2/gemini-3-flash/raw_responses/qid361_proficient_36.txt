ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because their expression follows the full sequence of operations in the right order. The brackets around $(n-5)$ ensure you subtract before dividing, and the outer brackets ensure the $+4$ is included before you multiply everything by 7. 

Paul is wrong because, in his version, the multiplication by 7 only applies to the division part. According to BIDMAS, you'd do the multiplication and division first, then add the 4 at the very end, which misses the "finally multiply by 7" instruction.
