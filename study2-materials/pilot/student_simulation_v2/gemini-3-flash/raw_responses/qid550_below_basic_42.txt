ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you're not allowed to just swap the numbers around like that in maths. My teacher says you have to do the sums in the exact order they are written down, and if you move the minus sign or the times sign to a different place, the whole thing changes. Tom's looks wrong because the 1 and 2 have swapped places at the end, and Katie's looks wrong because she put the 3 at the back, so they must both be wrong.
