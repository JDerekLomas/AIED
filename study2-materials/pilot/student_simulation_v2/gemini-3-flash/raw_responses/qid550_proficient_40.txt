My thinking is that both of them are correct because they're just rearranging the order of the terms but keeping the symbols attached to the right numbers. 

For Tom, $3 + 2 - 1 = 4$ and $3 - 1 + 2 = 4$. Since addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS, you just work from left to right, so the order doesn't change the result here. 

For Katie, $3 + 2 \times 1 = 5$ and $2 \times 1 + 3 = 5$. Even though there's a multiplication, you do that bit first in both versions anyway ($2 \times 1 = 2$), and then add the $3$, so the answer stays the same.
