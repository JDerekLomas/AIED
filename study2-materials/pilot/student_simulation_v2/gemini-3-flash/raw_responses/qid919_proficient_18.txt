ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the formula is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$. Then I just need to multiply that by 3, and $3 \times 0.09$ gives $0.27$. At first I thought it might be 2.7 because $3 \times 3$ is 9 and $9 \times 3$ is 27, but I had to be careful with the decimal places.
