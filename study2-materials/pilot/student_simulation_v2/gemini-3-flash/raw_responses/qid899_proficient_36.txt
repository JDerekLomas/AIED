ANSWER: C

I used BIDMAS (or BODMAS), which is what we're taught in school to remember the order of operations. Multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so you have to do the $8 \times 7$ part first before you deal with the 10 or the 6. If you just went from left to right, you'd get the wrong answer.
