ANSWER: A

My thinking: Since the formula is $1 - 3n$, I just need to substitute $15$ in for $n$. So it’s $1 - (3 \times 15)$, which is $1 - 45$. That gives me $-44$. I had to be careful not to accidentally do $3 \times 15$ and then take $1$ away from it, which would have given me $44$, but since the $45$ is negative, it's definitely A.
