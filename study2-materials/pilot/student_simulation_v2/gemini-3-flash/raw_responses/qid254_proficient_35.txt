ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a piece of data, so you have to divide the total by 5. Since adding 0 doesn't change the sum, the top part is just $1+3+4+7$. B looks okay at first, but without brackets, the division would only apply to the 7 because of BIDMAS. So, A is the right one.
