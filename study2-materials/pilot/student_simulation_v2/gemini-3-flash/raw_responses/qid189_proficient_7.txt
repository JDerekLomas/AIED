A) -44

**Explanation:**
The question asks for the 15th term, so I just need to substitute $n = 15$ into the formula. $3 \times 15$ is 45, and then I have to do $1 - 45$. Since the 45 is being subtracted from 1, it becomes negative 44. I double-checked if it could be -46 because I sometimes mix up the signs, but $1 - 45$ is definitely -44.
