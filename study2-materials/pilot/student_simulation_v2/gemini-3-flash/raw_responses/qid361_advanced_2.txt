ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations described in the word problem. By putting the $(n-5)/8 + 4$ inside the outer brackets, the multiplication by 7 is applied to the entire result of the previous steps. 

Paul is incorrect because his expression only multiplies the division part by 7 and then adds 4 at the very end, which misses the "finally multiply by 7" instruction.
