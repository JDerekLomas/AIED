Namaste bachcho! Kaise ho sab? Aaj hum Rajasthan ke bare mein padhenge, hamare sundar desh ka ek bahut hi khaas rajya.

**Question:** Rajasthan mein paaye jaane wale koi bhi do prakritik sansadhan (natural resources) batao aur unmein se kisi ek ka logon ke jeevan par kya asar padta hai, yeh samjhao.

**Scoring Rubric:** Do sahi prakritik sansadhan batana (jaise paani, Marble, Copper, Ret, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, namak, Sooraj ki roshni (solar energy ke liye), Hawa (wind energy ke liye)).
**Max Score: 1**

Let's break down how my students would perform:

**Thinking Process for Percentage Prediction:**

1.  **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Natural resources" (prakritik sansadhan) is a key term. While I would have taught it in Hindi, seeing it in English might confuse many, especially the struggling and basic groups. "Influences the lives" (logon ke jeevan par asar) is also a phrase that needs careful understanding. I would definitely read the question aloud in Hindi first, then explain the English terms.

2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:**
    *   **Recall:** Naming two resources is pure recall. We would have covered this in class, perhaps through maps, pictures, or discussions about Rajasthan.
    *   **Reasoning:** Explaining the influence requires a bit of reasoning and connecting the resource to daily life. For example, if they say 'water', they need to connect it to farming, drinking, or animal rearing. If 'marble', they need to connect it to houses, statues, or livelihoods.

3.  **Specificity:** The question is quite open-ended ("any two"). This is good, as it allows for a wider range of correct answers. The explanation part also doesn't demand very deep analysis, just a basic connection.

4.  **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Only naming one resource:** Many might just recall one and stop.
    *   **Naming two but not explaining one:** They might miss the second part of the question due to language or oversight.
    *   **Naming non-natural resources:** Confusing man-made things with natural ones (e.g., "forts" or "camels" – though camels *use* resources, they aren't resources themselves).
    *   **Incorrect spelling/grammar:** While the rubric focuses on content, very poor articulation might make it hard to understand their answer. However, for this question, if the names are clear (even if misspelled) and the explanation is understandable, I'd give marks.
    *   **Difficulty with "influence":** Some might just describe the resource instead of explaining its *impact* on people's lives.

**Percentage Prediction:**

*   **struggling: 5% full marks**
    *   Many would struggle to even understand the question in English. Even with Hindi translation, recalling two specific resources and then explaining one's influence is a multi-step task that's challenging for them. They might name one resource or give a very vague answer.
*   **basic: 30% full marks**
    *   They would likely understand the question with translation. They might recall one or two resources. The challenge would be the explanation part – connecting the resource to daily life clearly. Some might list two resources but fail to explain one, or give a very short, incomplete explanation.
*   **competent: 75% full marks**
    *   They would generally understand the question. They would recall two resources easily. Most would be able to provide a decent explanation of one resource's influence, even if it's not super detailed. They might make minor errors in English phrasing but the core content would be there.
*   **advanced: 95% full marks**
    *   They would understand the question fully, even in English. They would recall multiple resources and pick two. Their explanation would be clear, concise, and accurate, demonstrating a good grasp of the concept and its application. They might even offer more than what's strictly required.
