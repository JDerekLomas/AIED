Okay, let's break this down based on my experience in an Indian government school, Class 8 Mathematics.

**Thinking Process:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The equation `y + 9 = 4` is fairly universal. The instruction "Find the value of y in the equation" might be a slight hurdle for the struggling and some basic students if they haven't seen this exact phrasing before, but the numbers and symbols are clear. I'd likely read it out loud in Hindi as "y ka maan gyat karo" (find the value of y) or "y ka kya uttar hai?" (what is the answer for y?). So, the language of the *question* itself is less of a barrier than the *equation*.

*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires recall of basic algebraic manipulation (isolating the variable) and reasoning for integer operations. The core concept is "what number, when 9 is added to it, gives 4?" This is where the challenge lies for many.

*   **Specificity of Answer:** The answer `y = -5` is very specific. No partial credit for `y + 9 - 9 = 4 - 9` if they mess up the subtraction.

*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **"Bade number se chhota number ghatao" (Subtract smaller from bigger):** Many students, especially struggling and basic, will instinctively do `9 - 4 = 5` and then struggle with the sign, or just write `y = 5`. They often avoid negative numbers if possible.
    *   **Sign Errors:** Even if they understand `4 - 9`, getting the `-5` correct is a common point of error. They might write `y = 5` or `y = -13` (adding instead of subtracting).
    *   **Transposition Errors:** Some might correctly transpose but forget to change the sign: `y = 4 + 9 = 13`. This is a very common mistake.
    *   **Lack of understanding of negative numbers:** This is the biggest hurdle. Many students in Class 8 still struggle to conceptualize negative numbers in a practical sense, especially when they result from a subtraction where the subtrahend is larger than the minuend.

**Percentage Breakdown:**

*   **Struggling (35%):** These students often lack a solid foundation in integer operations and basic algebraic concepts. The idea of `y` being a negative number is a significant conceptual leap for them. They will most likely do `9 - 4 = 5` and give `y = 5`.
    *   **struggling: 0% full marks** (They might get `y = 5` or `y = 13` but rarely `-5`.)

*   **Basic (35%):** These students might understand the concept of transposing `+9` to `-9` on the other side, but the calculation `4 - 9` is where they falter. Many will still default to `9 - 4 = 5` and struggle with the negative sign. Some might get `y = 13` due to sign error during transposition. A small fraction might get it right by rote memorization or a lucky guess with the sign.
    *   **basic: 10% full marks** (This 10% would be those who have a slightly better grasp of negative integers and transposition rules, perhaps from recent practice.)

*   **Competent (20%):** These students generally understand the rules of transposition and integer arithmetic. They've practiced similar problems. They might take a moment, but they should arrive at the correct answer. The potential for a minor slip-up (e.g., `4-9` becoming `13`) is still there if they rush, but less likely.
    *   **competent: 80% full marks** (Most will get it. The 20% who don't might make a silly calculation error or a momentary lapse in applying the sign rule.)

*   **Advanced (10%):** These students have a strong conceptual understanding and proficiency in calculations. This problem would be straightforward for them. They would solve it quickly and accurately.
    *   **advanced: 100% full marks**

**Final Answer:**

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 10% full marks
competent: 80% full marks
advanced: 100% full marks
