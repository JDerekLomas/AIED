Okay, let's break down this sentence rearrangement question for my Class 6 students, keeping in mind their diverse backgrounds and proficiency levels.

**Analysis of the Question:**
*   **"book/reading/a/is/he"**
*   **Required Answer:** "He is reading a book." (Subject-Verb-Object)
*   **Skills Tested:**
    *   Recognition of common English words (book, reading, is, he, a).
    *   Basic understanding of sentence structure (who is doing what?).
    *   Ability to identify a subject, a verb (and helping verb), and an object.
    *   Knowledge of present continuous tense formation.

**Challenges for my Students:**

1.  **Reading Comprehension:** Even though the words are simple, some struggling students might misread or not recognize "reading" or "a".
2.  **Vocabulary:** "Reading" might be known, but its function in a sentence might not be clear.
3.  **Grammar/Sentence Structure:** This is the biggest hurdle.
    *   Hindi sentence structure is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb), which is fundamentally different from English SVO. This often leads to errors like "He book is reading" or "He a book reading is."
    *   Understanding the role of "is" as a helping verb for "reading" in the present continuous tense is crucial. Many might place "is" at the end or incorrectly.
    *   The article "a" might be misplaced (e.g., "He is reading book a").
4.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires reasoning based on learned sentence patterns. For some, it might be recall if they've practiced this exact type of sentence extensively. For most, especially struggling and basic, it's reasoning.
5.  **Specificity:** The answer is very specific. Any deviation from SVO or incorrect placement of "is" or "a" would result in no marks.

**Common Mistakes I anticipate:**

*   "He book is reading." (Influence of SOV)
*   "He reading a book is." (Placing 'is' at the end)
*   "He is book reading a." (Misplacing 'a')
*   "Reading he is a book." (Starting with the verb)
*   "A book he is reading." (While grammatically correct, it changes emphasis and is not the most direct SVO, and likely not what's expected for a basic rearrangement task at this level).

**Percentage of Students Scoring Full Marks:**

*   **Struggling (35%):** These students often struggle with basic word recognition and have very limited understanding of English grammar. They might recognize "he" and "book" but struggle immensely with the verb phrase and word order. They're likely to produce very fragmented or incorrect sentences.
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks** (This would be the very few who might have seen this exact sentence or have a slightly better intuitive grasp than others in this group).

*   **Basic (35%):** These students can recognize most words but will be heavily influenced by Hindi sentence structure. They might get "He" and "book" in the right general area but will likely struggle with the placement of "is" and "reading" together, and "a". They might get close but make one or two critical errors.
    *   **basic: 30% full marks** (Some will get it through sheer practice of similar sentences, or by trial and error, but many will still make errors with 'is' or 'a').

*   **Competent (20%):** These students have a foundational understanding of English SVO structure and present continuous tense. They've likely practiced similar sentence rearrangements. They should be able to identify the subject, verb, and object fairly reliably.
    *   **competent: 80% full marks** (Most will get this right. A few might make a silly mistake or momentarily confuse word order, but the majority will apply the SVO rule correctly).

*   **Advanced (10%):** These students are comfortable with basic English grammar and can apply rules confidently. This type of question would be straightforward for them.
    *   **advanced: 100% full marks** (This is a very basic task for them; they would likely complete it quickly and accurately).
