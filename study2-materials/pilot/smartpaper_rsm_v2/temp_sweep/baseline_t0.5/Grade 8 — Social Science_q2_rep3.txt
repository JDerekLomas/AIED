This is a good question for Class 8, as it tests direct recall of a fundamental aspect of the Harappan Civilization. However, given the student profile, language and specific recall will be significant factors.

Here's my breakdown:

*   **Language barriers:** The question itself is relatively simple English, but recalling specific historical terms in English can be a challenge for Hindi-medium students. They might know the concept in Hindi but struggle to articulate it precisely in English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is purely a recall question. There's no reasoning involved, which can be both good and bad. Good because it's straightforward if they've memorized it. Bad because if they haven't, there's no way to deduce the answer.
*   **Specificity:** The required answer is quite specific. "Well-planned city" isn't enough; they need to mention *how* it was well-planned (grid, drainage, bricks, citadel/lower town).
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Vague answers:** "They had good cities."
    *   **Partial answers:** "They had good drainage" without elaborating on *why* it was good or *how* it was a feature of urban planning.
    *   **Incorrect terminology:** Mixing up features or using general terms instead of specific ones.
    *   **Language issues:** Knowing the concept but unable to phrase it correctly in English. For example, they might know "pakki eent" (baked bricks) but struggle to write "use of baked bricks."
    *   **Focusing on non-urban planning aspects:** Describing their trade or agriculture instead.

Given these considerations:

struggling: 0% full marks (They might recall "Harappa" but struggle with "urban planning" or specific features in English.)
basic: 15% full marks (Some might recall one feature like "good drainage system" or "baked bricks" if taught well and practiced. Many will give vague or incomplete answers.)
competent: 70% full marks (They would likely recall at least one specific feature and be able to articulate it reasonably well in English.)
advanced: 95% full marks (They would almost certainly recall multiple features and express one clearly and accurately.)
