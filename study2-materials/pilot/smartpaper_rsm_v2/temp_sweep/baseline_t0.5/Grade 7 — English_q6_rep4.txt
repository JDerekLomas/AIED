This is a challenging question for most of my students, especially given the "writing style" terminology. Here's my breakdown:

*   **Language barriers:** "Writing style" itself is a complex concept. Many struggling and basic students might not even understand what it's asking for, or they might confuse it with the *theme* of the poem or the *poet's feelings*. They might look for specific words in the poem rather than an overarching characteristic.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires reasoning and interpretation, which is harder than recall for most students. They need to analyze the poem's language, structure, and tone to deduce a style. If we haven't explicitly taught "writing style" and practiced identifying it, it's a new skill.
*   **Specificity:** "Simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct" are good answers, but they require a level of abstraction that many students haven't developed in English yet. They might offer very literal observations.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Confusing style with content (e.g., "The poet writes about nature," "The poet writes about happiness").
    *   Using very generic adjectives that don't quite fit "style" (e.g., "good," "nice," "beautiful").
    *   Not answering at all due to lack of understanding.
    *   Trying to copy phrases from the poem without understanding their relevance to style.

Given these factors, here's my estimate:

struggling: 0% full marks (They would likely not understand the question or give an irrelevant answer.)
basic: 5% full marks (A very few might stumble upon "simple" or "easy to understand" if the poem is indeed very straightforward, but it would be more luck than analysis.)
competent: 40% full marks (They have a better grasp of English and might have encountered the concept of "style" before, perhaps in Hindi. They could likely identify "simple" or "descriptive" if the poem lends itself to it.)
advanced: 80% full marks (These students are more likely to understand the nuance of "writing style" and can articulate an appropriate adjective. They might even offer more sophisticated terms if the poem allows.)
