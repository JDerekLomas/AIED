Okay, this is a very common scenario in my Class 7 English classroom. Let's break down how my students would likely perform on this question.

The question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." requires a blend of recall (understanding what the king's questions *were*) and reasoning (connecting them to real life and providing a justification).

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0-5% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Many in this group would struggle to even read and comprehend the question itself, let alone the passage. They might pick out keywords like "king," "questions," "important," but the nuance of "real life" would be lost.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Even if they vaguely remember the story, recalling the *specific* questions the king had is a challenge. Connecting them to "real life" and then articulating a reason in English is a multi-layered task beyond their current proficiency.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might just say "yes" without a reason, or give a very generic, unrelated answer. Some might just copy a sentence from the passage if they can find one that seems relevant, even if it doesn't directly answer the "why." They often lack the vocabulary and sentence structure to form a coherent, reasoned response.

**basic: 20-30% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They would likely be able to read the question, perhaps with some effort or a little help with a word or two. They'd understand the core idea.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might remember *that* the king had questions about "time," "people," and "things to do." They might even be able to list one or two of them if prompted. The "real life" connection is where it gets tricky. They might grasp the concept but struggle to articulate a *reason* clearly in English. Their reasons might be simplistic or not fully developed.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might say "Yes, because it is good to know the right time" or "Yes, because we need to know right people." The reason might be valid but very brief, lacking elaboration or strong connection to the "importance" in a broader sense. They might struggle with grammar and sentence construction, making their reason less clear.

**competent: 70-80% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue reading and understanding the question.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would easily recall the king's three questions. They would also readily see the "real life" connection. They have the vocabulary and grammatical structures to articulate a valid reason. They might say something like, "Yes, because knowing the right time to do things helps us succeed and avoid mistakes," or "Yes, because choosing the right people to work with ensures better outcomes."
*   **Common Mistakes:** A few might give a slightly less specific reason, or their English might have a minor grammatical error, but the core idea and validity of the reason would be present.

**advanced: 95-100% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue at all.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would not only recall the questions but also understand their universal applicability. They would provide a clear, well-articulated, and insightful reason, often using more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures. They might connect it to concepts like efficiency, success, decision-making, or avoiding regret. For example, "Absolutely, these questions are fundamental in real life because making informed decisions about the opportune moment, the correct action, and the suitable collaborators is crucial for achieving any goal effectively and avoiding negative consequences."
*   **Common Mistakes:** Extremely rare for this group on such an item. Perhaps a very minor spelling error, but the content would be perfect.
