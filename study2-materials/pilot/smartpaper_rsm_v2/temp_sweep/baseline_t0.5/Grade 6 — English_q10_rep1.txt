This is a classic "some/any" distinction, which can be tricky for students, especially those from Hindi-medium backgrounds. Let's break down the likely performance:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Many will struggle to read and comprehend the sentence itself, let alone the nuance of 'some' vs. 'any'.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires recall of a specific grammar rule (some for affirmative, any for negative/interrogative). They likely haven't internalized this rule yet.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might guess randomly, or pick 'any' because it's a shorter word, or simply not understand the question.

**basic:** 30% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They can read the sentence, but the 'some/any' rule might not be firmly established.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** Some might recall the rule if it's been explicitly taught recently, but many will still find it confusing. They might try to reason it out but get stuck.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might get confused between 'some' and 'any' in affirmative sentences, or simply not have enough practice with this specific grammar point.

**competent:** 75% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They will understand the sentence clearly.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They have likely been taught this rule and have a decent recall of it. They can apply the rule (affirmative sentence uses 'some').
*   **Common mistakes:** A small percentage might still make a mistake due to a momentary lapse or lack of recent practice, but generally, they should get this right.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** No issue here.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They will have a strong grasp of this basic grammar rule and apply it correctly without hesitation.
*   **Common mistakes:** Very rarely, a careless error might occur, but it's highly unlikely for this group.
