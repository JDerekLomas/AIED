Okay, let's break this down from my perspective as a Class 6 Social Science teacher in a government school in Rajasthan.

The question is: "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

**Analysis of the question:**

*   **Language:** The question is in English. This is a major hurdle for many of my students, especially the struggling and basic groups. "Natural resources" is a key term they might struggle to understand if not taught thoroughly in Hindi first. "Influences" is also a slightly complex word.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:**
    *   **Recall:** Naming two natural resources requires recall. We would have covered this in class, likely with examples and pictures.
    *   **Reasoning:** Explaining *how* one influences lives requires a bit of reasoning and connecting cause-and-effect. This is harder than just naming.
*   **Specificity:** Naming resources is fairly specific. Explaining influence can be broad but needs to be relevant.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Misunderstanding "natural resources":** They might list man-made things or just "things found in Rajasthan" without understanding the "natural" aspect.
    *   **Language barrier:** Not understanding the question at all.
    *   **Incomplete answers:** Naming two resources but failing to explain the influence.
    *   **Vague explanations:** "It is good for people" instead of specific impacts.
    *   **Focusing on only one resource:** If they name two but only explain one, they've met the criteria. If they only name one and explain it, they haven't met the "two resources" part.

**My Assessment of Student Performance:**

Let's assume we've covered this topic in class, using a mix of Hindi and English, pictures, and local examples.

*   **struggling (35% of students):**
    *   Many will struggle to read and comprehend the question itself.
    *   Even if they understand "natural resources," recalling two specific ones for Rajasthan might be hard without a lot of prompting.
    *   Explaining the influence in English will be extremely difficult for almost all of them. They might give a one-word answer or a very vague Hindi sentence if allowed.
    *   **Full marks:** Highly unlikely. Maybe 1-2 students out of this group might accidentally get it right if they've memorized a specific example well, but the language barrier for the explanation is too high.
    *   **struggling: 0% full marks** (They might get partial marks for naming one resource, but not full marks for both parts).

*   **basic (35% of students):**
    *   They will likely understand parts of the question, especially "natural resources" if we've drilled it. They might be able to recall two resources, perhaps with some effort (e.g., water, sand/desert, marble).
    *   The "explain how it influences" part is where they will falter. They might give a very simple, broken English sentence or resort to Hindi. They might grasp the concept but struggle with expression.
    *   **Full marks:** A small percentage might manage to string together a simple, correct explanation, especially if it's a very obvious influence (like water for farming/drinking). They'd need to have a slightly better grasp of English vocabulary.
    *   **basic: 5% full marks**

*   **competent (20% of students):**
    *   They will understand the question clearly.
    *   They will be able to recall two natural resources found in Rajasthan (e.g., Marble, Copper, Water, Salt, Sand).
    *   They will be able to provide a decent explanation of how one influences lives, even if the English isn't perfect. For example, "Marble is used to build houses and temples, and many people work in marble mines." or "Water is very important for farming and drinking in Rajasthan because it is a desert area."
    *   **Full marks:** Most of them should be able to achieve full marks.
    *   **competent: 70% full marks**

*   **advanced (10% of students):**
    *   They will understand the question perfectly and recall multiple resources.
    *   Their explanation will be clear, concise, and well-articulated, demonstrating a good understanding of the concept and decent English proficiency. They might even offer more nuanced explanations.
    *   **Full marks:** Almost all of them will score full marks.
    *   **advanced: 95% full marks**

**Final breakdown:**

struggling: 0% full
