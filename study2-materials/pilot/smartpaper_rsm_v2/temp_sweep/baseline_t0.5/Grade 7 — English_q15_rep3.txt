This is a common and relatively simple writing task, but given the specific context of an Indian government school, Class 7 English, with students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the expected full marks percentage needs careful consideration.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language Barriers:** Many struggling students would have difficulty comprehending the prompt itself, let alone formulating a response in English. They might pick out keywords like "hobby" but struggle with "when you do it" or "why you enjoy it."
* **Writing Structure:** The concept of a "paragraph" (4-5 sentences) would be challenging. They might write one or two disjointed sentences, or a list of words.
* **Vocabulary/Grammar:** Even if they understand the prompt, their limited vocabulary and grammatical knowledge would prevent them from constructing coherent sentences.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** While "My Favourite Hobby" is recall-based, articulating "why you enjoy it" requires a basic level of reasoning and expression that many struggling students lack in English.

**basic: 10% full marks**
* **Partial Comprehension:** Some basic-level students might understand the core idea of writing about a hobby. They might be able to state their hobby and perhaps one other detail.
* **Sentence Construction:** They would likely produce short, grammatically flawed sentences. The idea of linking them into a paragraph of 4-5 sentences would be difficult.
* **Completeness:** While they might mention the hobby, they would struggle to include all three required elements (when, why) in a clear and complete manner. They might say "I like cricket" and "I play everyday," but "why I enjoy it" would be very simplistic or missing.
* **Common Mistakes:** Subject-verb agreement errors, incorrect prepositions, and very simple sentence structures are common.

**competent: 60% full marks**
* **Good Comprehension:** Competent students would understand the prompt well and the need for a paragraph with specific details.
* **Sentence Formation:** They would be able to form grammatically acceptable sentences, though perhaps with some minor errors.
* **Paragraph Structure:** They would attempt to write 4-5 sentences and connect them, even if the flow isn't perfect.
* **Completeness:** Most would include all three elements (hobby, when, why), though the "why" might still be somewhat basic ("it makes me happy," "it is fun").
* **Vocabulary:** They would use a slightly wider range of vocabulary than basic students.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Full Comprehension and Execution:** Advanced students would easily understand the prompt and be able to construct a well-formed paragraph.
* **Grammar and Vocabulary:** Their sentences would be largely grammatically correct, and they would use appropriate vocabulary.
* **Elaboration:** They would not only include the three required elements but might also add a little more detail or slightly more sophisticated reasons for enjoying their hobby.
* **Fluency:** The paragraph would flow relatively well, demonstrating a better grasp of written English.
* **Minor Errors:** Even advanced students might make a minor spelling or punctuation error, but it wouldn't detract from the overall completeness and clarity of their response.
