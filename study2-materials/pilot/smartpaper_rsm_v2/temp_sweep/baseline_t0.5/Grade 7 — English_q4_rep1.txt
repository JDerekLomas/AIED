Here's my breakdown of how my Class 7 English students would perform on this question, keeping in mind their background and common challenges:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Most struggling students would not be able to comprehend the question itself, let alone the passage. "Important in real life" would be a major hurdle. They might recognize "king" and "questions" but the meaning would be lost.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires reasoning and connecting the story to real life, which is a higher-order skill they lack in English.
* **Common mistakes:** They would likely either write nothing, copy random words from the passage, or give a completely irrelevant answer in Hindi or broken English.

**basic: 10% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Some might grasp the literal meaning of "king's questions" and "important." However, "real life" would still be a challenge. They might struggle to articulate *why* it's important.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall the *content* of the questions (right time, right people, right thing) but struggle to connect it to a general concept of importance in real life.
* **Common mistakes:** They might state one of the king's questions as an answer (e.g., "It is important to know the right time.") without explaining *why* it's important in a broader sense. They might also give a very simplistic, one-word answer like "yes" without a reason. Only a few would manage to link it to making good decisions or being successful.

**competent: 60% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They would understand the question and the context from the passage reasonably well.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall the questions and are capable of making a basic connection to real-life relevance. They understand the concept of making good decisions.
* **Common mistakes:** Some might give a slightly vague reason, or their English might be a bit clunky, but the core idea of the importance of the questions would be present. They might focus on one question more than the others.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issues with understanding the question or the passage.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can easily recall the questions and articulate a clear, concise reason for their importance in real life. They might even offer a slightly more nuanced reason.
* **Common mistakes:** A very small percentage might rush and forget to give a *reason* after stating their opinion, or their reason might be slightly less developed than it could be. But generally, they would hit the mark.
