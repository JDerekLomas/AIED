This is a good question for Class 8 Social Science, as it focuses on a core aspect of the Harappan Civilization. However, given the student demographics and common challenges, the full marks percentage will vary significantly across ability groups.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Many struggling students will struggle to even understand the question "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning." The terms "feature," "urban planning," and "civilization" can be complex.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is primarily a recall question. Struggling students often have difficulty retaining specific factual information, especially if the teaching method hasn't been highly visual, repetitive, or in their native language.
*   **Specificity:** While the options are varied (grid layout, drainage, bricks, citadel/lower town), recalling *any* specific detail accurately and articulating it in English will be tough. They might remember "Harappa had good houses" but not "baked bricks" or "grid layout."
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might write something vague like "good city" or "they built houses." They might confuse it with other ancient civilizations if not clearly distinguished.

**basic: 30% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They will likely understand the question's gist, but articulating a precise answer in English might still be a challenge. They might use simpler language or make grammatical errors.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would have been exposed to this information. If the teaching involved diagrams, simple explanations, and perhaps some Hindi translation, they might recall one or two key points.
*   **Specificity:** They are more likely to recall a prominent feature like "good drainage system" or "streets were straight." They might struggle with terms like "citadel" or "grid layout" unless specifically emphasized.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might give a correct feature but fail to describe it adequately (e.g., just "drainage" instead of "advanced drainage system"). They might mix up features or provide incomplete answers.

**competent: 75% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They should be able to understand the question and articulate a correct answer, even if there are minor grammatical errors.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would have a solid grasp of the core facts. They've likely paid attention in class and reviewed their notes.
*   **Specificity:** They are very likely to recall and describe one of the key features accurately, such as the "grid pattern of streets" or the "elaborate drainage system." They might even mention the "use of baked bricks."
*   **Common Mistakes:** Minor errors in spelling or sentence structure, but the core information will be correct and identifiable. Some might list multiple features when only one is asked, but that still counts as full marks if one is correct.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here. They will understand the question perfectly and articulate a clear, concise, and accurate answer.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will have excellent recall of the information and likely understand the significance of these features.
*   **Specificity:** They will easily identify and describe one key feature with appropriate terminology (e.g., "The Harappan cities were characterized by a well-planned grid layout of streets, intersecting at right angles, dividing the city into rectangular blocks"). They might even elaborate slightly more than required.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Extremely rare. Perhaps a very minor oversight in wording, but the essence will be perfectly captured.
