This is a very common and fundamental question for Class 6 Social Science, especially in the Geography section. However, given the specific context of my students, I anticipate the scores will be distributed as follows:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Many will struggle to even read and comprehend the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." The terms "major," "mountain ranges," and "located" might be stumbling blocks.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall. If they haven't memorized or been able to associate the names with the concept of "mountain ranges in India," they'll struggle.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might write "Mount Everest" (a peak, not a range, and not entirely in India), or "Ganga" (a river). Some might just leave it blank or write something completely unrelated if they don't understand the question. Even if they know one, recalling a second one might be difficult.

**basic: 40% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They might be able to decipher the question with some effort, perhaps recognizing "mountain" and "India."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would likely have been exposed to the names of major mountain ranges in class. Many would remember "Himalayas" as it's the most prominent. Recalling a second one like "Aravalli" or "Vindhya" would be the challenge. Some might only recall one, thus not getting full marks.
*   **Common mistakes:** Only naming one range. Spelling mistakes might occur but wouldn't prevent them from getting the mark if the name is identifiable. Some might write "Deccan Plateau" confusing landforms.

**competent: 80% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They should be able to read and understand the question clearly.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would have a good grasp of the major physical features of India. Recalling at least two major mountain ranges like Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, or Eastern Ghats should be straightforward.
*   **Common mistakes:** Minor spelling errors, but the names would be clearly identifiable.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issue with understanding the question.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would not only recall two but likely several major mountain ranges with ease. They would have a strong conceptual understanding.
*   **Common mistakes:** Extremely rare, perhaps a very minor spelling slip, but they would definitely provide two correct names.
