This is a very common and fundamental question for Class 6 Social Science, especially in Geography. However, considering the specific context of my students, I anticipate the scores will vary significantly across the ability groups.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Many struggling students will not be able to read and comprehend "major mountain ranges located in India." They might pick out "India" and "mountain" but struggle with "ranges" and "major."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall. While we would have covered this in class, their ability to store and retrieve specific English terms is limited.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might write "mountain" or "hill" or even name a specific peak if they recall it, but not a "range." Some might even write something completely unrelated if they just pick up keywords.

**basic: 40% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Many in this group will be able to decode the question, especially if they've seen similar questions in Hindi or if I've emphasized key terms in class. They might still take some time to process it.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They have a better chance of recalling at least one major range, especially the Himalayas, as it's so prominent. They might struggle to recall a second one or spell it correctly.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Spelling errors are very common. They might write "Himalaya" but struggle with "Aravalli" or "Vindhya." Some might only remember one range.

**competent: 80% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** This group generally has a decent grasp of basic English vocabulary and can understand the question well.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would have a good recall of at least two major mountain ranges. They are likely to have practiced writing these names.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Minor spelling errors might occur for less common ranges, but they would definitely get one correct.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issues here. They will understand the question immediately.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will easily recall at least two, if not more, major mountain ranges and spell them correctly. They often enjoy showing off their knowledge.
*   **Common Mistakes:** A rare, careless spelling mistake might happen, but it's highly unlikely they wouldn't get at least one correct.
