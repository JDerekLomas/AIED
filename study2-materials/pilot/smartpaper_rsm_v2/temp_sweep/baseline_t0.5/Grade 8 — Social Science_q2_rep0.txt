Okay, let's break this down from my experience in a Class 8 government school.

The question asks for *one key feature* of Harappan urban planning. The rubric allows for several good answers.

Here's my thinking for each group:

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Key feature," "urban planning," "Harappan Civilization" – these are all terms that might be difficult to fully grasp in English, even if they've heard them in class. They might recognize "Harappan" but struggle with the rest.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is primarily recall. If they haven't memorized a specific feature in English, or if their understanding is vague, they'll struggle.
    *   **Specificity:** "One key feature" is specific enough, but they need to *know* one.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** They might write something too general like "they had cities" or "they built houses." They might confuse it with another civilization. They might just leave it blank because they don't understand the question or don't know the English term for a feature.
    *   **Prediction:** Even with some classroom exposure, getting a *specific, correct* feature in English will be tough for most. Maybe 1 out of 10 will get it right through sheer luck or a very basic, memorized phrase.
    **struggling: 10% full marks**

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** They will likely understand the question's intent, especially if we've discussed it in Hindi in class. They might struggle with *articulating* the answer perfectly in English.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Still recall. They might remember "nalli-system" (drainage system) or "pakki eent" (baked bricks) from Hindi explanations.
    *   **Specificity:** They know they need one feature.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** They might write "good drainage" instead of "advanced drainage system" or "streets were straight" instead of "grid pattern of streets." They might use a mix of Hindi and English. The rubric says "correctly describes," so "good drainage" might get partial marks, but "advanced drainage system" would be full. I'm assuming "full marks" means a clear, correct description.
    *   **Prediction:** Many will have a general idea and might try to translate it. Some will get close enough.
    **basic: 40% full marks**

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** They will understand the question clearly and have a decent vocabulary to articulate their answer.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Good recall is expected here. They would have paid attention and likely made notes.
    *   **Specificity:** They know what's required.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Might be a slight imprecision in terminology, but generally, they will hit the mark.
    *   **Prediction:** Most of these students will have a specific feature in mind and be able to write it down.
    **competent: 85% full marks**

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** No issue here. They are comfortable with English.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Excellent recall. They might even be able to list multiple features.
    *   **Specificity:** They will provide a precise and accurate answer.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Very few, if any, mistakes.
    *   **Prediction:** They will almost certainly get this right.
    **advanced: 95% full marks**
