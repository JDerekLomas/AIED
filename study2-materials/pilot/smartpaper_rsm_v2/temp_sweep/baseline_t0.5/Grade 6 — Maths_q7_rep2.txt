Here's my breakdown of how my Class 6 students would perform on this question, keeping all the factors in mind:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Temperature," "increases by," "per hour," "elapsed" – these are all complex English terms for them. Even if I read it out, they'd struggle to grasp the meaning.
* **Reasoning:** They would likely get stuck on the numbers themselves, without understanding the relationship between time and temperature change. They might just pick out numbers and try to add or subtract randomly.
* **Common Mistakes:** They might just add 30 and 2, or subtract 2 from 30. They wouldn't understand the concept of "per hour" or calculating the time difference.

**basic: 10% full marks**
* **Language Barrier:** Some might catch a few keywords like "temperature," "increases," "per hour" if I read it slowly and clearly, perhaps with some gestures. But understanding the full sentence structure would still be tough.
* **Reasoning:** They might understand that something is increasing, but calculating the elapsed time from 10 am to 4 pm is a significant step. They might count on their fingers, but often make mistakes.
* **Common Mistakes:** They might correctly identify that the temperature increases by 2 degrees, but struggle with the "per hour" aspect over multiple hours. They might calculate the time difference incorrectly (e.g., 4 hours instead of 6). Or they might just multiply 2 by 4 (the evening hour) instead of the total hours elapsed.

**competent: 60% full marks**
* **Language Barrier:** They would likely be able to understand most of the English terms, especially if I read it once or twice. They might ask for clarification on one or two words.
* **Reasoning:** They would grasp the concept of "increase per hour" and understand that they need to calculate the total time elapsed. Counting from 10 am to 4 pm would be manageable for most of them.
* **Common Mistakes:** Some might still make a small error in calculating the total hours (e.g., counting 10 am as hour 1 instead of the starting point, leading to 5 hours). A few might forget to multiply the increase by the number of hours and just add 2 to 30.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language Barrier:** They would have no problem understanding the question in English.
* **Reasoning:** This question primarily requires careful reading, understanding the concept of rate of change, and accurate time calculation. These students are good at these skills.
* **Common Mistakes:** A very rare silly mistake in counting the hours, but generally, they would get this correct. They would likely show their steps clearly.
