This is a classic grammar transformation question, and for my Class 7 students in a government school, it presents a good challenge. Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Many wouldn't even understand the instruction "Change... Active Voice to Passive Voice." The words "active" and "passive" are abstract grammatical terms that are difficult for them to grasp, especially without strong foundational English.
*   **Reading difficulty:** "The wind blew the leaves away" might be readable for some, but understanding the *meaning* deeply enough to manipulate its grammatical structure is another hurdle.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires both recall (of the passive voice structure, past participle of "blow") and reasoning (identifying subject, verb, object, and then re-arranging). They lack the recall.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They would likely just stare blankly, copy the sentence, or try to change a word or two without understanding the concept. Even if they understood "change the sentence," they wouldn't know *how*.

**basic: 5% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** A small fraction might vaguely remember "active" and "passive" from a previous lesson, but the concept is still hazy.
*   **Reading difficulty:** They can read the sentence and understand its basic meaning.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall that "by the..." is involved in passive voice, or that the object becomes the subject. However, the irregular verb "blew" transforming to "blown" is a major stumbling block. They'd likely use "blowed" or keep "blew." The auxiliary verb "were" is also a common omission or incorrect usage (e.g., "is blown").
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   "The leaves *was* blown away by the wind." (Subject-verb agreement error)
    *   "The leaves *blew* away by the wind." (Incorrect past participle)
    *   "The leaves *are* blown away by the wind." (Tense change)
    *   "The leaves *were* blowed away by the wind." (Incorrect past participle)
    *   Missing "by the wind" entirely.
    *   Only a very few, who might have a slightly better grasp of irregular verbs and auxiliary verbs, would get it right.

**competent: 40% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They understand the instruction and the concept of active/passive voice.
*   **Reading difficulty:** No issues reading or understanding the sentence.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They have a better grasp of the structure. The main challenge will be the irregular verb "blew" to "blown" and ensuring correct auxiliary verb ("were") and subject-verb agreement. Some might still make errors with "was" instead of "were" if they're not careful, or struggle with the past participle.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   "The leaves *was* blown away by the wind." (Still a common error for plural subjects if they rush or don't double-check.)
    *   A few might still struggle with "blew" to "blown" if they haven't practiced irregular verbs enough.
    *   A very small number might forget "by the wind."

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issues.
*   **Reading difficulty:** No issues.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They have a solid understanding of active/passive voice rules, including irregular verbs and subject-verb agreement. They would systematically transform the sentence.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   A rare, careless mistake like "was" instead of "were" or forgetting "by the wind." However, they are usually quite precise. They would likely identify "blew" as past tense, plural object "leaves," and correctly form "were blown."
