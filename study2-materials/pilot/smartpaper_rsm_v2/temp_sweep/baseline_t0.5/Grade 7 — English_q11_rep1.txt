This is a tricky question for my students, especially with the instruction to identify an "adjective phrase" when the correct answer is just a single adjective. This immediately introduces a potential point of confusion and error for almost all students, even the advanced ones, if they are looking for a *phrase*.

Here's my breakdown:

**Common Mistakes & Considerations:**

*   **"Adjective Phrase" vs. "Adjective":** This is the biggest hurdle. The rubric says "the student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective," but the question asks for an "adjective phrase." If a student correctly identifies "tiny" but then tries to expand it into a phrase (e.g., "a tiny bird," "its tiny nest"), they might be marked incorrect depending on how strictly "adjective phrase" is interpreted. If they *only* write "tiny," they might think they haven't answered the question fully. I will assume for this scoring that if they identify "tiny" as the *core* adjective, they get marks, even if they don't explicitly state it's *not* a phrase. However, the phrasing of the question itself will cause hesitation and confusion.
*   **Language Barrier:** Many struggling and basic students will not understand "adjective phrase" at all. They might look for any descriptive word or even a noun.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires recall of what an adjective is and then applying it to the sentence. The "phrase" part adds a layer of reasoning that might lead them astray.
*   **Reading Comprehension:** Some students will struggle to read and understand the sentence itself, let alone the grammatical instruction.
*   **Common Guesses:**
    *   "balcony" (a place, descriptive in a way)
    *   "nest" (a thing)
    *   "built" (an action, but descriptive of the bird)
    *   "our" (possessive, often confused with adjectives)
    *   They might underline the whole sentence if they don't understand.

Given the specific wording of the question ("adjective phrase") versus the expected answer ("tiny"), I anticipate significant confusion across all levels. I'll assume that *if they identify "tiny"*, they get full marks, despite the question's phrasing.

struggling: 5% full marks (A few might randomly pick "tiny" or remember it from a previous lesson, but the "phrase" part will confuse most.)
basic: 20% full marks (Some will know what an adjective is, but the "phrase" instruction will make many hesitate or try to find more words. They might identify "tiny" but doubt themselves because it's not a phrase.)
competent: 50% full marks (They know what an adjective is. The "phrase" part will be a major stumbling block. Some will confidently write "tiny" and explain why it's an adjective, ignoring the "phrase" instruction or assuming it's a trick. Others will get stuck trying to find a phrase.)
advanced: 70% full marks (They will likely identify "tiny" as the adjective. The "phrase" part will still cause hesitation. Some might write "tiny" and then add a note like "There is no adjective phrase, only an adjective." Others might try to force "a tiny bird" or "its tiny nest" as a noun phrase with an adjective, which wouldn't be correct for an *adjective* phrase.)
