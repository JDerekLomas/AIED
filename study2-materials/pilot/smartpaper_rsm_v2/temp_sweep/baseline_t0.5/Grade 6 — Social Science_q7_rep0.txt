Namaste bachchon! Kaise ho sab? Aaj hum Rajasthan ke baare mein kuch naya seekhenge.

**Question:** Rajasthan mein milne wale koi do prakritik sansadhan (natural resources) batao aur unmein se kisi ek ka logon ke jeevan par kya asar padta hai, samjhao.

**Thinking Process for Scoring:**

*   **Language Barriers:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Natural resources" (prakritik sansadhan) is a key term. If they don't understand this, they're lost. "Influences the lives" (jeevan par asar) is also crucial. I would have explained these terms in Hindi during the lesson.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Identifying two resources is recall. Explaining the influence requires a bit of reasoning, connecting the resource to daily life.
*   **Specificity:** The answer needs to be specific enough (e.g., "water for farming" or "marble for houses").
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Naming cities or famous places instead of resources.
    *   Naming man-made things (e.g., forts, clothes).
    *   Naming only one resource.
    *   Not explaining the influence, or giving a very vague explanation.
    *   Struggling with English sentence structure even if they know the answer in Hindi.

Let's break down the expected scores:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   These students often struggle with reading the question itself. Even if I've taught it in Hindi, translating their thoughts into English is a huge challenge. They might name one resource but struggle to explain its influence, or name something incorrect. A very small percentage might get lucky with two correct names and a very basic, broken English explanation for one.

**basic: 30% full marks**
*   They might be able to identify two resources (e.g., water and sand/marble). They might struggle with the "influences the lives" part in English, giving a very short or grammatically incorrect sentence. Some might get one resource and a decent explanation, but miss the second resource. Those who get full marks will likely have practiced similar questions and have a basic understanding of sentence construction.

**competent: 70% full marks**
*   These students generally understand the question. They can recall two resources easily (e.g., water, marble, copper, salt). They will be able to construct a reasonably coherent sentence explaining the influence, even if it's simple (e.g., "Water is used for farming and drinking. People need water to live."). They might make minor grammatical errors but the meaning will be clear.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   These students will not only identify two correct resources but will also provide a clear, well-structured explanation of how one influences lives. They might even give a slightly more detailed explanation or use slightly better vocabulary. They are less likely to make grammatical errors and will fully grasp the intent of the question. The 5% who might not get full marks could be due to a momentary lapse or misinterpretation of a specific word, or perhaps a very minor error that prevents a perfect score.
