This is a great question that makes me think deeply about my students' actual abilities and the common hurdles they face. Here's my assessment:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Many wouldn't even be able to read and comprehend the active voice sentence fully. "Blew" and "away" might be tricky.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires both recall of the passive voice structure (verb 'to be' + past participle) and reasoning to identify the subject/object and tense. They lack the foundational recall.
*   **Specificity:** The required answer is very specific. They are unlikely to get any part of it right.
*   **Common mistakes:** They would likely try to change individual words, or just repeat parts of the sentence. They wouldn't grasp the concept of voice change at all.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Some might be able to read the sentence, but understanding "blew" as the past tense of "blow" and its implication might still be a challenge for many.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall *that* there's a concept called "active/passive voice" but struggle with the specific rules for past simple tense. They might remember "by the..." but not the correct form of "to be" or the past participle.
*   **Specificity:** They might get parts right, like "The leaves..." or "...by the wind," but the core transformation of the verb (were blown) would be the biggest hurdle.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   "The leaves blowed away by the wind." (Incorrect past participle)
    *   "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Incorrect 'to be' verb agreement)
    *   "The leaves are blown away by the wind." (Incorrect tense)
    *   Missing "by the wind" entirely.

**competent: 60% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They would read and understand the sentence easily.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would have a good grasp of the passive voice structure for different tenses. They'd likely identify "blew" as simple past and know to use "was/were" + past participle.
*   **Specificity:** They are more likely to get the complete structure correct.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   A small percentage might still make a subject-verb agreement error ("The leaves was blown...").
    *   Some might forget "by the wind," especially if not explicitly told to include the agent.
    *   A few might struggle with the irregular past participle of "blow" if they haven't practiced it enough.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issue at all.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would instantly recognize the active voice, the tense, and apply the correct passive voice transformation without hesitation. They have strong recall of irregular verbs and grammatical rules.
*   **Specificity:** They would produce the exact, correct answer.
*   **Common mistakes:** A very rare, careless error might occur, but it would be an anomaly rather than a common mistake for this group. Perhaps omitting "by the wind" if they're rushing, but even then, they'd usually include it.
