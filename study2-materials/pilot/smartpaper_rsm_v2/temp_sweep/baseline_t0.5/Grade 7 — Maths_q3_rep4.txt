Okay, let's break this down based on my experience in a government school with Class 7 students.

**Thinking Process:**

1.  **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. "Area," "triangle," "base," "height," "cm" are all common mathematical terms, but for Hindi-medium students, reading and understanding the *entire sentence* can be a hurdle. They might recognize "triangle" and the numbers, but struggle with "area" and "height." I'd often have to translate or explain these terms in Hindi during class.

2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question is almost purely recall. They need to remember the formula for the area of a triangle. Once recalled, the application is straightforward substitution. There's very little complex reasoning involved beyond that.

3.  **Specificity of Answer:** The required answer is very specific: using the formula `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. There's no partial credit for just multiplying base and height, for example.

4.  **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Forgetting the 1/2:** This is *extremely* common. Many will just multiply 8 x 6.
    *   **Confusing with area of rectangle/square:** Some might just multiply the two numbers given, thinking it's similar to a rectangle.
    *   **Incorrect units:** Some might forget to write "cm²" or write "cm". While the rubric only focuses on the formula, it's a common error.
    *   **Calculation errors:** Simple multiplication/division mistakes.
    *   **Not understanding "base" and "height":** While the numbers are given, some might struggle if they were presented with a diagram. Here, it's explicitly stated.
    *   **Language comprehension:** As mentioned, some might not even grasp what "area" means or what they are being asked to find.

Now, let's apply this to the different ability groups:

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   Many will struggle with reading the English question itself.
    *   Even if they understand, recalling a specific formula like `1/2 * b * h` is a significant challenge. They might remember "something with multiplication" but forget the "1/2".
    *   They are more likely to just multiply 8 x 6 or leave it blank.
    *   *Percentage full marks:* Very low.

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   They might understand the question with some effort or if key terms are highlighted.
    *   They might recall *a* formula for area, but often confuse it with a rectangle or forget the `1/2`.
    *   Some might correctly recall the formula but make a calculation error.
    *   They are on the cusp of understanding but often miss a crucial detail.
    *   *Percentage full marks:* Low to moderate.

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   They will understand the question clearly.
    *   They are generally good at recalling formulas taught in class.
    *   They are less likely to forget the `1/2` and perform calculations accurately.
    *   *Percentage full marks:* High.

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   They will have no problem understanding the question or recalling the formula.
    *   They will apply it correctly and perform the calculation accurately.
    *   They might even write the units correctly without prompting.
    *   *Percentage full marks:* Very high.
