This is a great question that really makes me think about my students! Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Many wouldn't even understand the instruction "Change... Active Voice to Passive Voice." The terms themselves are abstract and often not fully grasped even in Hindi.
*   **Reading comprehension:** "The wind blew the leaves away" might be understood literally, but the grammatical structure is complex for them.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recall of the passive voice structure and the ability to apply it. They lack the foundational knowledge for recall.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might just repeat the sentence, change a word randomly, or try to translate it literally into Hindi and back, resulting in gibberish. They wouldn't know about "was/were" or the past participle form.

**basic: 5% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Some might vaguely recall "active" and "passive" if we've drilled it, but the understanding is superficial.
*   **Reading comprehension:** They'd likely understand the meaning of "The wind blew the leaves away."
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They might remember a *pattern* for passive voice (e.g., "object first") but struggle with the auxiliary verb ("were") and the correct past participle ("blown").
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   "The leaves blow away by the wind." (Missing auxiliary verb, wrong verb form)
    *   "The leaves was blew away by the wind." (Incorrect auxiliary verb 'was' for plural 'leaves')
    *   "The leaves are blown away by the wind." (Incorrect tense - present instead of past)
    *   They might get "by the wind" right, but the core transformation of the verb is where they'd falter.
    *   A very small number, perhaps those who paid extra attention during a specific lesson, might get it exactly right.

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They would understand the instruction and the original sentence.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They've likely been taught the rules for passive voice and can recall them. The challenge is applying them consistently and accurately, especially with irregular verbs.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Common error with 'was' vs 'were' for plural subjects, especially if they rush or aren't thinking carefully about subject-verb agreement.)
    *   "The leaves are blown away by the wind." (Tense error, changing past to present.)
    *   Some might forget "by the wind" or place it incorrectly.
    *   However, a good half of this group would likely get it perfectly, having understood the concept and practiced it enough.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issues here.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would recall the rules for passive voice transformation, including subject-verb agreement for the auxiliary verb and the correct past participle form. They would apply it systematically.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Even in this group, a tiny percentage might make a careless error, like "The leaves was blown away..." due to rushing or momentary lapse, but it would be rare.
    *   They are generally quite adept at identifying the object, choosing the correct auxiliary verb based on tense and number, and using the past participle.

This type of question is a good discriminator, showing a clear progression of understanding across the ability levels.
