This is a classic sentence structure rearrangement task, and while it seems simple, the nuances of an Indian government school Class 6 classroom, especially with the described student profile, make it quite interesting.

Here's my breakdown:

**Understanding the Task & Common Pitfalls:**

*   **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure:** This is the core concept being tested.
*   **Vocabulary:** All words are common and likely known, or at least recognizable, even to struggling students.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** It's more reasoning based on learned sentence patterns, but for those who struggle, it might feel like recall if they've memorized similar sentences. For others, it's applying the SVO rule.
*   **Specificity:** The answer is very specific: "He is reading a book." There's little room for variation without being incorrect.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Missing capitalization/punctuation:** While not explicitly asked for in the prompt, in a full writing task, this would be a common error. For just rearrangement, it's less of an issue unless they put a random capital in the middle.
    *   **Incorrect word order:** "Reading he is a book," "A book he is reading," "Is he reading a book?" (if they try to make a question).
    *   **Confusion with 'is':** Some might struggle with the auxiliary verb 'is' and its placement.
    *   **Reading difficulty:** Many struggling students might not even be able to read all the words correctly, let alone understand their meaning and grammatical function.

**Percentage Breakdown:**

*   **Struggling (35% of students):**
    *   These students often have significant difficulty with basic English reading and comprehension. Even recognizing all the words might be a challenge.
    *   They likely haven't internalized SVO structure consistently.
    *   They might try to just put words together randomly or based on what sounds vaguely familiar.
    *   *Prediction:* **5% full marks** (These would be the ones who either got lucky, have seen this exact sentence before, or are on the very cusp of moving out of the struggling category).

*   **Basic (35% of students):**
    *   They can usually read the words, but understanding grammatical rules and applying them consistently is hit-or-miss.
    *   They might get the subject and verb right, but struggle with the object phrase or the auxiliary verb placement.
    *   They might produce sentences like "He reading is a book" or "He is a book reading."
    *   *Prediction:* **40% full marks** (Many will get close, but a significant portion will make a minor error in word order. Some will get it right through practice or by recognizing the common phrase "He is reading").

*   **Competent (20% of students):**
    *   These students generally understand basic sentence structure and can apply SVO rules.
    *   They are likely to recognize the "Subject + is + Verb-ing + Object" pattern.
    *   They might pause for a moment but will arrive at the correct answer.
    *   *Prediction:* **85% full marks** (A small percentage might make a silly mistake under pressure or if they momentarily confuse the order, but most will get this correct).

*   **Advanced (10% of students):**
    *   These students have a solid grasp of English grammar for their age.
    *   This task would be straightforward for them. They would likely identify the subject, verb, and object almost instantly.
    *   *Prediction:* **100% full marks** (This is a foundational skill for them).

**Summary:**

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 40% full marks
competent: 85% full marks
advanced: 100% full marks
