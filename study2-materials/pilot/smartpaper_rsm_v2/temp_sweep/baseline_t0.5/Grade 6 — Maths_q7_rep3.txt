Here's my breakdown of how my Class 6 students would perform on this question, keeping all the context in mind:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. The English is too complex for them. Even if I read it out, the concepts of "increases by... per hour" and "elapsed time" would be difficult to grasp.
* **Reasoning:** Calculating elapsed time from AM to PM, especially across noon, is a significant challenge for this group. They might just subtract 10 from 4, or get confused with the 12-hour clock.
* **Common Mistakes:**
    * Not understanding the question at all.
    * Incorrectly calculating time elapsed (e.g., 4-10 = -6, or 10-4=6, but not understanding it's an increase).
    * Just adding 2 to 30, or multiplying 2 by 4.
    * Not knowing what to do with the "per hour" part.

**basic: 10% full marks**
* **Language Barrier:** Some might pick up a few keywords like "temperature," "increases," "per hour," but the overall sentence structure would still be a struggle. They'd need significant help understanding the question.
* **Reasoning:** A few might be able to calculate the time elapsed with some prompting or if they've practiced similar time problems. However, the multi-step nature (time elapsed * rate + initial temp) is still quite complex.
* **Common Mistakes:**
    * Calculating time elapsed incorrectly (e.g., 4 hours, or 14-10=4 if they convert 4 PM to 24-hour format but don't know what to do next).
    * Multiplying 2 by 4 (thinking it's 4 hours).
    * Forgetting to add the initial temperature.
    * Getting the time elapsed correct but making a calculation error in the multiplication or addition.

**competent: 50% full marks**
* **Language Barrier:** They would likely understand the core of the question, perhaps needing a little clarification on a word or two. They can usually pick out the key numbers and operations.
* **Reasoning:** They have a good chance of calculating the time elapsed correctly (10 am to 4 pm is 6 hours). They understand "per hour" means multiplication. The multi-step nature is within their grasp.
* **Common Mistakes:**
    * A few might still make a small error in calculating the time elapsed (e.g., counting 5 hours instead of 6).
    * A minor arithmetic error in multiplication or addition.
    * Forgetting to add the initial temperature (less likely, but possible under pressure).

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language Barrier:** No significant issue. They would comprehend the entire question easily.
* **Reasoning:** They would quickly identify the initial temperature, the rate of increase, and the need to calculate the time elapsed. Calculating 6 hours from 10 am to 4 pm is straightforward for them. They'd perform the multiplication and addition accurately.
* **Common Mistakes:**
    * Extremely rare, but a very minor arithmetic slip (e.g., 6 * 2 = 14 instead of 12) if they rush.
    * Misreading a number (e.g., 30 as 20).
