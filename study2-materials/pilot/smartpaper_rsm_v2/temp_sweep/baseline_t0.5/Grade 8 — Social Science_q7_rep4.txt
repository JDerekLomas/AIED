This is a great question that really makes me think about my students! Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Many wouldn't even be able to fully comprehend the question itself, let alone formulate an answer in English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires recall of a specific event and its immediate political consequence. While they might vaguely remember "Plassey" and "British won," connecting it to "political dominance/control over Bengal" and "puppet nawab" is too specific for them.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might write "British became powerful" or "British got money," which isn't specific enough for the full mark. They often struggle with cause-and-effect relationships beyond the most basic level.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Some might grasp the core of the question, but expressing it clearly in English is a hurdle.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall that the British won Plassey and that Mir Jafar became Nawab, but making the explicit connection that he was a "puppet" and it led to "political control over Bengal" is where many will fall short. They might say "British got control" but not specify *how* (through a puppet) or *where* (Bengal).
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might say "British got powerful" or "British started ruling," which is close but lacks the specificity of "political dominance/control over Bengal" and the "puppet nawab" aspect. Only a few would string together the key elements.

**competent: 60% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Most would understand the question and be able to articulate a reasonable answer in English, even if grammatically imperfect.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would likely recall the victory, Mir Jafar, and the British gaining influence. The concept of a "puppet" would probably be within their grasp. They understand that winning a battle leads to power.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Some might miss the "political dominance over Bengal" part and just say "British became rulers" or "British got power in India." However, a good number would connect Mir Jafar to being a puppet and the British gaining control over Bengal.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would easily recall the facts and understand the political implications. They would likely use terms like "puppet ruler," "political control," and specify "Bengal." They understand the strategic importance of Plassey.
*   **Common Mistakes:** The only reason it's not 100% is that sometimes even advanced students can have a momentary lapse in recall or might phrase it slightly imperfectly, missing one small nuance required for the *absolute* full mark, though their understanding would be clear. They might say "British gained control of Bengal" but not explicitly mention Mir Jafar as a puppet, which might be too strict for a full mark depending on the exact interpretation of the rubric.
