Here's my breakdown of how my Class 6 students would perform on this question, considering their background and common challenges:

**Thinking Process:**

1.  **Language Barrier:** The biggest hurdle is the English. "Temperature," "increases by," "per hour," "evening" – these words would be difficult for a significant portion of my students, especially the struggling and basic groups. I would likely have to read it aloud and translate key terms into Hindi for them to even begin understanding the problem.

2.  **Time Calculation:** Calculating the time elapsed from 10 am to 4 pm is a common point of error. Many might just subtract (4-10, which is tricky with am/pm) or count on their fingers but make a mistake. They might count 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 and get 7 hours, or miss one. The "6 hours" is specific.

3.  **Core Math Concept:** Once the time is calculated, the multiplication (6 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 12 degrees increase) and addition (30 + 12 = 42 degrees) are relatively straightforward for those who understand the problem. However, the rubric *only* scores for calculating the time elapsed. This simplifies things for the scoring but means students might get the time right but the final answer wrong, or vice-versa, and only the time calculation counts.

4.  **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Misinterpreting "per hour":** Some might just add 2 degrees once.
    *   **Incorrect time calculation:** As mentioned, getting 5, 7, or even 8 hours instead of 6.
    *   **Not understanding "increases by":** Some might subtract instead of add.
    *   **Ignoring the initial temperature:** Some might just give 12 degrees as the answer.
    *   **Language confusion:** Not understanding the question at all.

**Percentage of Students Scoring Full Marks (on *calculating the time elapsed* as 6 hours):**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   **Language:** Almost all would struggle to understand the question independently. Even with translation, the concept of "per hour" and calculating elapsed time is a multi-step process.
    *   **Time Calculation:** Many would make errors in counting or calculating the hours. They might count 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 and get 7 hours, or get confused by the switch from am to pm.
    *   **Full Marks:** I'd expect very few to get *exactly* 6 hours.
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks**

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   **Language:** A significant portion would still need help with understanding the English. With some translation, they could grasp the core idea.
    *   **Time Calculation:** Many would try to count the hours on their fingers. Some would get it right, but a good number would still make a mistake (e.g., 5 or 7 hours). They are capable of counting, but precision is often an issue.
    *   **Full Marks:** A noticeable number would get the 6 hours correctly, but it wouldn't be the majority.
    *   **basic: 30% full marks**

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   **Language:** Most would be able to read and understand the question with minimal or no assistance.
    *   **Time Calculation:** They are generally good at mental math and counting. They would likely count 10-12 (2 hours), 12-4 (4 hours), total 6 hours, or just count sequentially and accurately.
    *   **Full Marks:** A high percentage would accurately calculate the 6 hours.
    *   **competent: 80% full marks**

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   **Language:** No issues at all.
    *   **Time Calculation:** This would be very straightforward for them. They'd likely do it mentally and quickly.
    *   **Full Marks:** Almost all would get this part correct.
    *   **advanced: 95% full marks**
