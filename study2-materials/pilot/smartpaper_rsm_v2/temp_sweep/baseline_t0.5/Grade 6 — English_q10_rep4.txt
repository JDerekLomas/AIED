Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 6 students in a government school, keeping in mind their diverse backgrounds and proficiency levels.

The question "There are (some/any) apples in the basket" tests a common grammatical rule about countable nouns and affirmative sentences.

Here's my assessment:

*   **Language barriers:** The sentence structure is fairly simple, and the words 'apples' and 'basket' are likely familiar. The main challenge will be understanding the nuance between 'some' and 'any'. Many students might just be guessing if they don't grasp the rule.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires recall of a grammatical rule (using 'some' in affirmative statements, 'any' in negatives/questions). However, for those who haven't explicitly learned or internalized this rule, it becomes a 50/50 guess, which is a form of 'reasoning' for them, but not the intended one.
*   **Specificity:** The answer is very specific – only 'some' is correct.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Random guessing due to lack of understanding of the rule.
    *   Over-generalizing 'any' because they've heard it used in questions or negatives.
    *   Not distinguishing between affirmative and negative sentences.
    *   Simply picking the word that "sounds" better to them, which can be hit or miss.

Here's my estimated breakdown:

struggling: 10% full marks
basic: 30% full marks
competent: 70% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
