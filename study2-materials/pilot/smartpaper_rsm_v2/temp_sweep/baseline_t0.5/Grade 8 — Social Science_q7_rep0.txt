This is a good question that targets a core concept in the Class 8 Social Science syllabus. Given the student profile, I'll break down my estimation carefully.

Here's my thinking:

*   **Language Barriers:** This is a major hurdle. The question is in English. Even if they know the answer in Hindi, translating it accurately and concisely into English to meet the rubric's specificity is tough. Many will struggle to even understand the question fully.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires recall of a specific consequence of the Battle of Plassey. While understanding "how it contributed" involves a bit of reasoning, the core answer (political dominance/puppet nawab) is a factual recall point.
*   **Specificity:** The rubric requires explaining *that* the victory led to *political dominance/control over Bengal* (and ideally mentioning Mir Jafar). This is quite specific. A general answer like "British became powerful" or "they got money" wouldn't get full marks.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Misunderstanding the question:** "How did it contribute?" might be interpreted as "What happened in the battle?" or "Why did it happen?"
    *   **Lack of specific vocabulary:** They might know the concept but lack the English words like "political dominance," "puppet nawab," "control over Bengal."
    *   **General answers:** "British got powerful," "British got rich," "British started ruling." These are too vague for full marks.
    *   **Focusing on economic aspects:** Many students remember the economic exploitation (diwani rights, revenue collection) more readily than the immediate political control.
    *   **Incomplete answers:** Mentioning Mir Jafar but not explicitly linking it to British political control.

Here's my breakdown by ability level:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*   They will struggle to read and comprehend the question itself. Even if they've heard of Plassey, articulating its *contribution to expansion of power* in English will be nearly impossible. They might write something completely irrelevant or just "British won."

**basic:** 10% full marks
*   Many will understand that Plassey was important for the British. They might say "British became powerful" or "British started ruling."
*   A small percentage, who have a slightly better grasp of English and recall of the specific event, might be able to articulate "British got control of Bengal" or "Mir Jafar became their puppet." The challenge will be the *specificity* and *language*. They might get partial marks but full marks are unlikely for most.

**competent:** 50% full marks
*   These students generally understand the concepts and have a better vocabulary. They would likely recall Mir Jafar and the British gaining control.
*   The challenge for some would still be the precise wording to match the rubric's "political dominance/control over Bengal." Some might just say "British started ruling Bengal" which is close but could miss the "political dominance" aspect. Those who explicitly mention Mir Jafar as a puppet would score well.

**advanced:** 90% full marks
*   These students have a good grasp of both the content and the language. They would be able to articulate clearly that the victory led to British political dominance over Bengal, often mentioning Mir Jafar as a puppet ruler, thereby establishing a foothold for further expansion. They are more likely to use the precise terminology required.
