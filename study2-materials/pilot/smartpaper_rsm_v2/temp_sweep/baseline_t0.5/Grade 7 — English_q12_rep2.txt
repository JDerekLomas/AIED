This is a classic grammar transformation question, and for my Class 7 students in a government school, it presents a good challenge. Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** Many wouldn't even understand the instruction "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice." The terms "active voice" and "passive voice" are abstract and new for them. They'd struggle to read and comprehend the original sentence itself.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recall of the passive voice structure and reasoning to apply it correctly. They lack the foundational recall.
* **Specific answer:** The answer is very specific. Any deviation (wrong auxiliary verb, wrong past participle, missing "by the wind") would lead to zero marks.
* **Common mistakes:** They would likely just copy the sentence, or change a word randomly, or try to make a simple past tense sentence. They wouldn't grasp the concept of subject-object inversion or the use of "be" + past participle.

**basic: 5% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** A few might grasp the instruction with some explanation, but many would still struggle. They can read the sentence, but the grammatical concept is a hurdle.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They might have a vague idea that the sentence structure needs to change, but the specific rules for passive voice (especially the auxiliary verb and past participle) would be a major challenge.
* **Specific answer:** They might get "The leaves" at the beginning, but then struggle with "were blown" and "by the wind."
* **Common mistakes:**
    * "The leaves blow away by the wind." (Incorrect verb form)
    * "The leaves blew away by the wind." (Keeping the active verb)
    * "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Subject-verb agreement error with "was" instead of "were")
    * Missing "by the wind" entirely.
    * Getting "blown" but not "were."

**competent: 40% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** They would understand the instruction and the original sentence.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would have been introduced to passive voice and would recall the basic structure (object becomes subject, use of 'be' verb, past participle). They would need to reason to identify the correct 'be' verb (were) and the past participle of 'blow' (blown).
* **Specific answer:** This is where they'd be most likely to get it right. They understand the mechanics.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * The most common mistake would be using "was" instead of "were" due to not paying close attention to the plural "leaves."
    * Occasionally, forgetting "by the wind" if they are rushing.
    * A few might struggle with the past participle of irregular verbs like "blow."

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** No issues here.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would have a solid understanding of active and passive voice, including irregular verb forms and subject-verb agreement. They would apply the rules confidently.
* **Specific answer:** They would know the exact structure required.
* **Common mistakes:** A very rare slip-up, perhaps a momentary lapse in concentration leading to a minor error like "was" instead of "were," but generally, they would nail this. The 10% not getting full marks might be due to a silly mistake under pressure or if they are truly advanced in comprehension but less so in rote grammar application.
