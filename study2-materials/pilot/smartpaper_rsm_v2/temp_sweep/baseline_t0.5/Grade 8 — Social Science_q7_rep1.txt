This is a great question that really makes me think about my students! Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They would struggle immensely just to read and comprehend the question itself. "Contribute to the expansion" would be a major hurdle.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** Even if they vaguely remember "Plassey," connecting it to "expansion of British power" and then specifically to "political dominance/control over Bengal" is a complex leap for them.
* **Specificity:** The required answer is quite specific. They might remember "British won" but not the *implications* of that victory in terms of political control or puppet nawabs.
* **Common mistakes:** They'd likely just write "British won" or "Nawab lost," if anything at all. They wouldn't grasp the concept of political dominance.

**basic: 5% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Some might be able to decode the question with effort, but understanding "contribute to the expansion" would still be difficult.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They might recall that the British won Plassey and that it was important, but the precise link to *political dominance over Bengal* and the *puppet nawab* concept is where they'd likely fall short.
* **Specificity:** They might say "British became powerful" or "British got control," but not necessarily link it to Bengal or the political nature of that control as required for full marks. They might miss the "puppet nawab" detail.
* **Common mistakes:** They might give a general answer about British power increasing, but not hit the specific points of political dominance in Bengal or the puppet nawab.

**competent: 50% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Most would be able to read and understand the question reasonably well.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would likely recall the Battle of Plassey and its significance. They would understand that it led to increased British power. The key here is whether they can articulate the *political dominance over Bengal* and the *puppet nawab* aspect. This is where some might still struggle with the precise phrasing.
* **Specificity:** About half of them would be able to articulate that the British gained control over Bengal, perhaps mentioning Mir Jafar as a puppet. The other half might give a slightly less specific answer like "British got control of Bengal" without explicitly stating "political dominance" or "puppet nawab," which might cost them the full mark depending on strictness.
* **Common mistakes:** Some might just say "British got control of Bengal" without the "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" detail, which is crucial for the full mark.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issue here.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would have a strong grasp of the events and their significance. They would understand the cause-and-effect relationship clearly.
* **Specificity:** They would be able to articulate that the victory led to the establishment of British *political dominance/control over Bengal*, and many would specifically mention the installation of Mir Jafar as a *puppet nawab*. They have the vocabulary and conceptual understanding to hit all the required points.
* **Common mistakes:** A very small percentage might miss one specific detail or phrase, perhaps not explicitly using "political dominance" but implying it strongly, which might still be enough depending on the examiner. But generally, they would nail it.
