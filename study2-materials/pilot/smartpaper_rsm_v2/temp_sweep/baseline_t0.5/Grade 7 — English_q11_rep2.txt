This is a tricky question for a Class 7 student, especially given the background of the students. The question asks for an "adjective *phrase*", but the correct answer according to the rubric is "tiny," which is an adjective, not an adjective phrase. This discrepancy will likely confuse many students, even the more advanced ones, if they understand what a phrase is.

Let's break down the likely performance based on the *intended* answer ("tiny") and the *actual* question ("adjective phrase").

**If students interpret "adjective phrase" loosely as "adjective":**

*   **Struggling (35%):** Many will struggle to read and understand the question itself. Even if they identify "bird" as a noun, picking out "tiny" might be difficult. They might pick "its nest," "our balcony," or just random words.
    *   *Likely full marks:* 5% (Perhaps a few lucky guesses or those who have just covered adjectives and remember "tiny" is one).
*   **Basic (35%):** They might recognize "tiny" as a describing word, but the term "adjective phrase" could throw them off. They might try to find more than one word. If they've recently covered adjectives, they might recall it.
    *   *Likely full marks:* 20% (Those who understand "tiny" is an adjective and either ignore "phrase" or guess it's asking for the adjective itself).
*   **Competent (20%):** These students are more likely to know what an adjective is. However, the "phrase" part will be a significant hurdle. They might correctly identify "tiny" as an adjective but then struggle to form a "phrase" around it, or they might incorrectly identify something like "a tiny" or "tiny bird" as the phrase. If they stick to just "tiny," it's because they've decided the question is poorly phrased or they're just giving the adjective.
    *   *Likely full marks:* 40% (Those who correctly identify "tiny" and either ignore "phrase" or assume the question is just asking for the adjective).
*   **Advanced (10%):** These students are most likely to know the difference between an adjective and an adjective *phrase*. They will be confused because "tiny" is an adjective, not a phrase. An adjective phrase modifying "bird" would be something like "very tiny" or "tiny and brown." Since there isn't a clear adjective phrase in the sentence that fits the rubric's answer, they might struggle to give *any* answer, or they might write "tiny" but express confusion. If they give "tiny" and get full marks, it's because they've correctly guessed what the examiner *wants* rather than what the question *asks*.
    *   *Likely full marks:* 30% (Those who, despite knowing the difference, provide "tiny" as the closest answer, hoping for partial credit or guessing the examiner's intent).

**Considering the discrepancy between the question ("adjective phrase") and the rubric's answer ("tiny" - an adjective):**

This is a critical point. If the teacher is strict about "phrase," then "tiny" is incorrect. If the teacher is lenient and accepts "tiny" because it's the descriptive word, then the scores might be higher for those who identify "tiny." Given the context of a government school and the likely focus on basic identification, it's probable that "tiny" would be accepted. My percentages above reflect this leniency, assuming "tiny" is the target answer.

**Revised percentages based on the rubric accepting "tiny" for "adjective phrase":**

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 20% full marks
competent: 40% full marks
advanced: 30% full marks
