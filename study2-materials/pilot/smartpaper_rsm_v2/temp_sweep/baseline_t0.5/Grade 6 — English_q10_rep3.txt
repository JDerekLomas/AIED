This is a classic "some/any" distinction question, which can be tricky for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** Many would struggle to read the sentence fluently, let alone understand the nuance of "some" vs. "any." They might guess randomly or choose "any" because it sounds similar to "many."
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires a specific recall of a grammatical rule (some for affirmative, any for negative/interrogative). They likely haven't internalized this rule.
* **Common mistakes:** Random guessing, choosing "any" because it's a shorter word, or simply not understanding the question.

**basic: 30% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** They can likely read the sentence, but the "some/any" rule might not be firmly established. They might have encountered it but haven't practiced it enough.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They might try to reason it out, but without a strong foundation, they could easily get confused. Some might recall the rule for affirmative sentences.
* **Common mistakes:** Choosing "any" if they associate it with quantity in general, or if they've only seen "any" in questions.

**competent: 70% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** They would read and understand the sentence easily.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would likely recall the rule for "some" in affirmative sentences. They might have practiced this specific distinction before.
* **Common mistakes:** A small percentage might still make a careless error or momentarily confuse the rule, especially if they are under pressure.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** No issue at all.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would immediately identify "some" as the correct word based on the affirmative nature of the sentence. This rule would be well-ingrained.
* **Common mistakes:** Only a very rare, inexplicable slip-up would lead to an incorrect answer.
