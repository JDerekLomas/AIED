Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 6 students in a government school, keeping in mind the specific demographics and ability levels.

The sentence structure "Subject-Verb-Object" is fundamental, but for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the word order can be a significant hurdle. Hindi often has an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure, which can cause confusion. Also, the ability to read and comprehend individual words is crucial before they can rearrange them.

Here's my estimation:

*   **struggling:** 5% full marks
    *   *Reasoning:* Many in this group would struggle to even read all the words correctly. They might recognize "book" and "he" but connecting "reading" and "is" in the correct sequence would be very difficult. They might try to put words together randomly or simply write down the words as given. The concept of a "meaningful sentence" is abstract for them at this stage.
*   **basic:** 30% full marks
    *   *Reasoning:* This group might be able to read most words. They might recognize "he" as a likely start and "book" as a likely end. However, the "is reading" part, especially the auxiliary verb "is" before the main verb, can still be tricky. They might produce "He reading a book is" or "He a book reading is." Some might get it right by trial and error or by remembering similar simple sentences.
*   **competent:** 75% full marks
    *   *Reasoning:* Students in this group generally have a better grasp of basic English sentence structure. They would likely identify "He" as the subject and understand the present continuous tense "is reading." They'd be more attuned to the flow and meaning of the sentence. Some might still make a minor error, perhaps omitting "a" or getting the "is reading" order slightly off if they rush.
*   **advanced:** 95% full marks
    *   *Reasoning:* For advanced students, this is a relatively straightforward task. They would instantly recognize the correct SVO structure and the present continuous tense. The only reason it's not 100% is the possibility of a careless mistake (e.g., missing a word, minor spelling error if they're writing it out) rather than a conceptual misunderstanding.
