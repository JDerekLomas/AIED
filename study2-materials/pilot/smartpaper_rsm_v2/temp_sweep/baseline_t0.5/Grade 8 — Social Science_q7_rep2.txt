This is a great question that really makes me think about my students! Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Most struggling students would not be able to read and comprehend the question itself, let alone formulate an answer in English. Even if they recognized "Battle of Plassey," they'd struggle with "contribute to the expansion of British power."
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires recall of a specific consequence. While we might have covered it, their ability to retrieve and articulate it is very low.
* **Specificity:** The required answer is quite specific (political dominance/control over Bengal, puppet nawab). They might remember "British won," but connecting it to political dominance and Mir Jafar is too much.
* **Common mistakes:** They'd likely write nothing, or just "British won" or "Nawab lost," which wouldn't get them full marks.

**basic: 10% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** A small percentage might be able to read and understand the core of the question ("Battle of Plassey," "British power"). They'd struggle with "contribute to the expansion."
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall that the British gained something significant in Bengal.
* **Specificity:** This is where they'll fall short. They might say "British got more power in Bengal" or "British started ruling Bengal," which is close but might not explicitly mention "political dominance" or "puppet nawab Mir Jafar" to get the full mark. Some might get lucky and remember the puppet nawab.
* **Common mistakes:** "British won and got more land," "Nawab lost and British became strong." They might miss the nuance of *political control* and the *puppet ruler* aspect.

**competent: 60% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Most competent students would understand the question.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would have a good grasp of the Battle of Plassey and its immediate aftermath. They've likely heard about Mir Jafar.
* **Specificity:** Many would be able to articulate that the British gained political control over Bengal, or that they installed a puppet ruler like Mir Jafar. They connect the victory to the direct political consequence.
* **Common mistakes:** Some might just say "British got control of Bengal" without explicitly mentioning "political dominance" or "puppet nawab," which might be borderline for full marks depending on the strictness of the rubric.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issue here.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would easily recall the key details and understand the implications.
* **Specificity:** They would confidently provide an answer that includes political dominance over Bengal and likely mention Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab. They grasp the cause-and-effect relationship clearly.
* **Common mistakes:** A very rare few might forget the specific name "Mir Jafar" but still articulate the concept of a puppet ruler and political control, which would likely still get them full marks.
