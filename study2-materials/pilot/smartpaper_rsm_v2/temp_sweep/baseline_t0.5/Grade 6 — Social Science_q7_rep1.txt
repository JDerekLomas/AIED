Namaste, bachcho! Aaj hum Rajasthan ke baare mein baat karenge.

**Question:** Rajasthan mein paaye jaane wale koi bhi do prakritik sansadhan (natural resources) batao, aur unmein se kisi ek ka logon ke jeevan par kya asar padta hai, samjhao.

**Scoring rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy). Max score: 1

Let's break down how my students would perform:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Many would struggle to even understand the question properly. "Natural resources" (prakritik sansadhan) is a key term, and while I would have taught it in Hindi, recalling the English term and linking it to the question would be hard.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This question requires recall of specific resources *and* then a bit of reasoning/explanation. The recall part itself would be challenging for them.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might list things that aren't natural resources (e.g., 'forts', 'camels') or struggle to name even one. If they name one, explaining its influence would be almost impossible for most. Even if they understand the question, retrieving two *correct* examples and then explaining one is a multi-step process that is tough for this group.

**basic: 30% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They might get the gist of the question with some effort, perhaps needing a quick Hindi translation of "natural resources."
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would likely be able to recall one or two common resources, especially if we've discussed them recently (like water or sand/marble). Explaining the influence might be simple, like "pani se kheti karte hain" (they farm with water), but it might lack detail.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might list one correct resource but struggle to name a second. Or they might name two but struggle to explain the influence clearly. Their explanation might be very basic and not fully elaborate.

**competent: 70% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They would understand the question without much difficulty.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would be able to recall at least two common natural resources like water, marble, or even sunlight (for solar). They would also be able to provide a decent explanation of how one of them influences life, perhaps mentioning agriculture for water, or construction/economy for marble.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might pick less common resources and struggle to explain their influence, or their explanation might be a bit generic rather than specific to Rajasthan.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issues here.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would easily recall two or more correct natural resources, perhaps even less common ones like gypsum or zinc. Their explanation would be clear, concise, and demonstrate a good understanding of the resource's impact on the local economy and lifestyle. They might even give multiple impacts.
*   **Common mistakes:** Very few mistakes. Perhaps a minor error in the specificity of the explanation, but generally, they would nail this.
