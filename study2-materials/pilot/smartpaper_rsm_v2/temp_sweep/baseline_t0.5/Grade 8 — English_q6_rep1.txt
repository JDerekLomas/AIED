This is a great question that makes me think deeply about my students' actual abilities and challenges. Here's my breakdown:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** Many wouldn't even understand "define" or "fable" if they haven't encountered it recently and explicitly. Even if they know the *concept* in Hindi, articulating it in English is a huge hurdle.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall of a specific definition. They might remember a *story* that was a fable, but not the abstract definition.
*   **Specificity:** The rubric requires specific elements ("short story," "animals as characters," "moral lesson"). My struggling students would likely miss one or more of these, especially the "animals as characters" part, even if they grasp the "moral lesson."
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might just name a fable, or say "it's a story with a lesson," missing the animal aspect.

**basic:** 10% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** Some might understand "define" and "fable," especially if we've discussed it recently.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall *parts* of the definition.
*   **Specificity:** This group might get "short story" and "moral lesson," but often forget or omit "animals as characters." They might say "it's a story with a lesson" or "a story that teaches us something."
*   **Common Mistakes:** Missing the animal aspect is common. Their English phrasing might also be awkward or incomplete, preventing a "full marks" score even if they have the core idea. Only a small fraction would manage to articulate all three key components clearly in English.

**competent:** 60% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** They would understand the question clearly.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They are more likely to have memorized or internalized the definition if it was taught.
*   **Specificity:** This group has a good chance of including all three key elements: short story, animals, and moral lesson. They can usually articulate it in reasonably correct English.
*   **Common Mistakes:** A few might still forget the "animals as characters" part, or their phrasing might be slightly off, but the majority would hit the mark.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would almost certainly recall the definition accurately.
*   **Specificity:** They would easily include all required elements and articulate them clearly and correctly in English.
*   **Common Mistakes:** A very rare slip of memory or a slightly less precise word choice might occur, but it would be an exception. They often have a broader vocabulary to express the concept precisely.
