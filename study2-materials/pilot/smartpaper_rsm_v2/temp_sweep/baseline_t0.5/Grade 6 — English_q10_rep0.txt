This is a classic "some/any" distinction, which can be tricky for students with limited exposure to English, especially when they are still translating in their heads.

Here's my breakdown:

**Struggling (35% of students):**
*   **Language barriers:** Many would struggle to read and comprehend the full sentence. They might recognize "apples" and "basket" but the structure and the choice between "some/any" would be lost.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires a specific rule recall (some for affirmative statements, any for negative/questions). They likely haven't internalized this rule yet.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might guess randomly, or pick "any" because it sounds similar to "many" or "anybody" which they might have heard. They might also just pick the first option they see.

**struggling: 5% full marks** (This would likely be a lucky guess, or perhaps one or two who have a slightly better grasp than their peers but are still categorized here).

**Basic (35% of students):**
*   **Language barriers:** They would likely be able to read the sentence, but understanding the nuance of "some" vs. "any" in context would be challenging. They might know individual words but struggle with the grammatical rule.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They might have been introduced to the rule, but it's not solidified. They might try to reason it out, but without strong internalisation, they could easily make a mistake.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might confuse it with questions or negative sentences. They might also just pick the one that "sounds better" to them, which isn't always correct.

**basic: 30% full marks** (Some would recall the rule correctly, especially if it was recently taught. Others might guess correctly or have heard this specific phrase before.)

**Competent (20% of students):**
*   **Language barriers:** They would read and understand the sentence easily.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would likely recall the rule for "some" in affirmative sentences.
*   **Common mistakes:** Very few mistakes here. The main risk would be a momentary lapse or overthinking.

**competent: 85% full marks** (The majority would get this right. The few who miss it might be due to a silly error or momentary confusion.)

**Advanced (10% of students):**
*   **Language barriers:** No issues here.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This would be a straightforward application of a known rule.
*   **Common mistakes:** Extremely unlikely to make a mistake on this.

**advanced: 100% full marks**
