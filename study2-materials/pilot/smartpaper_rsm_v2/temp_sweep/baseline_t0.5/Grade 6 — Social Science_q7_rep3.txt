Okay, let's break this down from the perspective of teaching Class 6 Social Science in a government school in Rajasthan, keeping my students' backgrounds in mind.

First, the question: "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

**Analysis of the question's demands:**

1.  **Recall:** Students need to recall *two* natural resources specific to Rajasthan. This is a factual recall task.
2.  **Understanding/Explanation:** Students need to explain the *influence* of *one* of these resources on people's lives. This requires a bit more than just recall; it needs a basic understanding of cause-and-effect or impact.
3.  **Language:** The question is in English. This is a significant hurdle for many.
4.  **Specificity:** The resources must be *natural* and found in *Rajasthan*. The explanation must link the resource to *people's lives*.

**Common Mistakes My Students Might Make:**

*   **Language:** Misunderstanding "natural resources" or "influences." They might know the Hindi terms (प्राकृतिक संसाधन, प्रभाव) but struggle with the English.
*   **Generic answers:** Naming resources not specific to Rajasthan (e.g., "trees," "animals" without further context).
*   **Listing without explaining:** Just naming two resources and stopping, or naming one and not explaining its influence.
*   **Irrelevant explanation:** Explaining something about the resource that doesn't relate to people's lives (e.g., "Marble is white" instead of "Marble is used for houses and temples, providing work for sculptors").
*   **Focusing on man-made things:** Confusing natural resources with things like "factories" or "roads."
*   **Limited vocabulary:** Even if they understand, expressing the influence clearly in English might be hard.

Now, let's estimate the percentage of students scoring full marks for each group:

*   **Struggling (35% of students):**
    *   **Language barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Many won't even fully grasp the question.
    *   **Recall:** Even if they understand, their knowledge of specific resources might be weak.
    *   **Explanation:** This is a higher-order skill that will be very difficult for them in English.
    *   *Likely outcome:* Many will leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant. A few might name one resource by chance if they recognize a word like "water" or "salt."
    *   **struggling: 0-2% full marks** (This would be an exceptional student in this group who might have picked up a few key terms and managed a very basic explanation).

*   **Basic (35% of students):**
    *   **Language barrier:** They will struggle but might be able to decode parts of the question with some effort or if I've pre-taught key vocabulary.
    *   **Recall:** They might be able to recall one or two common resources like "water" (पानी) or "salt" (नमक) or "marble" (संगमरमर) if we've discussed them.
    *   **Explanation:** Explaining the *influence* will be challenging in English. They might give a very simple, one-word answer or a phrase that doesn't fully explain. For example, "Water is for drinking" is an influence, but a very basic one.
    *   *Likely outcome:* Some might name two resources but fail to explain. Others might name one and give a very rudimentary explanation. Full marks require both parts to be correct and adequately explained.
    *   **basic: 10-15% full marks** (These would be students who can recall two resources and manage a simple, understandable sentence or two about the influence, despite grammatical errors).

*   **Competent (20% of students):**
    *   **Language barrier:** They will understand the question reasonably well, though they might still make grammatical errors in their answer.
    *   **Recall:** They should be able to recall at least two common natural resources of Rajasthan (e.g., water, marble, salt, copper, sand).
    *   **Explanation:** They should be able to explain the influence with a couple of sentences, showing a clear understanding. For example, "Water is scarce in Rajasthan, so people save it and use it for farming and drinking. It affects where they live." or "Marble is used to build houses and temples, and many people work in marble mines and factories."
    *   *Likely outcome:* Most will get the two resources. The explanation will be the differentiating factor. Some might be a bit brief, but generally, they will hit the
