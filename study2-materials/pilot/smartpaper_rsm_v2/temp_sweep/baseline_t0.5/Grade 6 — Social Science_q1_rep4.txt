This is a very common and straightforward recall question for Class 6 Social Science in India. Even with the challenges, I'd expect a decent number to get at least one correct.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 10% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Many struggling students will not be able to read and comprehend "major mountain ranges located in India." They might pick out "India" and "mountain" but struggle with "major" and "ranges."
*   **Recall:** While it's recall, if they haven't grasped the concept in class due to language or other learning difficulties, they won't have it to recall.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might write "Mount Everest" (a peak, not a range), or something completely unrelated, or just leave it blank. Some might recognize "Himalaya" from pictures or general knowledge, but struggle to write it correctly.

**basic: 40% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Many in this group will struggle with the full sentence, but they will likely pick out "mountain" and "India." They will be able to connect it to what they've learned.
*   **Recall:** They would have been taught the major ranges multiple times. "Himalayas" is almost universally known. "Aravalli" or "Vindhya" are also very common.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might write only one range instead of two, or misspell one of them. Some might struggle to recall a second one if they only focused on the most prominent.

**competent: 80% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They will likely understand the question clearly, even if they have some difficulty with English. The core concepts are familiar.
*   **Recall:** This is a core knowledge item. They would have memorized at least 2-3 major ranges.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Minor spelling errors, but they would definitely name two correct ranges.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here. They will comprehend the question perfectly.
*   **Recall:** They will not only recall two but probably 3-4 ranges and be able to write them correctly.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Extremely rare, perhaps a very minor spelling slip, but they would certainly get two correct.
