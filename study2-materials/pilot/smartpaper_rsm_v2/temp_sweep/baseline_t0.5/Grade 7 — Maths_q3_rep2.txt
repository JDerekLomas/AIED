Here's my breakdown based on experience:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** This is a huge hurdle. "Area," "base," "height" are likely new or poorly understood English terms. They might recognize the numbers but not the context.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is primarily recall of a formula. If they haven't memorized it, or understood what the terms mean, they're stuck.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Multiplying base x height directly (ignoring the 1/2).
    *   Getting confused by the numbers and doing random operations (adding, subtracting).
    *   Not knowing what "area" means at all.
    *   Unable to read the question to even attempt it.

**basic:** 40% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** Many might understand "area," "base," "height" if taught in Hindi, but struggle with the English phrasing. They might need help translating the question.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They *might* have memorized the formula, especially if it was recently taught. They're less likely to derive it or understand its conceptual basis.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Forgetting the "1/2" is the most common mistake here. They often just do `8 x 6 = 48`.
    *   Making calculation errors with the 1/2 (e.g., dividing by 2 incorrectly).
    *   Forgetting units or using incorrect units (e.g., cm instead of cm²).

**competent:** 85% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** They generally have a better grasp of English mathematical terms. They might pause but can usually decode the question.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will almost certainly recall the formula. They understand what area represents.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Minor calculation errors are possible.
    *   Forgetting units, though less common than in the basic group.
    *   Very occasionally, a momentary lapse and forgetting the 1/2, but they usually self-correct.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here. They'll understand the question immediately.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will recall the formula instantly and understand its application. They might even mentally check their answer.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Extremely rare calculation error.
    *   Might occasionally forget units, but highly unlikely for full marks.
    *   They are very precise and thorough.
