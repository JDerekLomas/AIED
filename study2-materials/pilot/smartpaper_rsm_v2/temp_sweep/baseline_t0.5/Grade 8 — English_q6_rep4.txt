This is a great question that really makes me think about my students! Here's my breakdown:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Even if they've heard the word "fable," articulating a definition in English is a huge challenge. They might know *of* a fable, but not *what* it is.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is pure recall of a specific definition, which is difficult for them.
*   **Specificity:** The required answer is quite specific. They might say "a story," but miss the animal characters and moral.
*   **Common mistakes:** They would likely struggle to form any coherent sentence in English, or give a very vague answer like "a story."

**basic:** 5% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Some might be able to piece together "short story" or "animals," but connecting all the elements is tough.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They might recall *parts* of the definition if we've explicitly discussed it, but not the whole thing.
*   **Specificity:** They might get one or two elements right (e.g., "story with animals" or "story with a moral"), but rarely all three.
*   **Common mistakes:** Missing either the animal characters or the moral, or struggling with sentence structure.

**competent:** 40% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They would generally understand the question and be able to formulate an answer.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** If we've covered fables in class and discussed their characteristics, a good portion would be able to recall the key elements.
*   **Specificity:** Many would get "short story," "animals," and "moral." Some might miss one of the secondary elements.
*   **Common mistakes:** Forgetting to mention "short story" or perhaps struggling with the exact phrasing of "imparts a moral lesson" and instead saying "teaches something."

**advanced:** 85% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** No issue here.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would likely have a clear understanding and recall of what a fable is, possibly even from prior knowledge or independent reading.
*   **Specificity:** They would be able to articulate all the required elements accurately and concisely.
*   **Common mistakes:** A very small percentage might miss one minor detail or use slightly less precise language, but generally, they would hit all the points.
