This is a great question that really makes me think about my students! Here's my breakdown based on my experience:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Even if they've heard the word 'fable' before, articulating a definition in English, especially with the specific components required (animals, moral lesson), would be almost impossible for them. They struggle with basic sentence construction.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is pure recall of a specific definition. They might recognize a fable if I read it to them, but defining it is a different skill.
*   **Common mistakes:** They wouldn't even attempt a full sentence. They might say "story" or "animal," but not connect the two with the moral.

**basic: 5% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** A few might be able to string together "short story" and "animals," but "moral lesson" is a more complex phrase that many would miss or struggle to articulate. They might say "good thing to learn" or "lesson," but not "moral lesson."
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They might have some fragments of the definition from previous lessons, but putting it all together accurately is tough.
*   **Common mistakes:** Missing "moral lesson," or only providing one part of the definition. Their English sentences would likely be grammatically incorrect even if they got the core ideas.

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Many in this group would have a decent grasp of the key terms. They've likely encountered "fable" and "moral" in previous classes or textbooks.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is within their recall ability if they've been taught it explicitly.
*   **Common mistakes:** Some might miss one of the components (e.g., forget to mention animals explicitly, or just say "lesson" instead of "moral lesson"). Their sentence structure might be a little clunky but generally understandable.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They would have no issue with the language required to define this.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is a standard definition they would be expected to know and recall accurately.
*   **Common mistakes:** A very rare mistake might be a slight misphrasing, but they would almost certainly hit all three key points (short story, animals, moral lesson). The 10% miss might be due to a momentary blank or slight imprecision in wording.
