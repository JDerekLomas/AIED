This is a very common and fundamental question in Class 6 Social Science, especially in Geography. However, considering the specific context of my students, I anticipate the following:

**struggling: 10% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Many will struggle to even read and comprehend the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." The words "major," "mountain ranges," and "located" might be stumbling blocks.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is purely recall. While we would have taught it, their ability to retrieve and articulate it in English is limited.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might recall a single range but not two. They might misspell it so badly it's unrecognizable. Some might name a river or a state instead, showing a lack of understanding of "mountain range."

**basic: 40% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They will likely understand the question, perhaps with a little effort or by recognizing key words like "mountain" and "India."
*   **Recall:** They would have encountered these names multiple times. They might remember one range easily (Himalayas is very prominent) but struggle to recall a second one accurately.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Naming only one range. Spelling errors that might still be decipherable. Naming a range that is *near* India but not strictly *in* India (e.g., a range in Nepal).

**competent: 80% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They will read and understand the question clearly.
*   **Recall:** They would have a good grasp of the major physical features of India. They would likely recall at least two common ranges like the Himalayas, Aravalli, or Vindhya.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Minor spelling errors. Occasionally, they might name a range that is less "major" or slightly outside the core curriculum's focus.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue at all.
*   **Recall:** They would not only recall two but probably three or four major ranges. They would be confident in their answers.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very rare, perhaps a very minor spelling slip, but the answer would be unequivocally correct.
