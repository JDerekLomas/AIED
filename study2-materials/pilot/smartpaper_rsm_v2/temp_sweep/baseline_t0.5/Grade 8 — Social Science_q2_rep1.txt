Okay, this is a classic question and one that we cover in detail. Given the context of my students, here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Key feature," "urban planning," "Harappan Civilization" – these are all big words for them. Even if they know the *concept* in Hindi, translating it to English or understanding the question itself will be very difficult.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall. If they haven't memorized specific English terms, they're stuck.
*   **Specificity:** The answer needs to be quite specific (e.g., "grid pattern," "drainage system"). A vague answer like "they built good cities" won't get full marks.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might write something completely unrelated, or just a few disconnected English words they remember (like "bricks" or "city"). They often struggle to form a coherent sentence in English.

**basic: 30% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They'll understand the gist of the question ("Harappan city planning"). They might struggle with "key feature" but will try to recall something important.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They've likely heard about the drainage system or the grid pattern in class (often explained in Hindi). The challenge is recalling the *English terms*.
*   **Specificity:** Some might recall "drainage system" or "baked bricks" and be able to write it down. Others might write something like "good roads" or "clean cities," which might get partial credit but not full marks.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Often, they'll write a correct term but without enough explanation, or their English sentence structure will be very broken. They might confuse Harappan features with other civilizations if not careful.

**competent: 75% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They will understand the question fully.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will have a good grasp of the key features and the associated English vocabulary.
*   **Specificity:** They can articulate one specific feature clearly, like "The Harappan cities had a well-planned grid layout of streets" or "They had an advanced drainage system."
*   **Common Mistakes:** A few might make minor spelling errors or slightly incomplete sentences, but the core idea will be correct and well-expressed.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will easily recall multiple features and choose the best one to describe.
*   **Specificity:** They will provide a precise and well-articulated answer, often using appropriate vocabulary.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very rare. Perhaps a very minor grammatical slip, but the answer will be unequivocally correct and complete.
