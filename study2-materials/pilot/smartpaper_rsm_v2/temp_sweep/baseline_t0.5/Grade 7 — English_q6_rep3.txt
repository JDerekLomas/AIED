This is a challenging question for my students, especially given the context of a government school in India with diverse English proficiency levels. Here's my breakdown:

**Thinking Process:**

*   **Language Barriers:** "Writing style" itself is a slightly abstract concept. Even if they understand "writing" and "style" individually, combining them might be tricky. Many will struggle to even *read* and comprehend the question fully.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires *reasoning* and *analysis* of a text they've read. It's not a direct recall question like "Who is the poet?" They need to have understood the poem well enough to form an opinion on its style. This is a higher-order thinking skill.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric is quite open ("suitable and relevant word"). This helps, as they don't need to guess a specific word I have in mind. However, they still need to *produce* a word.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Misunderstanding "writing style" – they might describe the *content* of the poem instead (e.g., "The poet writes about nature" instead of "The poet's style is descriptive").
    *   Lack of vocabulary – even if they understand the concept, they might not have the English word to describe it (e.g., they might think "easy to understand" but not be able to say "simple" or "lucid").
    *   Copying lines from the poem instead of analyzing.
    *   Leaving it blank due to lack of confidence.

Here's my estimated breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   They will likely not understand the question at all. Even if they grasp "writing," "style" will be too abstract. They might try to copy something from the poem or write something completely irrelevant.

**basic: 5% full marks**
*   A very small percentage might grasp the question's intent. They might have a very basic understanding of "easy to read" or "about nature." If the poem was exceptionally straightforward, one or two might stumble upon "simple" or "descriptive," but it would be more by chance or if they've been specifically taught about "style" in a very concrete way for that particular poem. Most will struggle with the vocabulary to articulate an appropriate word.

**competent: 40% full marks**
*   These students have a better grasp of English and can generally understand the question. They might have been exposed to the concept of "style" in a basic way. They are more likely to identify a word like "simple," "descriptive," or "easy." Their main challenge might be choosing the *most* appropriate word or articulating it clearly, but many will get a suitable word.

**advanced: 80% full marks**
*   These students will understand the question clearly. They have the vocabulary and analytical skills to describe the poet's style. They might use words like "simple," "descriptive," "evocative," "direct," "informal," "narrative," or "lyrical," depending on the poem. Their answers will be more nuanced and precise. The 20% who don't score full marks might misinterpret the specific poem's style or choose a less fitting word, but most will hit the mark.
