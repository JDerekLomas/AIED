This is a classic sentence rearrangement task, and while it seems straightforward, the nuances of my classroom mean varying success rates.

*   **Language barriers:** Many struggling students will not be able to read all the words, let alone understand their meaning or grammatical function. They might recognize 'book' and 'he' but struggle with 'reading' and 'is'.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires reasoning about sentence structure (SVO - Subject-Verb-Object), which is a fundamental concept. However, for those with very limited exposure, it might feel like a recall of a specific pattern they haven't internalized.
*   **Specificity:** The answer is very specific. Any deviation (e.g., "A book he is reading") would not get full marks.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Putting 'a book' first (e.g., "A book he is reading").
    *   Missing 'is' or putting it in the wrong place.
    *   Getting the order of 'reading' and 'a book' wrong.
    *   Simply copying the words in the given order.
    *   Forgetting capitalization or punctuation (though the rubric doesn't specify, it's a common oversight).

Here's my breakdown:

struggling: 5% full marks (Perhaps a lucky guess, or they've seen this exact sentence before and memorized it.)
basic: 30% full marks (They might grasp the SVO concept but struggle with the specific arrangement or get confused by 'is' and 'reading' together.)
competent: 80% full marks (They generally understand basic sentence structure and can apply it here.)
advanced: 95% full marks (This is a very basic task for them; the only reason for not getting 100% might be a silly mistake or oversight.)
