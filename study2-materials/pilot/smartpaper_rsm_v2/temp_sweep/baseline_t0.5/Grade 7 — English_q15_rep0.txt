This is a very common type of writing task given to Class 7 students, and my experience with the described student demographic helps me predict the outcomes quite well.

Here's my breakdown:

**Struggling (35% of students): 0% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Many in this group would struggle to even read and comprehend the prompt fully. They might pick out keywords like "hobby" but miss "when" and "why."
*   **Writing ability:** Even if they understand, forming 4-5 grammatically correct sentences is a huge challenge. They might write a single, fragmented sentence like "My hobby is play." or "I like cricket."
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** While "favourite hobby" is recall, the "when" and "why" require a bit more structured thought and vocabulary they likely lack.
*   **Common mistakes:** Very short, incomplete sentences, incorrect verb forms, missing prepositions, articles, and basic sentence structure errors. They often write in a very literal, word-for-word translation from Hindi.

**Basic (35% of students): 10% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They would likely understand the prompt with some effort, perhaps needing a teacher to read it aloud or explain a few words.
*   **Writing ability:** They can usually form simple sentences. They might be able to state their hobby, and perhaps one reason or when they do it, but getting all three elements (hobby, when, why) into 4-5 coherent sentences is difficult. They often struggle with sentence connectors and varying sentence structure.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They can recall their hobby and a basic reason. The challenge is articulating it clearly and completely.
*   **Common mistakes:** Short, choppy sentences. Repetitive phrasing. Grammatical errors, especially with tenses and subject-verb agreement. They might write 2-3 sentences but struggle to expand to 4-5 without making significant errors or just repeating themselves. Some might miss one of the required elements (e.g., forget to mention "when").

**Competent (20% of students): 70% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They would understand the prompt without much difficulty.
*   **Writing ability:** They can generally construct grammatically sound sentences and paragraphs. They have enough vocabulary to express their hobby, when they do it, and a couple of reasons why they enjoy it. They might make minor errors, but the overall meaning is clear and the paragraph structure is present.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This task is well within their capabilities.
*   **Common mistakes:** Minor grammatical slips (e.g., a missing 's' on a verb, an article error), slightly awkward phrasing, or perhaps writing 3 sentences instead of 4-5, or vice-versa. However, they would likely include all required elements.

**Advanced (10% of students): 90% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issues at all.
*   **Writing ability:** They would easily meet and likely exceed the requirements. They would write a clear, well-structured paragraph with correct grammar, appropriate vocabulary, and good sentence flow. They might even add a bit more detail or express more nuanced reasons for their enjoyment.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is a straightforward task for them.
*   **Common mistakes:** Very rare. Perhaps a single, very minor grammatical error that doesn't impede understanding. The 10% not getting full marks might be due to a careless error or misinterpreting "4-5 sentences" as "at least 4-5" and writing too much, or conversely, writing just 3 sentences.

**Summary:**

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 10% full marks
competent: 70% full marks
advanced: 90% full marks
