Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 7 English students in a government school, keeping in mind their background and the specific question.

The question "Describes the poet’s writing style" requires students to not just understand the poem, but also to analyze *how* it's written. This moves beyond simple comprehension and into a more analytical skill.

Here's my breakdown:

*   **Language barriers:** The biggest hurdle. Many struggling and basic students might not even understand what "writing style" means, let alone "poet." They might fixate on individual words they know and try to describe the *content* rather than the *style*.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is primarily reasoning, but it's reasoning built upon understanding the text and having a vocabulary to describe literary elements. If they've been explicitly taught terms like "simple," "descriptive," "figurative," etc., and practiced identifying them, it becomes easier. However, often, this isn't a heavily emphasized skill at this level, especially with the focus on basic comprehension.
*   **Specificity:** The rubric is quite open ("suitable and relevant word"). This is helpful, as it doesn't demand a single, precise term. However, the challenge is still producing *any* appropriate term.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Describing the *theme* or *message* of the poem instead of the style (e.g., "The poet writes about nature" instead of "The poet uses descriptive language").
    *   Using very general, non-specific words (e.g., "good," "nice," "beautiful").
    *   Not understanding "style" at all and just rephrasing a line from the poem.
    *   Struggling with the English vocabulary to articulate a style, even if they have an intuitive sense of it.

Here's my estimate:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 5% full marks
competent: 40% full marks
advanced: 75% full marks

**Explanation for each group:**

*   **Struggling (35% of students):** Zero percent. They will likely not understand "writing style" or "poet" in this context. They might point to a word they know or try to describe what the poem is *about*, but not *how* it's written. Their English vocabulary is too limited for this abstract concept.
*   **Basic (35% of students):** A very small percentage. Some might, by chance or through a very basic understanding, pick up on a simple aspect like "simple" or "easy to understand" if the poem is indeed straightforward. However, most will still struggle with the concept of "style" and the vocabulary to express it. They might describe the poem's content rather than its form.
*   **Competent (20% of students):** 40%. These students have a better grasp of English and might have encountered the concept of "writing style" before, perhaps in a simpler context. They might be able to identify "descriptive," "simple," or "direct" if the poem clearly exhibits these traits. They have enough vocabulary to articulate a relevant word.
*   **Advanced (10% of students):** 75%. These students are more likely to understand the question and have the vocabulary to provide a suitable answer. They might even offer more nuanced terms like "evocative," "figurative," or "conversational," depending on the poem. The 25% who don't score full marks might still struggle with the *exact* term or might overthink it, but they would generally be on the right track.
