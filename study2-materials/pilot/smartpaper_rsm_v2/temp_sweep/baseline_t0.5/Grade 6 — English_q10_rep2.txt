This is a classic "some/any" distinction, which is often tricky for learners, especially those from Hindi-medium backgrounds where a direct equivalent for this nuance might not exist or be used differently.

Here's my breakdown:

**Struggling (35% of students):**
* **Language barriers:** Many would struggle to even read the sentence fluently, let alone understand the meaning of "some" and "any." The concept of countable/uncountable nouns and positive/negative sentences (which dictates some/any) is likely beyond them.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires a specific recall of a grammatical rule. Reasoning is difficult without understanding the underlying concepts.
* **Common mistakes:** They might guess randomly, pick "any" because it sounds similar to "many" (which they might associate with quantity), or simply leave it blank. They might also not differentiate between questions and statements.

**struggling: 5% full marks** (This would be mostly lucky guesses or perhaps one or two who have somehow picked up this rule through rote learning, despite their overall struggles.)

**Basic (35% of students):**
* **Language barriers:** They might be able to read the sentence, but the distinction between "some" and "any" for positive statements vs. questions/negatives is often a hurdle. They might have encountered it but not fully internalized it.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** It's a recall item. They might remember seeing examples but struggle to apply the rule consistently.
* **Common mistakes:** They might get confused if they've only learned "any" for questions or negatives and not fully grasped "some" for positive statements. They might also confuse it with "many."

**basic: 30% full marks** (Some would have memorized the rule for positive statements, or it might click for them. Others would still be confused.)

**Competent (20% of students):**
* **Language barriers:** They would read and understand the sentence.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is a direct recall of a common grammatical rule. They would likely have been taught this explicitly and practiced it.
* **Common mistakes:** They might occasionally make a mistake if they're rushing or if they've recently been focusing on questions/negatives with "any," but generally, they should know this.

**competent: 80% full marks** (Most would get this right, having learned and practiced this rule. A few might make a careless error.)

**Advanced (10% of students):**
* **Language barriers:** No issue.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is a fundamental rule they would have mastered.
* **Common mistakes:** Highly unlikely to make a mistake on this.

**advanced: 95% full marks** (They would almost certainly get this right. The 5% accounts for an extremely rare careless error or momentary lapse.)
