This is a great question that really makes me think about my students and their capabilities! Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Why so low?** My struggling students often have significant difficulty reading the poem itself, let alone understanding its nuances. Even if I read it aloud multiple times, recalling a specific line and then articulating *why* they like it in English is a huge hurdle. They might point to a line they remember me emphasizing, but the "why" will likely be a simple "good" or "nice," not a coherent reason. Many will struggle to even pick a line.

**basic: 25% full marks**
*   **Why this percentage?** These students can usually read the poem with some effort, perhaps needing a little help with vocabulary. They might be able to identify a line that resonates with them, possibly because it has a simple image or a word they understand. However, their "why" will often be very basic – "It talks about birds," "It is about nature," or "It is easy to understand." They might struggle to elaborate beyond a very simple reason. Some might just copy a line and say "I like this line."

**competent: 70% full marks**
*   **Why this percentage?** These students generally understand the poem's content and can read it without much difficulty. They are more likely to pick a line that genuinely appeals to them and can articulate a reason, even if it's a simple one. For example, "I like the line 'The little birds sing on every tree' because I like the sound of birds singing" or "I like 'The sun does shine' because it makes me feel happy." They can connect the line to a personal feeling or observation.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Why so high?** These students have a good grasp of English and can comprehend the poem's meaning, including some figurative language if present. They will easily be able to select a line and provide a thoughtful reason, often connecting it to a theme, an emotion, or a personal experience. Their reasons will be more elaborate and demonstrate a deeper understanding. For example, "I like the line 'To welcome in the spring' because it shows new beginnings and hope, just like when we start a new school year." They are also more comfortable expressing themselves in English.
