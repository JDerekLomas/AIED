Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 7 English students in a government school, keeping in mind the specific context.

**Analysis of the Item:** "The wind blew the leaves away."
*   **Concept:** Active to Passive Voice transformation. This is a core grammatical concept taught in Class 6 and 7.
*   **Verb Tense:** Simple Past Tense (blew). This means the passive form will use "was/were" + past participle.
*   **Past Participle:** "blown" (irregular verb, often a point of confusion).
*   **Prepositional Phrase:** "away" – needs to be retained.
*   **Agent:** "by the wind" – optional but usually included for full marks.

**Common Mistakes:**
*   **Incorrect Auxiliary Verb:** Using "is/are" instead of "was/were."
*   **Incorrect Past Participle:** "blowed" (common for irregular verbs), or just "blew."
*   **Missing "by the agent":** While grammatically correct to omit, often expected in exercises.
*   **Word Order Confusion:** Mixing up the subject and object in the passive structure.
*   **Not understanding the meaning:** Especially for struggling students, they might not grasp "blew away" as a single action.
*   **Reading Comprehension:** Struggling students might not even correctly read or understand the active sentence.

**Scoring Rubric:** "The leaves were blown away by the wind."

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   These students will likely struggle with reading the sentence itself.
*   They won't understand the concept of voice transformation.
*   They will definitely not know the past participle "blown."
*   They might produce something like "Wind blow the leaves" or just repeat the sentence.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   A small percentage might have memorized the basic rule for simple past tense passive voice (was/were + V3).
*   However, the irregular verb "blew" -> "blown" will be a major stumbling block for most. Many will write "blowed" or keep "blew."
*   They might get the subject/object swap right and use "were" but fail on the participle.
*   The "away" part might also be misplaced or dropped.

**competent: 60% full marks**
*   These students generally understand the concept of active/passive voice.
*   They will know to use "were" for "leaves."
*   The main challenge for them will be recalling the correct past participle "blown." Many will get it right, but a significant portion might still make the "blowed" error or hesitate.
*   They will likely include "by the wind."

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   These students will have a solid grasp of grammar rules and irregular verbs.
*   They will confidently identify the tense and the correct past participle.
*   They will correctly transform the sentence and include all necessary elements.
*   The only reason it's not 100% is the occasional careless error, a momentary lapse in recalling an irregular verb, or misplacing "away."
