This is a great question that makes me think about my students! Here's my breakdown:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Even if they've heard the word "fable," articulating a definition in English is a huge challenge. They might pick up on "story" or "animals" but struggle with "moral" or "imparts."
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is pure recall of a specific definition, which is difficult for them.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might just say "story" or "animal story," but miss the crucial "moral lesson" part. Many wouldn't even attempt to write anything coherent.

**basic:** 10% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Some might have a vague idea but struggle to put it into a complete sentence or use the precise vocabulary.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They might recall parts of the definition (animal characters, story) but often miss the "moral lesson" or struggle to phrase it correctly.
*   **Common mistakes:** "It's an animal story." "Animals talk in it." "It teaches us something." They might get two out of three key elements, but rarely all three articulated clearly. The 10% would be those who have a slightly stronger grasp of English vocabulary and have paid close attention when we discussed fables.

**competent:** 60% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They generally understand the question and can formulate a reasonable answer.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would have been exposed to fables and their definition. They can recall the key elements.
*   **Common mistakes:** Some might miss "short story" or "typically," but most would get "animals as characters" and "moral lesson." They might say "story with animals that teaches a lesson." The 40% who don't get full marks might miss a specific element of the definition or struggle with precise phrasing.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Not an issue for them.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would have internalized this definition and can recall it accurately.
*   **Common mistakes:** The 5% who might not get full marks could be due to a momentary lapse in memory or a slight imprecision in wording (e.g., "story with animals that teaches a lesson" instead of "short story...imparts a moral lesson"). They are generally capable of providing the precise definition.
