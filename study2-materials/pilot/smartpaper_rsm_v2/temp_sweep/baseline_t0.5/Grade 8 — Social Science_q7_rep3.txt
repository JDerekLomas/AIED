Okay, let's break this down based on my experience in a Class 8 Social Science classroom in a government school, keeping in mind the student profile.

The question: "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"
Scoring rubric: For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab). Max score: 1

**Analysis:**

*   **Language barriers:** This is a significant hurdle. "Contribute to the expansion," "political dominance," "puppet nawab" are all relatively complex English phrases. Many students will struggle to even understand the question fully, let alone formulate an answer in English. They might understand the *concept* in Hindi, but expressing it is another matter.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** It primarily requires recall of a specific consequence of the Battle of Plassey. While there's a slight element of understanding "how" it contributed (reasoning), the core is remembering the outcome.
*   **Specificity:** The required answer is quite specific – "political dominance/control over Bengal" and ideally mentioning the puppet nawab. A general answer like "British became powerful" might not get full marks.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Misunderstanding the question:** Students might just write facts about the battle itself (who fought, when) without linking it to British power expansion.
    *   **Vague answers:** "British became strong," "They won the war," "They got money." These don't hit the "political dominance over Bengal" mark.
    *   **Language issues:** Even if they know the answer in Hindi, translating it accurately and concisely into English is tough. They might use incorrect grammar or vocabulary.
    *   **Focusing on economic aspects:** Some might recall the *diwani* rights later and confuse it, or focus on the wealth gained, without explicitly stating political control.

**Percentage of students scoring full marks:**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   These students often have very limited English comprehension and writing skills. They might recognize "Battle of Plassey" and "British power" but struggle to connect them meaningfully. They're more likely to write something completely off-topic, or just "British won."
    *   **0% full marks.** (Maybe 1-2% might accidentally stumble upon a keyword, but it's highly unlikely they'd articulate the specific political dominance).
*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   These students can usually read simple sentences but struggle with complex vocabulary and sentence structures. They might understand the gist of the question in their minds (in Hindi) but will find it hard to express the specific political outcome in English. They might say "British became powerful in Bengal" or "They controlled Bengal," which is close but might miss the "political dominance" nuance or the "puppet nawab" example.
    *   **5% full marks.** (A few might manage a concise, albeit slightly simplified, answer that hits the core idea of control over Bengal).
*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   These students have a better grasp of English and can recall information more effectively. They would likely understand the question and know that Plassey led to British control over Bengal. They might use phrases like "British gained control of Bengal" or "Mir Jafar became their puppet." They are more likely to articulate the political aspect.
    *   **40% full marks.** (They have the knowledge and the language skills to express it. Some might still be slightly vague or miss the "puppet" example, but a good portion would get it).
*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   These students are strong in both content and language. They would understand the nuances of "political dominance" and would likely include the "puppet nawab" example, articulating it clearly and concisely in good English.
    *   **80% full marks.** (Even among advanced students, there can be minor slips in recall or expression, but the vast majority would nail this).
