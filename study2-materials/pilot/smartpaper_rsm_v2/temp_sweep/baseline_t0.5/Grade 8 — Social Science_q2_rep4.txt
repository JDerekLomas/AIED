Alright, let's break this down from the perspective of teaching Class 8 Social Science in a government school, especially with our students' diverse needs.

The question is: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

This question requires recall of specific information taught in class. The language is relatively straightforward English, but for many of our students, even simple English can be a hurdle, especially if they are primarily thinking in Hindi. The key features are quite distinct and usually emphasized during teaching.

Here's my breakdown:

**Struggling (35% of students):**
*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Many will struggle to even understand "key feature" or "urban planning" in English, even if they know the Hindi equivalents (मुख्य विशेषता, शहरी योजना). They might recognize "Harappan Civilization" but then get lost.
*   **Recall:** Even if they understand the question, their recall of specific details might be weak. They might remember "Harappa" but not specific features.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might write something vague like "they had cities" or "they were good builders," which isn't specific enough for full marks. Some might just copy a word from the question.
*   **Full Marks:** Very low. They might have heard it, but articulating it correctly in English is a big ask.
    **struggling: 5% full marks**

**Basic (35% of students):**
*   **Language Barrier:** They will likely grasp the general meaning of the question, perhaps with some effort or by recognizing keywords. They might translate it mentally.
*   **Recall:** They would have some memory of the lessons. They might remember "streets" or "drains" or "bricks." The challenge is combining these into a coherent, correct answer.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might write "good streets" instead of "grid pattern of streets," or "they had drains" instead of "advanced drainage system." They might miss the "well-planned" aspect. They might also confuse Harappan features with features of other ancient civilizations if not careful.
*   **Full Marks:** Some will get it right, especially if they remember a specific phrase taught in class. Others will be close but lack the precision for full marks.
    **basic: 30% full marks**

**Competent (20% of students):**
*   **Language Barrier:** They will understand the question clearly.
*   **Recall:** They generally have good recall of key facts and concepts. They would have paid attention during the lessons and might have revised.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might sometimes give a slightly less detailed answer than ideal, but it would still be correct. For example, "grid pattern streets" instead of "well-planned grid pattern of streets." But it would still meet the criteria.
*   **Full Marks:** Most of them should be able to articulate one key feature accurately.
    **competent: 80% full marks**

**Advanced (10% of students):**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here.
*   **Recall:** Excellent recall. They often remember multiple features and can choose the most prominent one.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very few, if any, on this type of question. They might even elaborate slightly, which isn't required but shows their understanding.
*   **Full Marks:** Almost all of them will score full marks.
    **advanced: 95% full marks**
