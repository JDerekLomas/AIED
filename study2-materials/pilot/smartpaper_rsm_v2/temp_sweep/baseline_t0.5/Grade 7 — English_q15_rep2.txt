Okay, let's break this down based on my experience in a Class 7 English classroom in a government school, keeping in mind the specific student profile.

Here's the paragraph prompt again:
"Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."
Scoring rubric: Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable.
Max score: 1

Now, for the percentage of students scoring full marks:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** These students often struggle to even read and comprehend the prompt fully. "Paragraph," "favourite," "hobby," "mention," "enjoy" are all potentially difficult words. They might pick out "hobby" and write a single word or a very fragmented sentence.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** While "My Favourite Hobby" is recall-based, structuring it into a paragraph with specific details (when, why) requires understanding sentence structure and sequencing, which is a major hurdle.
*   **Specificity:** The requirement of *when* and *why* is too specific for them. They might state a hobby but fail to elaborate.
*   **Common mistakes:** Single words, incomplete sentences, writing in Hindi, copying parts of the prompt, inability to form a coherent thought in English.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Many can read the prompt with some difficulty, perhaps needing clarification on "paragraph" or "mention." They understand the core idea of "favourite hobby."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall their hobby and might be able to state *when* they do it (e.g., "in evening"). The "why" is harder.
*   **Specificity:** They might manage to include the hobby and *when* they do it, but struggle to articulate *why* they enjoy it in a clear sentence. Their "paragraph" might be 2-3 simple sentences, not necessarily flowing well.
*   **Common mistakes:** Short, choppy sentences; grammatical errors (tense, subject-verb agreement); difficulty connecting ideas; "why" often missing or very simplistic ("I like it"). A few might manage to hit all three points with very basic sentences.

**competent: 60% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They can read and understand the prompt clearly.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can easily recall their hobby and articulate *when* and *why*. They have a basic grasp of sentence structure.
*   **Specificity:** They will generally attempt to include all three required elements. Their paragraph might be 3-4 sentences, grammatically acceptable though perhaps not very sophisticated.
*   **Common mistakes:** Minor grammatical errors (e.g., "I like to reading books" instead of "I like to read books"); sentences might be a bit repetitive; sometimes the "why" is a bit generic. However, they will largely fulfill the rubric's requirements.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issues with understanding the prompt.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can easily structure their thoughts into a coherent paragraph, incorporating all elements smoothly.
*   **Specificity:** They will not only include the hobby, when, and why, but might also add an extra detail or two, making it a well-rounded 4-5 sentence paragraph. Their sentences will be grammatically sound and varied.
*   **Common mistakes:** Very rare, perhaps a single minor spelling error or a slightly awkward phrasing, but the overall content and structure will be excellent and meet all criteria.
