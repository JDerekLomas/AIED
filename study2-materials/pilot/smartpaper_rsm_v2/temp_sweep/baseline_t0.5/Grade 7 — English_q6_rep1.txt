Here's my breakdown based on my experience with Class 7 English students in a government school, considering the given demographics and challenges:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** These students will struggle to even understand the question "Describes the poet's writing style." The words "describes," "poet's," and "writing style" are likely beyond their current vocabulary.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** This question requires a degree of reasoning and analytical thinking about the text, which is a significant hurdle for them. They might be able to identify a word if given options, but generating one independently is highly improbable.
* **Common mistakes:** They would likely leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant if they attempt it at all.

**basic: 5% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** Some might grasp parts of the question, especially if "writing style" has been explicitly discussed in class with simple examples. However, "describes" might still be a challenge.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They might recall a very common descriptive word like "simple" if the poem was indeed very straightforward and this point was heavily emphasized during teaching. However, it's more likely they'd struggle to connect a suitable word to the concept of "writing style."
* **Common mistakes:** They might provide a word describing the *poem's content* rather than the *style* (e.g., "sad," "happy"). They might also just repeat a word from the poem itself.

**competent: 40% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** These students will generally understand the question. They have a decent grasp of English vocabulary and sentence structure.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They can engage in some basic reasoning. If the poem's style was simple and direct, and this was discussed, they might be able to recall or deduce a word like "simple" or "direct." "Descriptive" is also a possibility if the poem had vivid imagery.
* **Common mistakes:** Some might still struggle to find the *most appropriate* word, or they might offer a word that is *partially* correct but not the best fit. They might also give a phrase instead of a single word, or a word that describes the *tone* rather than the *style*.

**advanced: 80% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** No issues here. They will understand the question perfectly.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They are capable of both recall (if the style was explicitly taught) and reasoning (analyzing the poem to identify characteristics of its style). They have a broader vocabulary to choose from.
* **Common mistakes:** Even advanced students can sometimes overthink or choose a more complex word that isn't the *most* fitting for the poem's actual style, or they might miss a very obvious characteristic. However, the probability of them identifying *a* suitable and relevant word is very high. They might offer "simple," "descriptive," "narrative," "informal," "direct," "conversational," etc., depending on the poem.
