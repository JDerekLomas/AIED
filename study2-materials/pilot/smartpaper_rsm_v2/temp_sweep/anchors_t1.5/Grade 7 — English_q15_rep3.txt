REASONING: This item is similar in structure to "My favorite season" (30% pass rate) but requires fewer lines (4-5 vs 6-8), potentially making it slightly less demanding in terms of quantity. However, 'hobby' might be a slightly more abstract concept for some students than 'season', requiring a bit more thought. It is significantly easier than the poetry theme or historical sources questions due to its personal and narrative nature.
