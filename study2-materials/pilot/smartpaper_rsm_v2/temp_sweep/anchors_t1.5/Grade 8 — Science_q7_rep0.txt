REASONING: This question requires students to recall knowledge about decomposition, explain the 'why' (reasoning), and then evaluate its benefits, making it multi-faceted. It's more complex than simply listing facts or extracting information, similar to the "Last Bargain" theme question in requiring deeper understanding, but the topic (decomposition) is more directly from their science syllabus and less abstract than poetry. The difficulty in constructing a coherent explanation and evaluating the benefit will likely keep the pass rate low, comparable to the "differentiate sources" question.
