REASONING: This question is a direct recall from a story, likely a textbook passage, requiring a single, specific answer. It is significantly easier than inferring a theme, differentiating complex historical sources, or writing a multi-line paragraph, and even simpler than listing fundamental rights which require factual knowledge beyond a specific story context. It is most comparable in direct recall difficulty to "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?", but likely easier as it's a simpler character identification.
