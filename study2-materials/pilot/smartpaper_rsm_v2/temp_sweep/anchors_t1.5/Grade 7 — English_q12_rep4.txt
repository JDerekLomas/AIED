REASONING: This question is about a specific grammatical transformation. While it requires understanding the concept of active/passive voice, the sentence is relatively straightforward. Compared to the 'Theme of poem' and 'Archaeological vs Literary sources' questions, which demand deeper analytical thinking or detailed factual recall, this is a more direct application of a learned grammar rule. However, it's slightly harder than recalling 'Fundamental Rights' or directly copying 'King's questions' as it requires transformation, not just recall. It's comparable to 'My Favorite Season' in that it requires some constructive application of learned knowledge. Given the common difficulty students have with grammar transformations, especially maintaining the correct tense and past participle, it will likely be in the middle range.
