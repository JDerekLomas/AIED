REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" question in terms of recall and specificity, as both require naming two specific examples. However, geographical names might be slightly less abstract than legal rights for some students. Given the higher pass rates for recall-based questions with two specific items, I expect this to perform similarly to, if not slightly better than, the Fundamental Rights question, especially since students are only expected to name one for full marks (0.5).
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
