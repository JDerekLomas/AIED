REASONING: This question is complex, requiring both observation, recall of scientific processes (decomposition), and evaluation of benefits. The "change after some days" part is relatively straightforward (decomposition), but explaining *why* and then *evaluating* its benefit for soil health moves it beyond simple recall. The vocabulary and conceptual understanding required are similar to or slightly more demanding than the literary source differentiation, which also asks for both definition and example. Given the low pass rates on questions requiring explanations and critical thinking beyond simple recall, this item will likely be quite difficult.
