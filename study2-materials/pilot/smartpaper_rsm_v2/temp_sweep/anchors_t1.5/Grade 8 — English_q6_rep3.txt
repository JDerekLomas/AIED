REASONING: This question requires recalling a specific definition, similar to the "Fundamental Rights" question but potentially slightly more complex in its required elements. However, "fable" is a core literary term for Class 8, and the answer is less susceptible to misremembering specific terms compared to, for example, two distinct fundamental rights. It's significantly easier than the "Last Bargain" theme question which requires deep comprehension and articulation.
