REASONING: This item involves a basic algebraic equation that requires transposing a number across the equals sign and performing a simple subtraction. While it's a fundamental concept taught in Class 8, the previous math anchor items are not available to provide specific calibration. However, based on the low pass rates for English and Social Science questions requiring abstract thought, written responses, or recalling multiple facts, this direct calculation problem should be significantly easier. The primary challenge would be understanding negative numbers. I anticipate it will be significantly easier than the anchor items provided due to its direct computational nature, but some students may make errors with negative integers.
