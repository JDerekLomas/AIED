REASONING: This item tests a fundamental grammatical concept. While identifying "tiny" as a single adjective might be straightforward for many, the term "adjective phrase" could confuse students who haven't fully grasped the difference between a single adjective and a phrase. Given the difficulty students had with identifying themes and historical sources, I expect some struggle with precise grammatical terminology, although it's simpler than writing a paragraph or recalling abstract rights.
