REASONING: This question requires students to understand the king's questions from the passage (50% pass rate anchor) and then connect them to their own life experience, providing a simple reason. The "one reason" aspect is less demanding than differentiating between historical sources (15% anchor) or interpreting a poem's theme (5% anchor), and more aligned with expressing personal preference like "My favorite season" (30% anchor). It's also less about memorization than fundamental rights (66% anchor), and requires more than just copying from a text, but the connection to "real life" and a simple reason makes it more accessible than the more abstract anchors.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
