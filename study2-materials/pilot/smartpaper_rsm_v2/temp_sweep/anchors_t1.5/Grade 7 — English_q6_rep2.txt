REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the Fundamental Rights question (66% pass rate) because it asks for recall of a single fact or suitable word, which many students would have memorized or picked up during lessons. It is harder than the "What were the three questions..." question, as it requires students to synthesize an understanding of 'writing style' and connect it to a specific poem, rather than directly extracting information from a text.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
