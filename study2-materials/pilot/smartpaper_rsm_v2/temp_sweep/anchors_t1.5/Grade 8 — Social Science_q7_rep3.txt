REASONING: This question requires students to recall specific historical facts and then explain their significance, which is a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall. While it asks for a specific event, connecting it to a broader consequence (expansion of British power) makes it harder than naming fundamental rights or simple differentiation, but easier than understanding the nuanced theme of a poem or writing a coherent paragraph with multiple criteria.
