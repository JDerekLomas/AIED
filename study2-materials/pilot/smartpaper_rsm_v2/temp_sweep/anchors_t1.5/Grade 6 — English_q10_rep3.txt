REASONING: This item tests basic grammar knowledge of determiners ('some'/'any') in a simple affirmative sentence, which is typically taught and reinforced early in Class 6 English. It is significantly easier than the anchor items as it requires only recall and selection, unlike the 'Last Bargain' question which requires abstract thematic understanding, or the history differentiation which demands recall of specific definitions and examples, or even the 'favorite season' paragraph which involves sentence construction and descriptive writing. It is comparable to the 'Fundamental Rights' question in terms of requiring recall of specific facts, but the grammatical concept is likely more frequently encountered and drilled in early English lessons.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
