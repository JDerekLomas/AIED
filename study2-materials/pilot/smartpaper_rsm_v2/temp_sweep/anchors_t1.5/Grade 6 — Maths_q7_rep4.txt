REASONING: This item involves basic arithmetic operations (subtraction and multiplication) and a simple understanding of time. It's similar in cognitive demand to the "Fundamental Rights" question but requires slightly more processing than just recall. Students might struggle with calculating the elapsed time accurately, or performing the multiplication, similar to how they struggled with specific examples in the "Archaeological/Literary sources" question. However, the calculation is straightforward, unlike the abstract theme interpretation of the "Last Bargain" or detailed paragraph writing. It's definitely harder than just copying text for the "Three questions" but easier than nuanced writing or complex historical definitions.
