REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" anchor in terms of direct recall and knowledge application, but the subject matter (geography vs. civics) might be slightly less abstract for Class 6 students, making it potentially slightly easier. However, the requirement to name *two* can reduce the pass rate compared to simply naming *one*.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
