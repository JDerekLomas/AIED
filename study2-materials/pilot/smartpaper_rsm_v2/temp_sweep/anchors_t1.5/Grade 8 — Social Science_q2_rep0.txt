REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) as it requires recalling a specific fact, but it's slightly harder than simply naming. It's much easier than the "Archaeological/Literary sources" (15%) question, which requires differentiation, or the "Last Bargain" (5%) question, which requires abstract thought. It is similar in difficulty to "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%) but without the possibility of directly copying from a passage, increasing the difficulty. It does not require extended writing like "My favorite season" (30%).
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
