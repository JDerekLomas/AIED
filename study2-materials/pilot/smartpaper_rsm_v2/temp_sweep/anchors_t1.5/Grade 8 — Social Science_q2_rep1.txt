REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) as it requires recalling a specific fact, but it is slightly harder as it asks for a "description" rather than just a "name," which can lead to vaguer answers. However, it's easier than the "archaeological sources" anchor (15% pass rate) because "urban planning" for Harappan civilization is a very commonly emphasized topic, making it more recallable than differentiating abstract historical sources.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
