REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%) and "Three questions the king wanted" (50%) in that it requires recalling factual information that should have been taught directly. It is slightly harder than the Fundamental Rights question because it requires a specific regional context (Rajasthan) and then a brief description, making it a two-part answer. However, the occupations are fundamental to understanding rural life and likely discussed often.
