REASONING: This question is similar to the Fundamental Rights anchor item (66% pass rate) as it requires recalling specific factual information taught in Social Science. While the Fundamental Rights are arguably more abstract, the major mountain ranges are prominent geographical features that are repeatedly mentioned and shown on maps in Class 6. This makes it slightly easier than the Fundamental Rights question, as the names are often reinforced visually.
