REASONING: This question is comparable to the 50% pass rate anchor question, "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?", as it requires recall of a specific fact from the textbook. It's harder than simply naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate) because it requires description rather than just naming. However, it's easier than differentiating between sources or identifying a poem's theme, which demand deeper understanding or analytical skills. Students often find rote recall of social science facts challenging, but a single key feature is more manageable than complex differentiation or abstract themes.
