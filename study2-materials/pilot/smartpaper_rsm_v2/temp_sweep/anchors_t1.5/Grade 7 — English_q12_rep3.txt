REASONING: This item is likely to be harder than the 50% pass rate anchor because understanding and applying the rules for active to passive voice transformation often requires a deeper grammatical understanding than simply recalling information from a passage. However, it is likely easier than the 5% and 15% anchors, as it deals with a specific grammatical rule rather than abstract literary themes or complex historical source differentiation. It's comparable to the 30% anchor in that it requires productive writing but with a stricter grammatical constraint.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
