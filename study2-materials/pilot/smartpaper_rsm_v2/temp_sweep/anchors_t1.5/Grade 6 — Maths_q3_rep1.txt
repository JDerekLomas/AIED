REASONING: This question involves basic number ordering, a concept typically introduced and practiced extensively in primary school, and therefore expected to be familiar to most Class 6 students. While some may struggle with transcription or minor errors, the core task is fundamental mathematics. It is comparable to the 50% pass rate item ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?") in that it requires recalling or applying a basic, well-taught skill. However, the exact pass rate will be moderated by potential transcription issues or the difficulty some students might face in writing out all four numbers in the correct order, especially if they are only partially correct. Given the simplicity and fundamental nature of the task compared to complex comprehension (poetry theme) or descriptive writing, it should have a relatively high pass rate among math items.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
