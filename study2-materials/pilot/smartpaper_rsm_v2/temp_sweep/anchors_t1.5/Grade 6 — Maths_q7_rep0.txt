REASONING: This item involves basic arithmetic and time calculation, which is generally covered and practiced extensively in Class 6. The language is straightforward and the numbers are simple. Compared to the English and Social Science anchors, which often require understanding nuanced concepts or writing extended responses, this math problem is much more direct. Students struggle with abstract concepts and extended writing (as seen in the low pass rates for theme and differentiation questions), but usually perform better on concrete calculations. The "Fundamental Rights" anchor, which had a 66% pass rate, also asked for direct recall of taught facts, similar to the direct calculation here.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 65%
