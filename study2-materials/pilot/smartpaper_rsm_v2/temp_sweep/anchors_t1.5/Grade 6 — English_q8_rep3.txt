REASONING: This item is significantly easier than the anchor items. It tests basic sentence structure which Class 6 students should have encountered multiple times, unlike the abstract theme identification, detailed historical differentiation, or even paragraph writing, and it requires less recall than the Fundamental Rights question. The difficulty is comparable to directly extracting information from a passage like "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" but without the potential distraction of a longer text.
