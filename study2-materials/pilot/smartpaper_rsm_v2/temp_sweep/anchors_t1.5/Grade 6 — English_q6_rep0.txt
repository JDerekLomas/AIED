REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "My Favorite Season" prompt (30% pass rate) as it requires students to access information from a text, select a personal preference, and provide a simple justification. However, since they only need to pick one line and give a reason, it might be slightly easier than the paragraph writing. It's harder than simply recalling facts, but easier than understanding abstract themes.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
