REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" question in terms of recalling a specific piece of information, but it requires subjective interpretation rather than rote memorization. It's likely harder than simply identifying names or facts. It asks students to analyze and describe, which is a higher-order skill for this age group, but is still a single word answer for a full score.
