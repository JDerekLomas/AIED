REASONING: This question is comparable to the 50% pass rate anchor item as it requires factual recall from the textbook (similar to "The Three Questions") but also a short explanation (similar to "My Favorite Season"). The expectation is relatively low, only two resources and a brief explanation for one.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
