REASONING: This question is slightly harder than the 50% anchor because it requires inferential thinking and opinion, not just recalling explicit information from the passage. However, it is easier than the 30% anchor as it only asks for one reason, and the "real life" connection might make it more relatable. The core of the answer is still drawn from understanding the king's questions, which was achieved by 50% of students in a previous question.
