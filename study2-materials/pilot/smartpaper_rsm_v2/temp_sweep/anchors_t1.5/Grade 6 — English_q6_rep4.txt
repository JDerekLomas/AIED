REASONING: This question is similar to the 50% pass rate item (What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?) as it asks for information directly from a familiar text (poem vs. reading passage). However, it's slightly harder than recalling specific details from a passage because it requires a subjective choice and a brief justification, which introduces a small creative writing element.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
