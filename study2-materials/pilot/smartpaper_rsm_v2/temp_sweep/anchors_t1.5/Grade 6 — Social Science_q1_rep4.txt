REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" question in terms of recall and specificity, as both require students to recall specific names from their Social Science curriculum. However, naming mountain ranges might be slightly easier as geographical features are often reinforced visually and through maps, potentially making recall more accessible than abstract legal rights. It's similar in difficulty to the '3 questions the king wanted to answer' item, as it requires direct recall of factual information, but is simpler as it doesn't require comprehending a passage.
