REASONING: This question is a direct application of a fundamental formula, much like naming fundamental rights, but it requires a calculation rather than recall of a definition or fact. However, the calculation is very simple and only involves multiplication and division by two. I anticipate a higher success rate than the "Fundamental Rights" question as this is a core concept taught in mathematics, and there's less ambiguity in the answer compared to explaining concepts in English or History.
