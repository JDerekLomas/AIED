REASONING: This question is comparable to the 50% pass rate anchor because it requires recall of specific facts and a basic understanding of cause and effect, which Class 6 students often struggle with when asked to explain rather than just list. However, "natural resources" is a core concept that should have been taught, making it slightly more accessible than some deeper analytical questions. The requirement to "explain how one influences lives" is the main challenge, similar to "why you like it" in the favorite season question (30% pass rate).
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
