REASONING: This question is a direct recall from a story that is likely simple and memorable for Class 6 students. It is significantly easier than inferring a poem's theme, differentiating historical sources, or even generating a paragraph on a personal topic, which requires more cognitive effort and linguistic production. It's comparable to the Fundamental Rights question in terms of recall, but perhaps slightly easier as it refers to a narrative detail rather than constitutional knowledge.
