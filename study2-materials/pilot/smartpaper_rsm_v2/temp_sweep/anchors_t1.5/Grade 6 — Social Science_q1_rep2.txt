REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" question. Both require recall of two specific factual items from memory, which students often struggle with, but the information is directly taught in textbooks. The fact that only one correct answer is needed for 0.5 points makes it slightly more achievable.
