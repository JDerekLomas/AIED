REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" question in terms of requiring recall of a specific factual detail from the textbook. While the concept might be slightly more complex than naming a right, the request for only *one* feature makes it less demanding than explaining a full differentiation or a central idea.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
