REASONING: This question is comparable to the 66% pass rate anchor item on Fundamental Rights as it asks for specific factual recall and then a simple application or explanation for one of them. While the application adds a slight layer of complexity, the fact that students only need to explain *one* of the two mentioned resources, and common resources like water and sunlight have very clear impacts on life, makes it approachable.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
