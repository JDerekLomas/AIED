REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" question as it requires recall of a specific term/concept. However, it's slightly harder as "writing style" is a more abstract concept for Class 7 students, and they might struggle to find suitable descriptive words beyond basic ones, unlike recalling concrete rights.
