REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "Favorite Season" item (30%) but perhaps slightly harder as it requires quoting a specific line AND justifying it. Students might struggle with selecting a specific line or articulating their reason clearly. It's much easier than the "Theme" or "Archaeological Sources" questions, as it doesn't require deep conceptual understanding or factual recall, but rather personal preference and basic comprehension.
