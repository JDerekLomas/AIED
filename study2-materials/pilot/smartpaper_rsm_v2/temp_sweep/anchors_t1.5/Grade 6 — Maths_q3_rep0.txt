REASONING: This item involves a basic concept of number comparison and ordering, typically taught and reinforced from primary grades. It is purely computational and does not require understanding of abstract concepts, vocabulary, or paragraph writing, making it much easier than the "theme of a poem" or "differentiate historical sources" questions. It's comparable to or slightly easier than the Fundamental Rights question because it requires even less recall and primarily focuses on a single mathematical skill. The pass rate is also helped by the partial credit in the rubric.
