REASONING: This question is a direct application of a basic geometric formula that is usually taught and practiced extensively in Class 7 mathematics. While students in our context struggle with open-ended or analytical questions (like the poem theme or differentiating sources), straightforward recall and application problems tend to have higher pass rates, especially if the numbers are simple. Compared to the 'Fundamental Rights' question which requires memorization, this problem allows for a simple calculation that even students with partial understanding of the formula can attempt. However, some students might confuse it with the area of a rectangle or forget the 1/2 factor, pulling the rate down from a perfect score.
