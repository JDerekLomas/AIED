REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to naming Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate) as it requires recalling specific facts related to social studies but is slightly harder as it requires naming two occupations and then briefly describing one, making it a two-part answer. It is easier than the Three Questions (50%) and all lower anchor items because the information is likely directly taught and easily recalled from lessons on Rajasthan geography/economy.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
