REASONING: This question is harder than "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%) because it requires understanding a specific grammatical term, "adjective phrase," which is a relatively abstract concept. While "tiny" is an adjective, students may confuse "adjective phrase" with just "adjective" or struggle to identify it in context. It's similar in cognitive load to identifying a theme or differentiating historical sources but focuses on a more niche grammatical concept that many students in this setting might not have mastered.
