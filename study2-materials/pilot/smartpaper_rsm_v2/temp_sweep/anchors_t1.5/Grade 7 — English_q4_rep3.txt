REASONING: This question is slightly harder than the 50% anchor because it requires inferential thinking and a personal opinion rather than direct recall from the text. While it relates to the 50% anchor, the additional 'why' component adds a layer of complexity. However, it's easier than the 5% and 15% anchors which require deeper analysis or specific subject knowledge.
