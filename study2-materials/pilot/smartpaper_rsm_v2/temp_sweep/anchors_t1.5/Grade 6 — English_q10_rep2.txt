REASONING: This item tests a basic grammar concept (some/any) which is often explicitly taught and drilled in Class 6. Compared to the anchor items, it requires simple recall and application rather than comprehension, analysis, or multi-part responses, making it significantly easier than "The Last Bargain" or differentiating historical sources. It is comparable to "Fundamental Rights" in terms of direct recall but perhaps slightly easier as it doesn't rely on specific subject knowledge.
