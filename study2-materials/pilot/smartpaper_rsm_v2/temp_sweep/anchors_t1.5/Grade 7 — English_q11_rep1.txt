REASONING: This question is harder than "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%) and "Three questions the king wanted" (50%) because it requires specific grammatical knowledge that is often challenging for Class 7 students, especially distinguishing an adjective phrase from a single adjective or even the entire noun phrase. It is comparable to "My favorite season" (30%) in that it asks for specific textual identification rather than broad conceptual understanding, but the grammatical concept of an adjective phrase might be slightly more abstract than writing about a favorite season. However, it's easier than differentiating historical sources (15%) or finding a poem's theme (5%) as it's a direct identification from a given sentence. The rubric only scores "tiny," not "tiny bird" or "in our balcony," which makes it a very narrow and specific identification. The low pass rates for the anchors suggest that even direct recall or simple application of concepts is difficult.
