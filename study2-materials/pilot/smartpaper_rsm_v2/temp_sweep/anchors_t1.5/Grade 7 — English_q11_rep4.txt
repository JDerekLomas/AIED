REASONING: This question is harder than the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66%) as it requires specific grammatical knowledge that many students at this level struggle with. It's comparable to, but slightly easier than, the "Favorite Season" anchor (30%) as it's a single, direct identification task rather than a paragraph construction. However, many students may struggle to identify 'tiny' as an adjective, often confusing it with verbs or nouns, especially given their performance on more complex tasks. The "Adjective **phrase**" part of the question might also trip them up, as 'tiny' is just an adjective, not a phrase.
