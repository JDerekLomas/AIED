REASONING: This item involves a basic linear equation, which is fundamental in Class 8 mathematics. While it requires understanding negative numbers and basic algebraic manipulation, it is significantly less conceptually demanding than identifying themes, differentiating historical sources, or writing descriptive paragraphs. Students typically practice many such equations. It is on par with, or slightly easier than, naming two Fundamental Rights, as that requires memorization of specific constitutional terms while this is an application of a learned procedure.
