REASONING: This question is slightly harder than the 50% anchor because it requires inferential thinking and relating the passage to real life, not just recalling information directly from the text. However, it's easier than the 30% and 15% anchors as it still connects to the passage and asks for a personal opinion, which Class 7 students often find less daunting than thematic analysis or formal definitions.
