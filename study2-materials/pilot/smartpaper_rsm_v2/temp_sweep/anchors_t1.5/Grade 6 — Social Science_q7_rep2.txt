REASONING: This question is comparable to the 50% pass rate anchor question, "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" because both require direct recall of factual information that has likely been explicitly taught, but also involves an additional step of explaining the influence of one of the resources, which may slightly increase difficulty for some students. The vocabulary and concepts (natural resources, influence lives) are familiar from the curriculum, similar to Fundamental Rights.
