REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" anchor in its recall requirement and the "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" in needing both recall and a brief description. Given that occupations in Rajasthan are likely a well-covered topic in Class 7 Social Science, and only two occupations plus a brief description are needed, it's easier than the "Differentiate" question, but slightly harder than simply naming two Fundamental Rights, which is often a rote-learned list.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
