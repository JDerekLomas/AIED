REASONING: This item is significantly easier than the anchor items. It tests a fundamental aspect of English grammar (sentence structure) that Class 6 students would have practiced extensively, requiring recall and simple rearrangement rather than comprehension, analytical thinking, or factual knowledge recall like the "Last Bargain" theme or "Archaeological vs. Literary sources." It's also less demanding than writing a full paragraph or recalling specific factual information like the "King's questions" or "Fundamental Rights."
