REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the 'Fundamental Rights' question as it requires recalling a single descriptor. However, it's slightly harder than 'Fundamental Rights' because it requires subjective interpretation of a *writing style* rather than a concrete fact, and students might struggle to articulate an appropriate descriptive word. It is much easier than 'Theme of The Last Bargain' as that requires a more nuanced and abstract understanding.
