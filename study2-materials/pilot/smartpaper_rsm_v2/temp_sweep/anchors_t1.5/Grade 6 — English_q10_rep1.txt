REASONING: This item tests a very basic grammatical concept (some/any) which is often covered early and reinforced frequently. It requires simple recall and application, unlike the anchor items which demand understanding of themes, differentiation, paragraph writing, or recall of specific factual knowledge from a passage/social science. Given the low pass rates on comprehension and higher-order thinking tasks, a simple fill-in-the-blank grammar question should be significantly easier.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
