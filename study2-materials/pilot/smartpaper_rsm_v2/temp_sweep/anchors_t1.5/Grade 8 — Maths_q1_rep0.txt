REASONING: This item involves a basic linear equation, requiring only one step of subtraction with negative numbers, which is a core concept taught in Class 8 mathematics. While negative numbers can sometimes pose a challenge, the operation itself is straightforward. This is significantly easier than the English comprehension (poem theme, paragraph writing) or social science questions (differentiating sources, fundamental rights) which require interpretation, recall of specific facts, or constructing multiple sentences. The closest comparison might be "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" but that still requires recalling information from a passage.
