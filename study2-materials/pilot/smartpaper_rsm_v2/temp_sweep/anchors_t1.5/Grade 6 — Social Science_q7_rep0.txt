REASONING: This item requires recalling two specific facts about Rajasthan's natural resources and then providing a basic explanation of influence, which is similar in difficulty to naming Fundamental Rights but slightly more complex due to the explanation component. However, the explanation is open-ended and only needs to be about *one* resource, making it less demanding than the 'Differentiate' question or the 'Theme of Poem' question.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
