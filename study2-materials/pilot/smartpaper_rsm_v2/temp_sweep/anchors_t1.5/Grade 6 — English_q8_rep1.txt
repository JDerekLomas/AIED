REASONING: This item is significantly easier than the anchor items. It tests a very basic grammatical structure (SVO) that Class 6 students should have encountered numerous times, unlike the complex literary analysis, historical differentiation, or constitutional knowledge required for the lower-performing anchor items. It's even simpler than the "three questions the king wanted to answer" as it doesn't require recall from a passage.
