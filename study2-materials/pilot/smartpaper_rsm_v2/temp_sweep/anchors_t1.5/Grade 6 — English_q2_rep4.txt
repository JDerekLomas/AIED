REASONING: This question is a direct recall from a story that is likely to be quite popular or recently taught, similar to the "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate). It requires straightforward identification of a character. Given that the answer is short and specific, it's easier than synthesizing a theme or differentiating concepts, but slightly harder than naming fundamental rights as it relies on specific story recall rather than general knowledge.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
