REASONING: This question is harder than "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%) because it requires more than just recall of factual information. It is also harder than "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%) as the student has to understand a grammatical concept, not just locate information in a passage. It is easier than the "favorite season" (30%) item, which requires multiple sentences and more developed thought. The core difficulty lies in distinguishing an adjective *phrase* from an adjective, given that "tiny" is an adjective but not a phrase.
