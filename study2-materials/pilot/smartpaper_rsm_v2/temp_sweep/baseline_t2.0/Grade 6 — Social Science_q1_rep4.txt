As an experienced teacher in this setting, here's my breakdown of how students would likely perform on this question:

The question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" requires recall of geographical facts taught in class. While "major" is a bit subjective, the examples provided in the rubric are all commonly covered in Class 6 Indian geography.

Here's my estimation, considering the factors you've highlighted:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they know the names in Hindi, translating and writing them correctly in English is extremely difficult. Many won't even comprehend the question "Name any two major mountain ranges..."
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is purely recall, but their limited literacy significantly impacts their ability to demonstrate that recall.
* **Common mistakes:** Will likely leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant due to lack of understanding. If they do write something, it will likely be one incorrect range or misspelt to the point of being unrecognizable.

**basic: 5% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They might be able to partially understand the question, or recognize keywords like "mountain" and "India." However, the "name any two" part and the need to recall specific English names will still be challenging. They might know one name correctly but struggle with the second, or misspell one beyond recognition.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They have some foundational knowledge, but their ability to access and articulate it in English is weak.
* **Common mistakes:** Many will likely get only one correct name (earning 0.5 marks, not full). Spelling will be a major issue, even for familiar names. Some might write one name, think they've finished, and not realize they needed two.

**competent: 50% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They will understand the question well. They would have been consistently working on their English vocabulary and spelling in geography.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will be able to recall at least two major mountain ranges with relative ease. They've likely seen and written these names multiple times in class exercises and homework.
* **Common mistakes:** Some might misspell one of the ranges, or recall only one for some reason (e.g., test anxiety, brief lapse of memory), thus not getting full marks. Others might choose less "major" ones they remember instead of the most common ones.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issue here. They comprehend the question perfectly.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will immediately recall multiple major mountain ranges (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western/Eastern Ghats) and can confidently write any two with correct spelling.
* **Common mistakes:** A very small percentage might have a moment of absent-mindedness and only write one, or make a very minor spelling error, but generally, this group will excel. They often exceed expectations and remember more details.
