This is a great question that hits at the heart of the challenges and nuances of teaching English in this specific context. Here's my breakdown based on experience:

*   **Language barriers (many can't read English well):** This is a huge factor. Many struggling students would have difficulty just reading and understanding the *active* sentence itself, let alone performing the transformation. Even basic students might stumble on "blew" as the past tense of "blow."
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** Transforming voices *requires* both. Students need to recall the rules of subject-object inversion, the use of "be" verbs, and the past participle. They also need to reason about *which* verb form to use (was/were). For this specific sentence, "blown" is often a stumbling block.
*   **How specific the required answer is:** The answer is quite specific. "The leaves were blown away by the wind" or "The leaves were blown away" are the only fully correct options. Variations like "The leaves *are* blown..." or "The leaves *has* been blown..." would lose marks. Omitting "by the wind" might be acceptable for some teachers, but strict rubric says "correctly transforms *the* sentence," implying all elements. I'll assume "by the wind" is preferred but optional.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Tense errors:** Using present tense ("The leaves *are* blown...")
    *   **Verb form errors:** "The leaves were *blowed*" (very common!) or "The leaves were *blowing*."
    *   **Incorrect subject/object placement:** "The wind was blown the leaves away."
    *   **Dropping "by the wind" if they don't grasp its optionality/purpose.**
    *   **Confusion with active voice structure:** Attempting to make a passive sentence that still sounds like an active one.

Given these considerations, here's my estimated score distribution:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 5% full marks
competent: 50% full marks
advanced: 80% full marks

**Elaboration:**

*   **Struggling:** Zero. They would struggle to read "blew," understand "away," and recall "blow." The concept of "voice" would be completely alien or too complex to apply consistently. They might just re-read the sentence or offer a random word.
*   **Basic:** A very small percentage. They might *recognize* "blew" as past tense and attempt to use "were," but "blown" is often the big stumbling block for them. Many would say "were blowed" or "were blowing." If they manage the "were blown," they might forget "by the wind." The cognitive load of juggling subject-object, tense, and past participle form is very high.
*   **Competent:** This group would generally understand the concept of passive voice. Their primary challenge would be recalling the correct past participle of irregular verbs like "blow" ("blown" vs. "blowed"). Some might get the correct tense (were) but falter on the participle. Those who drilled their irregular verbs would do well.
*   **Advanced:** Most of these students would have a solid grasp of grammar rules, including irregular verbs. Their primary hurdle would be a slip of concentration or a minor recall error under exam conditions. They'd confidently produce "The leaves were blown away by the wind."
