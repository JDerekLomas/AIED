Okay, this is a very common scenario in our classrooms. Let's break this down for a Class 6 English question after a story has been taught.

The question "Who lived inside the book?" is a *recall* question. It directly tests if they remember a specific detail from the text.

Considering the breakdown of student abilities:

*   **Language barriers:** For many, just *reading and comprehending* the question itself ("Who lived inside...?") might be a hurdle. If they don't grasp "lived inside," their answer will be a guess or blank.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall. If they weren't paying attention, or if the concept of "a fairy *living* inside a book" was abstract or unclear to them during the teaching, they won't remember.
*   **Specificity of answer:** "A magical fairy" or "fairy" is quite specific. We accept "fairy," which makes it a bit easier than needing "magical fairy," but still, they need to pinpoint that particular character.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Confusing the fairy with another character in the story (if there were others).
    *   Not understanding "lived inside" and instead mentioning what the fairy *did*.
    *   Simply stating a random English word they remember if they couldn't recall "fairy."
    *   Answering in Hindi even if they know the answer.
    *   Misspelling "fairy" to the point of being unrecognizable (e.g., "phery"). We might be lenient, but if it's completely off, it might not score.

Let's estimate the percentages:

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** These students often struggle with basic sight words, simple sentence comprehension, and recalling specific details from English text, especially if it was a narrative with slightly fantastical elements. Many might not even decode the question properly. If they do understand the question, retrieving "fairy" might be difficult. Their focus is often on individual words rather than the overall meaning or key characters.
    *   **struggling: 0% full marks** (Even with leniency for spelling, the complete lack of understanding the question or the specific recall makes this highly unlikely for full marks. Maybe 1-2 might get half if they write something like "pari" and we infer, but for "full marks," unlikely.)

*   **Basic (35% of class):** These students can follow simpler stories but might miss nuances. They understand basic questions but might need prompting. They may have understood the story with significant help during class. They might remember *that* something lived inside the book, but recalling *what* exactly without context can be tricky. Some might remember "pari" (Hindi for fairy) and translate it, or recall the English word if it was emphasized repeatedly.
    *   **basic: 20% full marks** (A small segment of this group, especially if the teacher explicitly highlighted "a fairy lived inside the book" multiple times, might get this. Some might write "fairy" with acceptable spelling, while others might attempt but fail due to poor spelling or incomplete understanding.)

*   **Competent (20% of class):** These students generally follow the lessons well, understand most of what's taught, and can comprehend simpler English texts independently. They likely engaged with the story and identified key characters. They should be able to recall "fairy" quite easily.
    *   **competent: 85% full marks** (Most of these students should get this. The remaining 15% might make a minor spelling error that isn't acceptable, or have a momentary lapse in memory. But overall, they have the language proficiency and recall ability.)

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** These students are often quite strong, can read and comprehend independently, and retain information well. They would have no difficulty understanding the question or recalling the character's name. They are also less prone to spelling errors.
    *   **advanced: 100% full marks** (This would be an easy question for them.)

**Summary:**

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 20% full marks
competent: 85% full marks
advanced: 100% full marks
