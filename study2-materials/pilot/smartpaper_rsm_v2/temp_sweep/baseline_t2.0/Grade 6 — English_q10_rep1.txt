This is a classic 'some/any' question that we tackle frequently in Class 6. Considering the student profile and the nature of the question, here's my breakdown:

**Understanding the Challenges for Different Groups:**

*   **Language barriers (many can't read English well):** The ability to *read* the sentence itself is the first hurdle for a significant portion of my students. Even if they understand the rule orally, decoding "There are (some/any) apples in the basket" visually might be tough.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question primarily requires recall of a specific grammar rule: 'some' for affirmative sentences and 'any' for negative/interrogative sentences (generally speaking). There's not much room for reasoning beyond that.
*   **Specificity of the answer:** It's a binary choice. If they know the rule, they get it right. If not, they get it wrong.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Using 'any' in affirmative sentences, especially if they are used to hearing/using 'any' a lot in other contexts (e.g., "Do you have any brothers?").
    *   Simply guessing due to not understanding the rule or not being able to read the words.
    *   Confusion with other determiners.

**Percentage breakdown:**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   Many would struggle to read and understand the sentence correctly.
    *   They might recognize 'apples' and 'basket' but linking them meaningfully to 'some' or 'any' would be difficult.
    *   Even if taught, the rule is unlikely to be cemented for them at this stage. They might just guess.
    *   *I'd be optimistic if even a small handful got it right.*
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks**

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   They might be able to read the sentence with some effort or a little prompting.
    *   They would have been exposed to the 'some/any' rule multiple times in class.
    *   However, consistency in applying it without explicit instruction or cues is the challenge. They often get confused if it's not a direct drill. They might still guess or make a common mistake.
    *   *A fair portion would get it, but many would still falter.*
    *   **basic: 40% full marks**

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   They would read the sentence easily and recall the rule.
    *   They usually understand that 'some' is used for positive statements when talking about an unspecified quantity.
    *   They have generally practiced this type of question and grasp the fundamental difference.
    *   *Most of this group should get it right.*
    *   **competent: 85% full marks**

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   They would find this question straightforward.
    *   They apply the rule automatically and are confident in their answer.
    *   They might even implicitly understand *why* 'any' would sound incorrect here.
    *   *Nearly all of them would get this correctly.*
    *   **advanced: 95% full marks**
