Okay, let's break this down based on my experience in a Class 7 English classroom under those conditions.

The question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." requires understanding the core theme of the story, extracting the king's questions (even if not verbatim, understanding their essence), and then applying that understanding to their own 'real life' and providing a reason.

**King's Questions (as per passage):**
1.  What is the right time to begin everything?
2.  Who are the right people to listen to?
3.  What is the most important thing to do?

**Analysis of the Question and Scoring:**
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires *both* recall (understanding what the king's questions *were* conceptually, even if they can't list them perfectly) and reasoning (connecting those concepts to "real life" and providing a reason). The prompt simplifies it a bit by saying "The king wanted to answer... any valid reason," implying a general understanding is key, not perfect recall of all three.
*   **Language Barrier:** The phrase "important in real life" is fairly common, but "valid reason" might trip up some. The word "important" itself is generally understood. The biggest hurdle will be the entire sentence structure for many.
*   **Specificity:** "Any valid reason" makes it quite open-ended, which is helpful. A student could say, "Yes, because if you know the right time, you won't waste time," or "Yes, because good friends help you," or "Yes, because it helps us do good things." These are simple reasons, but valid.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Misunderstanding the prompt:** Answering "No" without a valid reason, or just restating the king's questions without connecting them to "real life."
    *   **Limited vocabulary/sentence construction:** Wanting to give a reason but struggling to form a coherent sentence in English.
    *   **Literal interpretation:** Some might focus only on kings and forget "real life."
    *   **Focus on story events:** Answering with something like, "Yes, because the hermit told him to dig the ground," which is a story event, not a real-life application of the question's *importance*.

Here's my prediction for full marks:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   They will struggle immensely with reading and understanding the question itself, let alone generating a thoughtful answer in English. Many might not even attempt to answer, or provide an irrelevant answer based on single words they might have recognized from the passage. They cannot form the sentences needed for a "reason."

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   A small percentage will understand the gist of the question and the story's main point. They might struggle with *articulating* a coherent "reason" in English. They might give very simple, fragmented answers like "Yes, helps us," or "Yes, to be good." Some might get lucky and produce one simple, grammatically awkward but valid reason, or pick up a relevant phrase if they were well-drilled on the moral of the story. They likely won't explicitly mention all three of the king's original questions in their thought process.

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   They understand the core concept of the story (the importance of living in the present, doing good, being with the right people). They will be able to connect the king's seeking wisdom to "real life" importance. They might phrase their reason simply but accurately. For example, "Yes, because knowing the right time helps us to finish our work properly." Or "Yes, it helps us choose good people to be with."

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   They will have no issue understanding the question and connecting the abstract concepts of the king's questions to "real life." They will articulate a clear, concise, and valid reason, often with good grammatical structure. They might even implicitly (or explicitly) allude to more than one of the king's original questions in their reasoning, e.g., "Yes, these questions help us live a better life by knowing what to do and when to do it."
