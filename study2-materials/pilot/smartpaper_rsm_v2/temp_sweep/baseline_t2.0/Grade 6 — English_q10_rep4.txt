This is a good question that highlights common challenges in English language learning for our Class 6 students. Let's break down how I'd expect my students to perform on this item.

**Thinking Process:**

*   **The Concept:** 'Some' vs. 'any' for countable nouns in positive sentences. This is a foundational grammar rule.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires recall of the rule ("some for positive, any for negative/questions"). However, if they *haven't* been taught this specifically or haven't internalized it, they might try to guess based on what "sounds right," which can be hit or miss.
*   **Language Barriers:**
    *   Reading the sentence: "There are... apples in the basket." Most will recognize 'apples' and 'basket'. 'There are' is also fairly common. The key is understanding that this is a positive statement.
    *   Understanding 'some' and 'any': These are very basic words. Their literal meaning might not be fully grasped if they haven't seen them used frequently.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Interference from Hindi sentence structures.
    *   Choosing 'any' because they associate it with quantity (e.g., "Are there any?").
    *   Simply guessing randomly if they don't know the rule.
    *   If the teacher recently covered negatives or questions using 'any', some students might incorrectly overgeneralize and apply 'any' here.
*   **Prior Teaching:** If I had *just* taught 'some' and 'any' with explicit examples and practice, the percentages would be higher, especially for struggling and basic learners. Assuming it's part of a broader curriculum, they might have encountered it, but not necessarily mastered it.

**Prediction:**

*   **struggling:** **10% full marks**
    *   These students struggle with basic sentence construction and vocabulary. Even recognizing all the words might be a task. The rule of 'some' for positive statements would likely be entirely new or very difficult to retain for them without intensive, repeated practice. A small percentage might guess correctly by chance or vaguely remembering seeing 'some' used this way.
*   **basic:** **40% full marks**
    *   They understand the sentence fairly well. They might have encountered 'some' and 'any' before. Some would recall the rule correctly if taught explicitly. Others might pick 'some' because it "sounds more natural" in a positive statement, especially if they've heard it a few times. However, the distinction is tricky, and many might mix it up or guess incorrectly.
*   **competent:** **75% full marks**
    *   These students generally grasp common grammar rules when taught. They would likely recall the rule for 'some' in positive sentences. They have better reading comprehension and can process the question effectively. A few might still make a careless error or momentarily confuse the rule if they are not entirely confident.
*   **advanced:** **95% full marks**
    *   They would almost certainly know this fundamental rule. Their exposure to English outside the classroom might also reinforce it. They understand the concept of a positive statement and correctly apply the 'some' rule without hesitation. The remaining 5% might be due to a genuine misunderstanding or a rare careless mistake.
