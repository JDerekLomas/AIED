Alright, let's break down this question based on my experience with Class 6 students in a government school, keeping all the context in mind.

First, the core challenge for many isn't necessarily the math *concept* (addition and multiplication), but navigating the language, extracting the right numbers, and then the time calculation.

Here's my prediction:

*   **struggling:** 5% full marks
*   **basic:** 25% full marks
*   **competent:** 75% full marks
*   **advanced:** 95% full marks

Let me elaborate on the reasoning for each group:

**Struggling (35% of students):**

*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour" and "what will be the temperature... at 4:00 in the evening?" will be hard to parse. Many might catch "30" and "2" and try to add or multiply them without understanding the context. "10 am" and "4:00 pm" will be particularly tricky for them to process as a time difference.
*   **Time Calculation (10 am to 4 pm):** This is a specific recall/reasoning skill. Counting hours on fingers might work for some, but many struggle with telling time precisely, let alone calculating elapsed time across am/pm, even with an analog clock visual aid (which they won't have here). They might just do 10-4=6, but for some, the AM/PM makes it harder.
*   **Reasoning:** They often default to direct operation if they catch numbers (e.g., 30 + 2 or 30 x 2), failing to break the problem into steps.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Adding 30+2 directly. Or just calculating 4-10. Or not even starting the problem because they can't understand the question. Even if they get "6 hours," multiplying 6x2 and then adding 30 will be a stretch if they haven't processed the *meaning*.

**Basic (35% of students):**

*   **Language Barrier:** They will likely be able to read most words, but understanding the *implications* might still be a struggle. "Increases by per hour" is crucial. They'll need to re-read multiple times, and even then, may miss key operational words.
*   **Time Calculation (10 am to 4 pm):** This is where some will succeed. Counting on fingers (11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 = 6 hours) is a common strategy. Some might even intuitively know 10 to 12 is 2 hours, then 12 to 4 is 4 hours, so 2+4=6. However, it's not guaranteed. Some might make an error like 10-4=6, which is numerically correct but might stem from a simplified and incomplete understanding of time.
*   **Reasoning:** If they manage to calculate the hours, the next step (multiplying by 2, then adding to 30) is within their reach. Their errors are usually in the initial parsing or the intermediate calculation steps.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Correctly finding 6 hours, but then maybe multiplying 30 by 6, or just adding 30+2, or some other misinterpretation. Getting 6 hours but failing the rest of the problem is a significant possibility.

**Competent (20% of students):**

*   **Language Barrier:** They will understand the question quite well. They might take a moment to process the full meaning but will grasp the operational flow (initial temp + (rate * time)).
*   **Time Calculation (10 am to 4 pm):** Most will accurately calculate the 6 hours. They often have a better conceptual understanding of time elapsed.
*   **Reasoning:** This is a multi-step problem, which they are generally comfortable with.
    1.  Calculate time: 4 PM - 10 AM = 6 hours.
    2.  Calculate total increase: 6 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.
    3.  Calculate final temperature: 30 degrees + 12 degrees = 42 degrees.
    They can execute these steps with relatively few errors.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Perhaps a minor arithmetic slip, or momentarily misreading "increases" as "decreases" if they rush. But full marks for the elapsed time step is highly probable.

**Advanced (10% of students):**

*   **Language Barrier:** No issue at all. They will quickly understand
