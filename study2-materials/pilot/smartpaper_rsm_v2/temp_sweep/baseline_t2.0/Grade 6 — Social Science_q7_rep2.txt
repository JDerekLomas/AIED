Namaste बच्चों! Ram Ram sabko! Aa jao sab, jaldi se class mein baith jao.

Toh chalo, aaj hum thoda Rajasthan ke baare mein baat karenge. Humara pyaara Rajasthan! Jaante ho na sab Rajasthan? Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur... naam sune hain? (I'd gauge their understanding and link it to their existing knowledge.)

Aaj ka sawal hai, Rajasthan mein milne wale koi bhi do prakritik sansadhan (natural resources) batao. Aur unmein se kisi ek ka, wahan ke logon ki zindagi par kya asar padta hai, yeh samjhao.

(I would repeat the question in simpler Hindi, maybe drawing some examples, but not giving away the answer directly.)
*Prakritik sansadhan kya hota hai? Jo cheezein humein kudrat se milti hain, jinko hum banate nahin, jaise pani, hawa, mitti, pahad mein se nikalne wale patthar ya dhaatu (metals).*

*Rajasthan mein aise kaun-kaun se prakritik sansadhan milte hain? Aur unmein se koi ek, Rajasthan ke logon ki life par, unki rozi-roti par, unke rehan-sehan par kaise asar dalta hai, yeh bataana hai.*

**Based on my experience:**

*   **struggling: 0-5% full marks**
    *   Many struggling students would be completely lost by the English phrasing "natural resources" and "influences the lives". Even after translating, connecting "prakritik sansadhan" with concrete examples like "paani" or "pathar" and then explaining "prabhav/asar" is a big leap for them. They might just list one thing, or get completely confused. Their recall for specific geographical facts is often weak, and linking it to socio-economic impact is a higher-order thinking skill they rarely demonstrate independently.
    *   *Common mistakes:* Writing irrelevant words, listing a city name instead of a resource, or failing to understand the core concept of "influence".

*   **basic: 20-30% full marks**
    *   They might understand the core idea of "natural resources" with some prompting or after a simple Hindi translation. They *might* be able to recall one or two common resources (like "paani" or "reghistan mein ret/sand").
    *   The challenge will be explaining the *influence*. They might say "paani important hai" but struggle to articulate *how* it influences lives (e.g., agriculture, drinking, animal husbandry). They'd likely give a very simplistic, one-line answer for the influence, or list things without explaining the connection.
    *   *Common mistakes:* Naming only one resource, failing to explain the influence beyond a very basic statement, or explaining the influence for an irrelevant resource.

*   **competent: 60-70% full marks**
    *   These students will likely understand "natural resources" and "influence" reasonably well, even if they need a moment to process the English. They can recall at least two resources, such as water and marble/sandstone, or perhaps even solar energy given recent exposure to new topics.
    *   They would be able to explain the influence of one resource, though perhaps not with great detail or nuanced vocabulary. For example, for water, they'd link it to farming, drinking, or livelihood directly. For marble, they'd say "ghar banane mein kaam aata hai" or "moortiyan banti hain" which is sufficient for "influence."
    *   *Common mistakes:* Perhaps missing a very specific influence point, or only writing one example for influence, or a slight misidentification of a resource.

*   **advanced: 90-100% full marks**
    *   These students would typically read the English question, understand it clearly, and immediately recall two appropriate natural resources like water, marble, copper, or even solar/wind energy.
    *   They would confidently explain how one of them influences life, providing relevant examples (e.g., water scarcity impacting agriculture, migration, settlement patterns; marble supporting construction industry, employment, architectural heritage). They might use slightly more complex sentences and provide a couple of examples for the influence. They are able to make the conceptual links required.
    *   *Common mistakes:* Extremely rare for them on a question like this, maybe a minor grammatical error in English if they choose to write it in English.
