Okay, let's break this down based on my experience in the classroom with Class 8 students from such backgrounds.

The equation is `y + 9 = 4`.
The target is `y = -5`.

Here's my analysis for each group:

*   **Language Barrier:** The equation `y + 9 = 4` is quite symbolic and less reliant on complex English phrasing. Most students will recognize `y` as a variable, `+` as addition, and `=` as equals. The challenge isn't primarily the *reading* of the equation itself, but rather the conceptual understanding.

*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires a mix.
    *   **Recall:** Students need to recall the concept of an equation, variables, and how to "isolate" the variable by performing inverse operations. They need to recall addition and subtraction facts.
    *   **Reasoning:** The main reasoning involved is understanding the concept of transposing terms or applying the inverse operation to *both sides* of the equation. Critically, it involves understanding *negative numbers*, especially when the result of subtraction is negative. This is where many struggles lie.

*   **Specificity of Answer:** The answer is very specific (`-5`). There's no room for partial understanding like approximating or giving an incorrect sign.

*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **"Bigger minus smaller" mentality:** Many students struggle with subtraction where the first number is smaller than the second. For `4 - 9`, they might instinctively do `9 - 4 = 5` and then struggle with the sign, or just write `5`.
    *   **Transposing errors:** Instead of `y = 4 - 9`, they might write `y = 9 - 4` or even `y = 4 + 9` (if they mistakenly think it's always "add the other number").
    *   **Ignoring the sign:** Even if they get `5`, they might forget or incorrectly assign the negative sign.
    *   **"What plus 9 gives 4?" logic:** Some will try to guess. They might think `y` has to be a positive number because `9` is positive and `4` is positive, making it difficult for them to arrive at a negative `y`.

Here's my estimation for full marks:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*Reasoning:* These students would likely commit most, if not all, of the common mistakes. They struggle with basic arithmetic facts, understanding the concept of a variable, and definitely with negative numbers. The idea of "taking 9 to the other side and changing its sign" might be recited but not correctly applied to `4 - 9`.

**basic:** 20% full marks
*Reasoning:* This group might successfully transpose the `9` to get `y = 4 - 9`. However, the critical hurdle will be calculating `4 - 9` correctly as `-5`. Many would make the mistake of `9 - 4 = 5` or struggle significantly with the concept of a negative answer in this context. Some might even try to guess and get it wrong. The 20% would be those who have grasped integer subtraction relatively well or can apply the "debt" concept successfully.

**competent:** 80% full marks
*Reasoning:* These students have a solid understanding of basic equation solving, transposing, and working with integers. They understand that `y` can be a negative number. While a small percentage might still make a careless error with the sign or the subtraction, the majority would correctly solve for `y = -5`.

**advanced:** 100% full marks
*Reasoning:* Students in this category would find this question straightforward. They are comfortable with integer operations, solving linear equations, and would correctly execute the steps to arrive at `y = -5` without issues.
