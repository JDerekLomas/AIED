This is a common question, and one I often use to assess basic writing skills and ability to express personal ideas. Given the context of my students, I anticipate the following distribution:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
Many struggling students would likely attempt to write, but their output would be a collection of disjointed sentences, incorrect grammar, and poor sentence structure. They might mention a hobby (e.g., "play cricket"), but connecting it to when they do it or why they enjoy it in complete sentences would be extremely challenging. Spelling errors would be abundant, and some might even write it in a mix of Hindi and English words. They may not even understand what a "paragraph" is.

**basic: 10% full marks**
These students might be able to string together 2-3 simple sentences. They would probably state their hobby, and perhaps when they do it (e.g., "My hobby is playing. I play in evening."). The "why they enjoy it" part would be missing or extremely rudimentary ("It is fun."). Grammatical errors would still be present, and the flow of the "paragraph" might be choppy, not truly forming a coherent paragraph. The sentence structure for 'when' and 'why' might not be correct as well.

**competent: 50% full marks**
Students in this category would generally be able to understand the prompt and structure a response. They would likely mention their hobby, when they do it, and offer a simple reason why they enjoy it, probably using familiar vocabulary. The sentences would be mostly grammatically correct, though there might be a few minor errors. The paragraph might be on the shorter side, possibly 3-4 sentences. They understand the paragraph structure but might lack varied vocabulary or more elaborate reasons.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
These students would comfortably address all parts of the prompt, using good sentence structure and appropriate vocabulary. Their paragraph would flow well, and they might even include a slightly more elaborate reason for enjoying their hobby. Grammatical errors would be minimal, if any. They are familiar with expressing their thoughts clearly and constructing coherent sentences.
