As an experienced teacher in an Indian government school, Class 8 Social Science, I have a good sense of my students' abilities and common challenges. Here's my estimation for the given question on Harappan Civilization's urban planning:

*   **struggling: 0% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** Even if they might dimly recall something about "drains" or "pukka bricks," articulating a "key feature of urban planning" in English, as per the rubric's required specificity, would be nearly impossible for them. The language barrier is significant. They struggle with basic reading comprehension, let alone formulating a structured answer.
*   **basic: 5-10% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** A small fraction might have memorized a key phrase like "well-planned city" or "good drainage system" if it was repeatedly emphasized in class in Hindi and then they can attempt to translate/recall an equivalent in English. They might recall "pakki eent" (baked bricks) but framing it as "use of baked bricks" as a *feature of urban planning* might be a stretch for most. They are recall-oriented, but precise recall and framing are difficult. Most will give fragmented answers that might touch upon a feature but not describe it accurately enough for full marks.
*   **competent: 60-70% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** These students often understand the concepts well, even if primarily explained in Hindi. They have a decent grasp of English to recall and articulate a key feature like the grid pattern of streets, the advanced drainage, or the citadel/lower town division. They would likely remember specific details because it's a foundational topic. They've probably written about this in their notebooks during class.
*   **advanced: 90-100% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** These students excel in comprehension and expression. They would easily recall and accurately describe one of the key features, using appropriate terminology and demonstrating a clear understanding of what "urban planning" entails. They can articulate this clearly despite their primary language being Hindi, as their English skills are relatively stronger.
