Here's my assessment based on my experience:

struggling: 0-5% full marks
basic: 10-15% full marks
competent: 50-60% full marks
advanced: 80-90% full marks

**Thinking process behind these percentages:**

*   **Language barriers & "Can't read English well":** This is the biggest hurdle. The question itself, "Describes the poet's writing style," uses the word "describes" which might be challenging for struggling students. Even if they understand *poet* and *writing*, *style* is an abstract concept that many won't have the vocabulary or conceptual framework for. Many might focus on the content of the poem rather than its presentation.

*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question heavily relies on reasoning and understanding abstract literary concepts. It's not a direct recall question like "Who is the main character?". Students need to have a prior understanding of what "writing style" means, then apply it to the text they've read. If the poem was explicitly taught with a focus on its style (e.g., "Notice how the poet uses simple words here"), then some element of recall might come in, but generally, it's inferential.

*   **How specific the required answer is:** The rubric allows for flexibility ("suitable and relevant word... or other appropriate word"). This helps, but the challenge is in finding *any* appropriate word, not necessarily the *most* precise one.

*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Focusing on content:** Many students would describe what the poem *is about* rather than *how* it's written. ("The poet writes about nature," "The poet writes about his village.")
    *   **Giving an opinion instead of a description:** "I like the poet's writing," "It's a good poem."
    *   **Lack of vocabulary:** Even if they grasp the concept, finding the right adjective ("simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct") might be difficult for basic and struggling learners. They might only know very generic adjectives if any.
    *   **Misinterpreting "style":** Some might think "style" refers to handwriting or the layout on the page.
    *   **Leaving it blank:** Many struggling students, if they don't understand, will simply not attempt it.

**Breakdown by group:**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   Most will not understand "writing style" or "describes."
    *   Their vocabulary is extremely limited.
    *   Likely to give content-based answers, opinions, or leave it blank.
    *   A tiny fraction (5%) *might*, if they picked up one specific adjective used by the teacher repeatedly during discussion, provide a suitable word, or if the poem was exceedingly simple and direct, they *might* pick up "simple."

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   Some might vaguely understand "writing style" but struggle to articulate it.
    *   They might understand "describes" but struggle with *what* to describe.
    *   Many will still resort to content description.
    *   A significant portion might understand enough to look for an adjective but may struggle to find the *right* one that isn't content-focused.
    *   If the poem was *very obviously* simple and we spent time on it, maybe 10-15% could arrive at "simple" or "easy to understand."

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   They likely understand the question and the concept of "writing style."
    *   They have a better vocabulary pool.
    *   They would attempt to analyze the poem's structure, word choice, and tone.
    *   They might use words like "simple," "clear," "descriptive," "engaging," "narrative," "expressive." There might still be some who struggle to find the most fitting single word, perhaps giving a short phrase instead.

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   They fully grasp the question and concept.
    *   They possess the vocabulary to choose a precise and appropriate adjective.
    *   They are more likely to think critically about the poet's choices and convey that in their answer. They might even pick up on subtleties like "conversational," "informal," "vivid."

This question effectively acts as a discriminator, revealing understanding beyond basic comprehension and into critical analysis and vocabulary application.
