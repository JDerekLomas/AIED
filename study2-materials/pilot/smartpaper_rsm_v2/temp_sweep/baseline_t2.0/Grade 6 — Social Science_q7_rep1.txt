As an experienced teacher in an Indian government school, Class 6 Social Science, here's my assessment of student performance on the given question:

**Natural Resources of Rajasthan & their influence:**

The question asks for two natural resources from Rajasthan and an explanation of how one influences people's lives. This question is a mix of recall and basic reasoning.

*   **Recall (Resources):** This part requires students to have learned specific facts about Rajasthan's resources.
*   **Reasoning (Influence):** This part requires a basic understanding of cause and effect – how a natural resource impacts daily life, occupations, or culture.

Here's my breakdown by student ability group:

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** This is a major hurdle. Many will struggle to even read and comprehend the question in English. They might pick up keywords like "Rajasthan" and "natural resources" but miss the "how it influences" part.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might struggle with recalling *any* two correct resources if their foundational knowledge is weak. Even if they recall one, connecting it to "influence" would be very difficult.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Listing non-natural resources (like "clothes" or "food"), mentioning resources not found in Rajasthan, or simply listing two resources without any explanation for the second part of the question.
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks** (These might be students who have received specific remedial help, or who manage to recall a very common resource like 'water' and connect it simplistically to 'drinking' or 'farming', aided by a classroom activity they remember).

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** They will generally understand the question's core meaning, perhaps needing to read it twice or break it down. "Influence" might still be a slightly tricky word for some.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall 1-2 common natural resources (e.g., water, sand, sunlight, some minerals if explicitly taught). Explaining the influence of *one* might be attempted, but it could be very general (e.g., "water is used for drinking and farming"). Their explanations might lack detail or nuance.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Getting one resource correct and one incorrect, or explaining the influence too briefly or vaguely.
    *   **basic: 40% full marks** (They might correctly name 'water' and 'sand' or 'marble'. For the explanation, they will likely choose water and say it's for drinking and farming, which satisfies the rubric.)

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** They will comfortably read and understand the question.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will confidently recall two correct natural resources, often mentioning common ones like Marble, Copper, or Water. Their explanation of the influence will be more articulate and may include multiple aspects (e.g., water for agriculture, drinking, animal rearing; marble for building houses, temples, economy).
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Very few, maybe a minor grammatical error or slightly less elaborate explanation than advanced students.
    *   **competent: 85% full marks** (They know the facts and can explain clearly.)

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** No issue at all.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will likely recall specific resources and might even choose less obvious ones like "sunlight" (for solar energy) or "wind" (for wind energy) if these have been discussed, demonstrating a deeper understanding. Their explanation of the influence will be well-structured, detailed, and insightful, possibly touching upon economic aspects or traditional uses.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Highly unlikely to make mistakes on this type of question.
    *   **advanced: 100% full marks** (They would exceed expectations, possibly giving multiple points for influence.)
