This is a common question, and based on my experience, it often yields interesting results and highlights the various challenges our students face. Here's my breakdown:

**Struggling: 5% full marks**

*   **Language Barrier is a massive hurdle:** Many struggling students will have difficulty simply reading the question, let alone understanding the vocabulary "denotes," "mentions," and "why." They might just point to a random line without understanding what is being asked.
*   **Difficulty with 'liking' and 'why':** Even if they manage to read the words, the abstract concept of "liking" something in a poem and then articulating "why" is quite advanced for this group. Their reasoning skills in English are not yet developed for such tasks.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires reasoning *after* recall. While some might recall a line, linking it to a personal preference and then explaining that preference is a multi-step cognitive process that most struggling students will falter on.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Pointing to the first or last line without reason; copying a random line without explaining; simply saying "I like this line" without elaborating; misinterpreting the question entirely. They might just list some words they remember from the poem.

**Basic: 25% full marks**

*   **Slightly better reading comprehension:** This group can generally read the question and most lines of the poem, though some vocabulary might still be challenging.
*   **Identifying a line:** A good portion of this group can successfully identify *a* line from the poem.
*   **Difficulty with 'why':** This is where the scores will drop. Many might give very simplistic or vague reasons, like "it sounds good" or "I like these words." They struggle to elaborate beyond a surface-level response. Their "why" might be rote-learned from a previous discussion or a single word answer that doesn't fully explain.
*   **Limited vocabulary for explanation:** Even if they have a reason in mind (e.g., "it reminds me of my village"), they might lack the English vocabulary and sentence structures to express it clearly and fully, thus not quite hitting the "mentions why" criterion adequately for full marks.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Giving a line but an insufficient or vague "why"; providing a "why" that isn't directly related to the meaning or feeling of the line.

**Competent: 70% full marks**

*   **Good reading comprehension:** Most in this group will easily understand the question and can read the poem fluently enough to identify lines they might genuinely prefer.
*   **Reasoning skills are emerging:** They are more capable of connecting their personal feelings or experiences to a line. Their explanations for "why" will be more developed than the "basic" group.
*   **Adequate vocabulary for explanation:** They can construct simple sentences to convey their reason. For example, "I like this line because it tells about..." or "It makes me feel happy/sad because..."
*   **They understand the intent:** They grasp that they need to *explain* their preference.
*   **Common Mistakes:** While generally scoring well, some might still give slightly generic reasons or struggle to articulate a deeper meaning if the line chosen requires it. Some might paraphrase the line rather than explaining their liking.

**Advanced: 95% full marks**

*   **Full comprehension:** This group will have no problem understanding the question or the poem.
*   **Well-developed reasoning:** They are adept at selecting a line and providing a clear, often thoughtful, reason for their preference. Their explanations will be more nuanced.
*   **Strong vocabulary and sentence structure:** They can express complex ideas more eloquently, ensuring their "why" is detailed and clearly articulated, satisfying the rubric completely. They might draw connections to other themes or their own life experiences more easily.
*   **Beyond the obvious:** They might pick a less obvious line and explain their connection to it very well, demonstrating deeper engagement with the poem.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very rarely will this group make significant mistakes, but occasionally a student might be overly verbose or choose a reason that, while elaborate, doesn't quite directly address *why* they *like* the line specifically in relation to the poem's context.

Overall, this question, while seemingly straightforward, heavily relies on a student's ability to not only recall information but also engage in abstract reasoning and articulate those thoughts in a language they may not be fully comfortable with. The "why" is the biggest differentiating factor.
