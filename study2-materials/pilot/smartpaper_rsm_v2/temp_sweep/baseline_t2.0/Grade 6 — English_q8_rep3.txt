This is a very common type of exercise, and while seemingly simple, it can be a real challenge for many of my students given their backgrounds. Here's my breakdown:

**Struggling:** 5% full marks
* **Why:** These students often cannot even read all the individual words accurately. They might recognize 'book' and 'he', but 'reading' is a bit longer and trickier. They don't have a mental model of English sentence structure at all. They might just try to put words together in any order or give up entirely. They won't grasp the subject-verb-object concept without direct, repeated instruction.

**Basic:** 30% full marks
* **Why:** Many students at this level can read the individual words. They might have encountered "He is..." or "...a book" phrases before. However, the ordering of "reading" often throws them off. They might produce "He reading a book is" or "A book he is reading." They understand the concept of "doing something" but struggle with the specific grammatical order of present continuous. The 'is' placement can be particularly confusing for them, especially if they try to apply Hindi word order logic (where the verb often comes at the end).

**Competent:** 80% full marks
* **Why:** These students have a decent grasp of basic English sentence structure, especially subject-verb-object. They've likely done similar exercises many times. They understand the auxiliary verb "is" and the -ing form for present continuous. They might pause briefly, but they should arrive at the correct sentence. Their reading comprehension for individual words is good.

**Advanced:** 100% full marks
* **Why:** This type of rearrangement is straightforward for them. They have a solid understanding of English grammar and word order. They will quickly identify the subject, verb phrase, and object, and arrange them correctly without much thought.
