Okay, let's break down how my Class 8 students in a government school, especially from economically weaker and Hindi-medium backgrounds, would fare on "Define fable."

Here's my prediction based on their typical learning patterns and challenges:

*   **Language barriers:** This is a huge hurdle. Even if they grasp the concept in Hindi, translating it into coherent English will be tough for many. "Short story," "animals as characters," "moral lesson" are all specific phrases.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This question *purely* requires recall. If they haven't been explicitly taught "what is a fable" with those key components and reinforced it, they won't magically deduce it.
*   **Specificity:** The rubric is quite specific: "short story," "typically uses animals as characters," and "imparts a moral lesson." Missing any one of these might lead to partial marks, but the question asks for *full marks*.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Many will likely say "it's a story with animals." (Missing "short" and "moral").
    *   Some might say "it teaches something." (Missing "animals" and "short").
    *   Confusion with parables or just "animal stories."
    *   Grammar and spelling errors, even if they have a rough idea.
    *   Lack of specific vocabulary ("imparts a moral lesson" is advanced for many).

Given this, my breakdown would be:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 5% full marks
competent: 40% full marks
advanced: 70% full marks
