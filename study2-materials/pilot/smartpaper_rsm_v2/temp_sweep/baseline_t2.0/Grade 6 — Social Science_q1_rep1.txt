Here's my assessment based on experience with Class 6 Social Science students in a similar setting:

**struggling:** 10% full marks
* **Reasoning:** Even though they've heard the names, the English phrasing "major mountain ranges" might confuse them. They might recognize "Himalaya" but not be able to recall another. They often struggle with retrieval of specific geographical terms, especially when multiple options exist. Some might just write "mountains" if they can't spell the names correctly.

**basic:** 40% full marks
* **Reasoning:** They would likely recognize "Himalayas" easily. Recalling a second one like Aravalli or Vindhya might take a little effort. The single word requirement is helpful, reducing the burden of constructing sentences. However, spelling could still be a minor issue, or they might mix up a river name with a mountain range if not explicitly taught with distinct visual cues.

**competent:** 80% full marks
* **Reasoning:** These students would have a solid recall of at least two prominent mountain ranges. They might even list 3-4, making sure two are correct. They're generally better at retaining information presented in class and connecting it to the English terms.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
* **Reasoning:** These students would confidently list two, possibly even more, with correct spellings. They usually grasp and retain geographical terms and their locations very well, even across subjects. The question is straightforward recall for them.
