Here's how I'd assess my Class 7 English students based on their typical performance and the given prompt:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
Most of these students would struggle immensely to understand the prompt fully. "Favourite hobby" would be a challenge, and constructing even one coherent sentence in English is a major task. They might write isolated words like "play" or "read" without connecting them into sentences or providing the requested details (when, why). Spelling and basic grammar would be very poor, making the paragraph incomprehensible.

**basic: 15% full marks**
A small fraction of students at this level might manage to produce a paragraph that covers all three points, even if with significant grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and simple vocabulary. They might write something like: "My favourite hobby is playing cricket. I play after school. I like it because it is fun." The language would be basic but the meaning generally understandable. However, many in this group would miss one of the elements (e.g., forget to mention "why" or "when"), or their paragraph structure would be too fragmented.

**competent: 60% full marks**
These students have a reasonable grasp of basic sentence structure and vocabulary. They would likely understand the prompt well and be able to construct a 4-5 sentence paragraph addressing all three requirements (hobby, when, why). There would still be grammatical errors, especially with articles, prepositions, and tenses, but the paragraph would be clear and easy to follow. For example: "My favourite hobby is reading storybooks. I read every night before sleeping. I enjoy it because I learn many new things and go to different places in my imagination."

**advanced: 95% full marks**
Students in this category would find this prompt relatively straightforward. They would produce a well-structured paragraph with few grammatical errors, varied vocabulary (even if simple), and clear expression of all the required elements. They might use slightly more complex sentence structures and provide a more articulate reason for their enjoyment. For example: "My favourite hobby is gardening. I usually spend an hour tending to my plants every evening after finishing my homework. I enjoy it because it is very relaxing to watch new flowers bloom, and it connects me with nature."
