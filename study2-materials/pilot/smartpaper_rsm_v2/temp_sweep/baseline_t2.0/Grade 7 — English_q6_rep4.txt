Okay, let's break down this question for my Class 7 students in a government school context.

The question "Describes the poet’s writing style" is deceptively simple but fraught with challenges for my diverse classroom.

**Analysis of the Question and Challenges:**

*   **"Describes"**: This is an instruction, but understanding "describe" in an academic context can be tricky. They might think of "describe the story" not "describe the *style*".
*   **"poet's"**: They might struggle to link "poet" to the specific text if it's not explicitly stated. Sometimes they forget who wrote the poem.
*   **"writing style"**: This is the trickiest part. It's an abstract concept. For many Hindi-medium students, translating "writing style" into something meaningful in English is a major hurdle. They might confuse it with the *topic* of the poem or the *mood*.
    *   *Language Barrier*: Many will not know what "style" means in this context. They might have a Hindi word for it, but connecting it to the expected English vocabulary (simple, descriptive, vivid, lyrical) is tough.
    *   *Vocabulary:* Even if they understand "style," knowing the right English adjectives to describe it is a barrier. "Simple" might be the most accessible, but even that requires analysis.
    *   *Reasoning:* This requires them to analyze the text's *form and language use*, not just its content. This is a higher-order thinking skill than just recalling facts from the poem.
    *   *Specificity*: "A suitable and relevant word" means they need to pick an appropriate adjective, not a phrase.

**Common Mistakes My Students Make:**

1.  **Describing the content/theme:** "He writes about trees," or "The poet writes about nature."
2.  **Describing their feelings:** "The poem makes me happy."
3.  **Using simple evaluation:** "The writing is good," or "It is a nice poem."
4.  **Leaving it blank:** If they don't understand "writing style."
5.  **Giving very general answers not related to style:** "He uses words." (Which is true, but not helpful!)
6.  **Writing in Hindi:** If they are truly lost.

Given these points, here's my prediction for how they would score:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
(They will likely either leave it blank, describe the theme, or struggle to form any coherent English sentence for this abstract concept.)

**basic: 10% full marks**
(A very small fraction might grasp "simple" or "easy to understand" and articulate it, often due to prior exposure to this concept or having a slightly better vocabulary. Most will describe content or say "good.")

**competent: 50% full marks**
(Many in this group will have encountered the concept of "style" before or will be able to deduce from the *type* of poem (often narratives or descriptive poems in Class 7) that "simple" or "descriptive" would be a good fit. They have the vocabulary to express it. The other 50% might give a less precise answer or describe content.)

**advanced: 90% full marks**
(These students have a stronger grasp of English vocabulary and conceptual understanding. They are more likely to think analytically about *how* the poem is written rather than just *what* it says. They will be able to come up with words like "simple," "descriptive," "clear," "vivid," "easy to understand." The remaining 10% might stumble on vocabulary for a really specific style if it's something more nuanced, but for common Class 7 poems, they should get it.)
