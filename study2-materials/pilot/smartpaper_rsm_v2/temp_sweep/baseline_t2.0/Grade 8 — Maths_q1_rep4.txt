This is a great question that perfectly captures the realities of our classroom. Let's break it down by student group.

First, the core challenge is that the concept of negative numbers often trips them up. While they might understand addition and subtraction, the jump to `y = 4 - 9` and then correctly identifying `-5` is where many will falter. The English equation itself, for the struggling and even basic group, might need a translation to feel comfortable.

*   **Language Barrier:** For many, the "equation" part is where they already lose confidence. If I wrote `y jama nau barabar char`, it would significantly increase comprehension for the first two groups. As it is, they'll pick out the numbers and operators but the `y` and `solve` aspect might feel alien if they haven't had enough practice in English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires reasoning for all but the most advanced. They need to understand the inverse operation principle (`+9` becomes `-9` on the other side) and then execute the subtraction with a negative outcome. Recalling that `4-9 = -5` isn't rote for many, it requires thinking it through.
*   **Specificity:** The answer `-5` is highly specific. Any error in the calculation, or simply writing `5`, will lead to zero marks.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Ignoring `y`:** Some might just calculate `9+4=13` or `9-4=5`.
    *   **Sign Error:** `y = 4 - 9 = 5` (incorrectly assuming the larger number dictates the sign in subtraction, or just flipping the order). This is by far the most common mistake for these kinds of problems when a negative answer is involved.
    *   **Computational Error:** Simple arithmetic mistake.
    *   **Understanding `y`:** Some might struggle with the very idea of an unknown.

Here's my estimation:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 10% full marks
competent: 50% full marks
advanced: 80% full marks
