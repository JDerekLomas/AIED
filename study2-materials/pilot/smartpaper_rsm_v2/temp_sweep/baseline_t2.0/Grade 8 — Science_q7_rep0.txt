This is a common question, and one we try to link to their everyday experiences (like seeing waste piles in their homes or fields). However, the English wording is a hurdle, and 'evaluate if this is beneficial' pushes it beyond simple recall.

Even if they understand a little, framing the answer in coherent English for *all parts* (change, reasons, benefits) is nearly impossible. They might say 'yes change', but struggle with 'reason' and 'beneficial'. They would also likely miss the nuance of *what* kind of change (decomposition).

A small percentage might understand the core idea of 'compost' or 'rotting' if taught explicitly with practical examples in Hindi. They might be able to say 'yes, it will change' and mention 'khad banti hai' (manure is formed). But connecting all three parts logically *in English* will be very hard for most. They'll likely use broken English or just point out one aspect. "Waste becomes dirt" or "plant food."

These students have a better grasp of English and the concept. They might say, "Yes, it decomposes," and then explain "bacteria/fungi break it down." For 'beneficial for soil health,' they'd likely mention "nutrients" or "makes soil fertile." The 'evaluate' part is the tricky bit, pushing them to articulate *how* it's beneficial. Some might miss specific scientific terms, but convey the general idea well.

advanced: 80% full marks
These students would be able to answer this comprehensively. They'd use terms like 'decomposition,' 'microorganisms,' 'humus,' 'nutrients,' and 'soil fertility.' They'd connect all three aspects logically and express it clearly in English. The 'evaluate' part would be easily tackled by them, articulating specific benefits like improved water retention or aeration.
