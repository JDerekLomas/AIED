Namaste bachho! Aaj hum Rajasthan ke baare mein kuch khaas baatein jaanenge. Rajasthan, jahaan humara school hai, wahan prakriti ne humein kuch anmol cheezein di hain, jinhe hum 'natural resources' kehte hain. Natural resources matlab woh cheezein jo humein kudrat se milti hain aur hamare kaam aati hain.

Ab sawal hai: Rajasthan mein paaye jaane wale koi bhi do prakritik sansadhan (natural resources) batao aur unmein se kisi ek ka logon ke jeevan par kya asar hota hai, woh samjhao.

**Scoring rubric:** Dho prakritik sansadhan batao (jaise pani, marble, copper, ret, namak, suraj ki roshni (solar energy), hawa (wind energy)). Maximum marks: 1

**Based on my experience, here's my assessment of the percentage of students scoring full marks:**

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** Many won't understand "natural resources" fully, or struggle to read and comprehend the question. Even if they know some resources, expressing them in English or explaining the influence will be hard.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall one or two but connecting it to "influences the lives" requires a basic understanding of cause-effect which is often difficult for them.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might just name one resource, name an artificial one, or struggle to elaborate on the 'influence'. Some might not even attempt due to language fear.

**basic:** 30% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** Many can identify key terms with some effort but writing full sentences or explaining abstract concepts can still be a challenge. They might mix Hindi and English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall 2-3 common resources like "water," "marble," "sand," "salt." They might struggle with "solar energy" or "wind energy" if not explicitly taught recently. They can probably explain the influence of water (drinking, farming) or marble (houses, buildings) in simple terms.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might forget to explain the influence of *one* of them, or provide a very superficial explanation. Spelling mistakes will be common.

**competent:** 70% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** They will mostly understand the question and attempt it in English. They might use simpler sentence structures but convey the meaning.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can easily name 2-3 resources like water, marble, sand, copper, salt, or even sun/wind for energy. They can clearly explain how water helps in agriculture, drinking, daily chores, or how marble is used in construction, or salt for food.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might pick a slightly less impactful resource for explanation or provide a good explanation but miss out on explicitly stating the second resource first. Some might struggle with technical terms if they haven't been revised recently.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** No major issues. They will frame proper sentences and use appropriate vocabulary.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will effortlessly name 2-3 diverse natural resources (e.g., water, copper, solar energy, marble) and provide a concise, well-explained impact of one on people's lives (e.g., "Water scarcity influences agricultural practices and necessitates the use of sustainable irrigation methods like drip irrigation," or "The extensive marble quarries provide employment to thousands and contribute significantly to the state's economy for construction material.").
*   **Common Mistakes:** Extremely rare for this specific item. Maybe a very minor grammatical error or picking two less common resources and struggling slightly to elaborate, but generally they will secure full marks.
