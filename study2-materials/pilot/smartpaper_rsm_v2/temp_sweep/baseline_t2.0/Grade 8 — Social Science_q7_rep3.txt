Okay, let's break this down from the perspective of an experienced teacher in an Indian government school, Class 8 Social Science, with these student demographics.

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"
*   **Scoring Rubric:** "For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." (Max score: 1)

**Key Considerations:**

1.  **Language Barriers:**
    *   The question is in English. A significant number of struggling and even some basic students will have difficulty fully comprehending the nuances of "contribute to the expansion" or "establishment of political dominance." They might pick up keywords like "Plassey," "British power," but struggle with the cause-and-effect relationship implied.
    *   They might recall isolated facts about Mir Jafar but fail to connect it to the broader concept of "political dominance."
    *   Many will likely attempt to answer in broken English or a mix of Hindi/English in their minds, which might make their conceptual understanding even more fragile.

2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:**
    *   The question *requires* both recall and a basic level of reasoning. Students need to recall what happened after Plassey (Mir Jafar, revenue, control) and then connect it to the idea of "expansion of British power."
    *   Simply stating "British won" or "Mir Jafar became nawab" is recall, but explaining *how that expanded British power* (by giving them control, resources, making him a puppet) requires a step of reasoning.

3.  **Specificity of the Required Answer:**
    *   The rubric specifically asks for "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This is quite specific. Just "British became more powerful" or "they got rich" might not quite hit the mark for full credit if the political dominance aspect over Bengal isn't clear.

4.  **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Incomplete answers:** Students might just say "British won" or "Mir Jafar became the king."
    *   **Focus on economic gain over political control:** They might focus on the right to collect revenue or "dastak" (duty-free trade) rather than the deeper political control aspect. While related, the rubric emphasizes political dominance.
    *   **Lack of linking words:** Even if they have the right ideas, they might struggle to express the "how" – the causal link. "Because," "due to," "leading to" are difficult.
    *   **Confusion with later events:** Some might mix up the results of Plassey with the Battle of Buxar or subsequent treaties, especially if their foundational understanding is weak.
    *   **Simply rewriting the question with minor changes.**

**Estimated Percentage of Students Scoring Full Marks (Based on Experience):**

*   **Struggling (35%):** I would expect very few, if any, to score full marks.
    *   They will struggle with the English in the question itself.
    *   Even if they understand parts, forming a coherent answer linking political dominance/puppet rule is beyond their current language and conceptual abilities. They might say "British won," or "Mir Jafar became Nawab," but not "how that contributed to *political dominance*."
    *   *Struggling: 0-2% full marks*

*   **Basic (35%):** Some might grasp the core idea but struggle with precise articulation.
    *   They might say "British made Mir Jafar the Nawab and got control of Bengal," which is close.
    *   They might get points for "Mir Jafar became a puppet," but struggle with the "political dominance" aspect explicitly. Their English might be just enough to convey the idea.
    *   They often get partial credit. For full marks, the explanation of "how" the puppet nawab led to "control/dominance" is crucial.
    *   *Basic: 10-15% full marks*

*   **Competent (20%):** These students are more likely to get it.
    *   They understand the question better and can formulate a more precise answer in English.
    *   They've likely grasped the concept of a "puppet ruler" and can connect it directly to British control over the resources and administration of Bengal.
    *   They can probably use terms like "political dominance" or "direct control."
    *   *Competent: 60-75% full marks*
