This is a common type of question that many of my students find challenging, even if the individual words are known. Let's break down how different groups would likely perform.

**struggling: 0% full marks**
For these students, the biggest hurdle isn't just word order, but often even recognizing all the words correctly, or understanding their individual meaning. They would struggle to recall the basic SVO structure, as their mental grammar framework in English is still very weak or non-existent. They might randomly put words together, perhaps focusing on starting with 'he' but then getting lost. Reading the prompt itself might be a barrier.

**basic: 10% full marks**
A small percentage of this group might get it right. They might recognize 'he' as a common subject and 'is' as a common verb. Some might have been explicitly taught this exact sentence or similar simple SVO structures through drilling. However, many would still struggle with the sequence, perhaps producing "He reading is a book" or "He is a book reading". The concept of a verb phrase like "is reading" is still abstract for many.

**competent: 70% full marks**
Most of these students would understand the core SVO structure. They've likely seen sentences like this before and have a developing sense of English sentence rhythm. They can identify the subject, the verb (even if it's 'is reading'), and the object. They would generally be able to arrange the words correctly.

**advanced: 100% full marks**
These students would easily get this correct. They have a good grasp of basic English sentence structure and would immediately identify 'He' as the subject and 'is reading a book' as the predicate. They likely understand the individual parts of speech well enough to know their typical placement in a sentence. This task is more of a quick recall and confirmation of existing knowledge for them, rather than a puzzle.
