This is a classic "recall" question, and while the definition isn't overly complex, the specific wording required for full marks will be a hurdle, especially with the mixed proficiency levels and Hindi-medium background.

Here's my breakdown:

**Thinking Process:**

*   **Language barriers:** "Fable" itself might be known (Akbar-Birbal, Panchatantra stories), but *defining* it in English, with specific keywords like "typically," "imparts," and "moral lesson," will be challenging for those with limited vocabulary. Many might give an example rather than a definition.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is 100% recall. They either know the definition or they don't. There's little room for deduction.
*   **Specificity:** The rubric is quite specific ("short story," "animals as characters," "imparts a moral lesson"). Missing any of these key elements, or phrasing them too broadly, would mean loss of marks.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Saying "story with animals" but omitting the "moral lesson."
    *   Saying "story with a moral" but omitting the "animals."
    *   Giving an example of a fable instead of defining it.
    *   Using incorrect grammar or incomplete sentences due to limited English.
    *   Mixing up "fable" with "folk tale" or "myth."
    *   Simply saying "fable means *kahani* (story)."

**Percentage Breakdown:**

Given the context, here's my prediction:

struggling: **0%** full marks (They would likely struggle to formulate even a partial answer in English, let alone one with all key components.)
basic: **5%** full marks (A few might recall most elements, but may miss a specific word like "typically" or struggle with sentence structure. They might get 0.5/1 if partially correct, but not full.)
competent: **40%** full marks (They have a better grasp of English and are more likely to have memorized such definitions. However, even within this group, some might miss a minor detail or have slight grammatical errors that cost them full marks according to a strict rubric.)
advanced: **85%** full marks (This group generally grasps new vocabulary and definitions well and has better retention. They are most likely to provide a precise, well-structured answer meeting all rubric requirements.)
