Here's my breakdown based on my experience:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
Even if they understand "y" is a variable, the English phrasing "Find the value of y in the equation" would be a major hurdle. Beyond that, the concept of negative numbers arising from a subtraction where the subtrahend is larger than the minuend (4-9) is very difficult for them. Many would try to do 9-4=5, or just get stuck once they move '9' to the other side. Some might even try to guess numbers, but the jump to negative five is rare.

**basic: 10% full marks**
A small percentage of this group, especially those who have recently had a good revision session on integers or equations, might get it. The biggest barrier would still be the English. If the question was read out in Hindi, or if they had seen many similar problems written out explicitly (e.g., "y Jama nau barabar chaar"), their chances would improve slightly. But solving for a negative integer without much experience with real-world contexts or repeated practice leads to common errors like $y=5$ or confusion.

**competent: 60% full marks**
This group would generally understand the concept of variables and basic equation solving. They would likely struggle initially with the English prompt, but would likely recognize the structure of a simple linear equation. Their common error would be arithmetic with negative numbers, either writing $y=5$ or $y=13$. However, a good chunk would accurately arrive at $y=-5$ through correct transposition and subtraction. Regular practice makes a difference here.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
This group would mostly understand the English phrasing. They would be comfortable with the concept of transposing terms in an equation and dealing with negative numbers. The question primarily tests recall of fundamental algebraic rules and arithmetic with integers, which they would have mastered. A tiny percentage might make a silly calculation mistake, but the method would be correct.
