This is a classic question, the kind that always throws a curveball, especially with such a diverse group of learners! Let's break down how my students would likely perform on this:

**Analysis of the Question and Challenges:**

*   **"Which line from the poem do you like the most..."**: This requires them to have *understood* the poem to some extent and to have formed an *opinion*. Many of my struggling students might just pick a line randomly if they haven't grasped the overall meaning.
*   **"...and why?"**: This is the real killer for many. It requires justification and the ability to articulate that justification in English.
    *   **Language Barrier:** Students might *know* why they like a line in their mother tongue (Hindi) but struggle immensely to translate that nuanced feeling or thought into simple English sentences. Their vocabulary for describing abstract emotions or insights might be very limited.
    *   **Reading Comprehension:** Even identifying a "line from the poem" accurately can be tough if reading is a struggle. They might copy half a line or invent something that sounds like a line.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily tests reasoning and personal connection after an initial comprehension. Recall is involved in getting the line right. The reasoning part is much harder.
    *   **Specificity:** The answer needs *both* the line and the reason. Missing either means no full marks. The "why" needs to be somewhat coherent.
    *   **Common Mistakes:**
        *   Just writing a line without a reason.
        *   Giving a very generic reason like "it is good" or "I like it" (which doesn't explain *why*).
        *   Stating a reason in Hindi or a very broken Hinglish that isn't understandable.
        *   Choosing a line but providing a reason that makes no sense in relation to the line.
        *   Simply summarizing the poem or parts of it instead of giving a specific reason for liking *one line*.

Given these challenges, here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
These students often struggle just to identify lines correctly. Even if they somehow manage to copy a line, articulating a "why" in English is far beyond their current expressive capabilities. They might write "achi line hai" (it's a good line) in Hindi or struggle even to formulate that.

**basic: 5% full marks**
A very small fraction here *might* manage this. They might pick a very simple, literal line (e.g., about a bird flying if it's a simple nature poem) and offer a very rudimentary "why" like "it is beautiful" or "I like birds." But it would likely be extremely simple and perhaps even a bit rote if it was a line discussed during class. The sophistication of linking emotion or meaning would be very rare. They often focus on completing one part of the question.

**competent: 50% full marks**
These students generally understand the poem at a basic to good level. They can identify a line and most likely have some connection to it. Their challenge will be expressing the "why" clearly and accurately in English. Some might offer simple but understandable reasons (e.g., "This line makes me feel happy because the poet talks about flowers"). They are more likely to attempt both parts of the question. Many will get close, scoring maybe 0.5 or 1.0, but just miss that full articulation.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
These students have a stronger grasp of English and better comprehension skills. They can understand the nuances of the poem and formulate their thoughts more effectively. They would be able to choose a line and articulate a clear, concise, and relevant reason in English. Even among them, 10% might stumble on vocabulary for a particularly abstract reason or just offer a slightly less detailed 'why' than needed for a perfect score.
