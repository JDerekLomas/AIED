This is a classic 'some/any' question that we tackle frequently in Class 6. Considering the student profile and the nature of the question:

*   **Language barriers:** While many students struggle with complex sentences, this sentence is relatively simple in structure. However, the meaning of 'some' and 'any' is what causes the hurdle. Many would simply guess or follow what they've heard more often. They might recognize "apples in the basket" but the nuanced difference between the determiners might be lost on a quick read for those who struggle with reading comprehension in English.

*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This primarily requires recall of the rule regarding 'some' for affirmative sentences and 'any' for questions/negations. However, for struggling students, it might feel more like arbitrary memorization than a reasoned application. Basic students might recall the rule but struggle with identifying an "affirmative sentence" implicitly. Competent and advanced students would definitely reason it out based on the rule.

*   **Specificity:** The answer is very specific and there's no room for partial credit if it's a fill-in-the-blank type question. If it's multiple choice, it's slightly easier. Assuming it's a fill-in-the-blank where they have to choose, the specificity is high.

*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Using 'any' in affirmative sentences, especially if they associate 'any' with plural nouns without fully grasping the positive/negative context.
    *   Guessing randomly.
    *   Confusion if they've only heard examples of "Are there *any* apples?" or "There aren't *any* apples." and might try to fit 'any' in even a positive statement.

Here's my estimation:

struggling: 10% full marks
basic: 40% full marks
competent: 85% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
