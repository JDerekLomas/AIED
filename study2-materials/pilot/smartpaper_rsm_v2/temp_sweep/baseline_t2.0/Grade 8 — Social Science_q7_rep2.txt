Okay, this is a very typical question for Class 8 Social Science, and one that highlights the challenges our students face. Let's break it down for the scoring and then estimate the percentages.

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"
*   **Rubric:** "For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." (Max score: 1)

**Key elements for full marks:**
1.  Connect Plassey to British *political dominance/control*.
2.  Mention *Bengal* (crucial for specificity).
3.  Possibly reference *Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab* (as an example of political control).

**Challenges for students:**

1.  **Language Barrier (Reading/Comprehension):** "Contribute to the expansion" might be challenging. They might understand "expansion" (failao), but "contribute" (yogdan) could be missed. The key is understanding the *causal link*.
2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires a direct recall of the *consequence* of Plassey, which is often taught as a pivotal event. However, it also implicitly asks for a brief explanation of *how* it contributed, which moves it slightly beyond pure recall into basic reasoning.
3.  **Specificity:** The need to mention "Bengal" and "political dominance/control" is critical. Many might remember "British became powerful" but miss the regional and political details.
4.  **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Simply stating "British won" or "Siraj-ud-Daulah lost." (No political consequence.)
    *   Saying "British got wealth" (which is true but not the *primary* political dominance).
    *   Confusion between Plassey and Buxar, or the later industrial expansion.
    *   Writing very general answers like "It helped the British to become rulers." (Lacking specificity of "Bengal" and "political dominance.")
    *   Inability to articulate the political consequences clearly due to language or conceptual gap.

**Estimated Percentage of Students Scoring Full Marks (Based on Experience):**

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   They will likely struggle to even understand the full question. If they do, they might just say "British won" or recall Siraj-ud-Daulah's name. They won't grasp the "contribute to the expansion of power" part meaningfully or link it to specific political dominance in Bengal.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   Many will know Plassey was important and that the British won. Some might even remember Mir Jafar. But the precise connection to "political dominance/control *over Bengal*" will be missed by most. A small percentage who understood the lesson well *and* can articulate it despite language barriers might get it. They're more likely to say "British became more powerful in India" rather than "political dominance in Bengal."

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   These students generally understand the key events and their significance. They would know about the British taking control and placing a puppet nawab. However, half of them might still struggle with the exact phrasing required by the rubric (e.g., using "political dominance" vs. "became powerful," or clearly stating "Bengal"). Language can still be a subtle barrier in precision.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   These students are comfortable with the content and can express themselves relatively well. They would likely know the outcome of Plassey led to direct political control over Bengal and the establishment of a puppet ruler like Mir Jafar. Their grasp of concepts and vocabulary (even if a bit rudimentary in English) allows them to meet the rubric's requirements. They usually pay attention to details like "Bengal."
