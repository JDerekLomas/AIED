Okay, thinking about my Class 7 students in a government school, especially with their backgrounds and varying English levels, this is how I'd break down the scores for the question "Describes the poet's writing style."

This question requires more than just recalling facts. It requires students to understand what "writing style" means, analyze the given text (which isn't provided here, but I'd assume they've recently read a poem), infer characteristics, and then use appropriate English vocabulary to describe it. This is a big hurdle for many.

Let's consider the specific difficulties:
*   **"Describes the poet's writing style"**: The phrase "writing style" itself can be tricky. Many will not understand it fully. They might understand "describe" but "writing style" is abstract.
*   **No specific poem given**: Assuming this question is asked *after* reading a particular poem. The context is crucial. My analysis below assumes they have recently read a poem (let's say something common, relatively simple like a poem about nature or everyday life).
*   **Vocabulary for "style"**: Even if they grasp the concept, finding a *suitable and relevant word* like "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct" requires a specific lexicon that many will lack. They might give adjectives that describe the *content* or *tone* rather than the *style*.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   They will likely struggle with understanding "writing style" completely. They might give an answer about what the poem is *about* (e.g., "The poet writes about trees"), or just one word from the poem that they understood. They definitely won't pick a word that describes the *style*. Many can't even read the question properly, let alone comprehend it and infer an answer.

**basic: 5% full marks**
*   Some might understand "describe" and try to give an adjective, but it's very likely to be an adjective describing the poem's content ("good," "sad," "happy") or the *effect* it had on them rather than the writing *style*. A very small number might, by chance or limited guidance (perhaps I gave an example word during class discussions), hit upon a vaguely appropriate word, but it would be rare. Their vocabulary for such abstract concepts is limited.

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   This group will largely understand "writing style" or at least try to interpret it. They might recall some common adjectives used to describe writing during class discussions (e.g., "simple" if I emphasized the poet used simple words). They are more likely to have a working vocabulary. However, many might still give words like "beautiful" or "nice" which are less about style and more about evaluation. The more articulate among them will hit it. If I specifically trained them with words like "simple" or "descriptive" and the poem allowed for it, this percentage could be higher, but generally, selecting an *appropriate* and *relevant* word for "style" is still a moderate challenge for half of them.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   This group will understand the question's intent. They possess a wider English vocabulary and stronger comprehension skills. They can analyze the poem for its structure, word choice, and sentence patterns, and deduce a fitting descriptor like "simple," "evocative," "direct," "figurative," or "narrative." They are also better at finding the precise word asked for in a rubric. They might not all get the *exact same* word, but most would pick a suitable and relevant one.

This is a high-cognitive-demand question for this cohort, relying heavily on inferential skills and specific vocabulary which are typically weak points.
