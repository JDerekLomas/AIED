This is a common task I would give, often after some scaffolding.

Here's my estimation of full marks based on the student demographics:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 20% full marks
competent: 70% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** Many students in this group struggle to form coherent sentences in English. They might understand "My favourite hobby" but providing the *when* and *why* consistently in a paragraph, with the correct grammatical structures, would be very challenging. They might write fragmented sentences or miss one of the required elements. Even identifying their 'favourite hobby' itself can sometimes be hard for them to articulate clearly in English, let alone elaborating. Some might just write "My hobby is play" without further detail.

*   **Basic (35% of class):** These students can often form simple sentences and might understand the individual components of the prompt (what, when, why). However, joining them into a *paragraph* with appropriate linking words and varied sentence structures is still a hurdle. They might write three separate sentences instead of a flowing paragraph, or miss one of the details. For example, "My favourite hobby is playing cricket. I play on Sunday. I like it because it is fun." – This is very basic, might get 0.5-0.75 depending on how strictly "complete paragraph" is interpreted for full marks. To get 1 mark, they need a bit more connection. They often make mistakes with prepositions and simple tense agreement.

*   **Competent (20% of class):** Students in this group generally have a better grasp of sentence structure and basic paragraph formation. They would likely attempt to address all three parts of the prompt and connect them somewhat smoothly. They might still make some grammatical errors, but the overall message would be clear and follow the paragraph structure. For example, "My favourite hobby is reading storybooks. I usually read in the evenings after completing my homework. I enjoy reading because it takes me to different worlds and helps me learn new words." – This would likely score full marks.

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** These students would have little trouble with this prompt. They can form complex sentences, use varied vocabulary, and easily construct a coherent and grammatically sound paragraph that addresses all aspects of the question. Their answers would be clear, concise, and flow well. They might even add a concluding thought or expand slightly beyond the minimum to demonstrate their proficiency.
