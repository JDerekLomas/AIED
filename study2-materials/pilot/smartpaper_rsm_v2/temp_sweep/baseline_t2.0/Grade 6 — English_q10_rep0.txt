Let's break this down.

This question tests a very basic rule of English grammar: 'some' is used in affirmative sentences, and 'any' in negative or interrogative sentences (questions). While it requires recall of a rule, it also implicitly requires the ability to understand the simple sentence structure.

**Challenges for students:**

*   **Reading comprehension:** Many struggling students will not be able to read and understand "There are (some/any) apples in the basket." as a whole unit. They might recognize 'apples' and 'basket', but the function words 'some/any' and the surrounding sentence structure might be a major hurdle.
*   **Vocabulary:** Even basic words like 'apples' and 'basket' are common, but the whole sentence requires understanding.
*   **Grammar rule application:** Even if they understand the sentence, remembering and applying the 'some/any' rule (affirmative vs. negative/interrogative) is often a weak point. They might guess based on sound or what they've heard without full understanding.
*   **Hindi influence:** Hindi speakers might struggle with the 'countable/uncountable' nuances sometimes associated with 'some/any', though for this particular sentence, it's more about affirmative/negative. However, direct translation or lack of a clear equivalent in their native language for such subtle distinctions can be an issue.
*   **Exposure:** While they might have heard 'some apples', the explicit choice between 'some' and 'any' and the underlying rule is often not internalized at this level without focused teaching.

**Considering each group:**

*   **Struggling (35%):** These students often cannot read simple sentences with full comprehension. Even if they recognize some words, the grammatical choice will be very hard. They will likely guess randomly.
    *   **Prediction:** I would be surprised if more than a handful got it right consistently. Many might get it right purely by chance.
    *   **struggling: 10% full marks** (This accounts for some lucky guesses, and perhaps one or two who might have been drilled specifically on this type of question.)

*   **Basic (35%):** These students can usually read simple sentences, though with some effort. They might recognize 'apples' and 'basket'. The structure "There are... in the basket" might be familiar. However, the rule of 'some' vs 'any' is still often fuzzy. They might choose based on what sounds more familiar (often 'some' as it's used more broadly in affirmative contexts). They might confuse it if they also learn about 'any' in "Do you have any apples?".
    *   **Prediction:** A good chunk would get this right if they have a decent intuitive grasp or recall of the basic rule, especially if it was recently taught. Some will still falter.
    *   **basic: 40% full marks** (They are starting to build this foundation, but inconsistency is high.)

*   **Competent (20%):** These students have a decent understanding of basic English structures. They would likely read and comprehend the sentence without difficulty. They should have been taught this basic grammar rule and would generally be able to apply it.
    *   **Prediction:** Most of these students would recall and apply the rule correctly. There might be an occasional error due to oversight or momentary confusion, but it would be rare.
    *   **competent: 85% full marks**

*   **Advanced (10%):** These students grasp English concepts quickly and often read independently. This type of grammar point would be well within their learned knowledge. They would correctly identify 'some' instantly as the sentence is affirmative.
    *   **Prediction:** They would almost all get this correct without hesitation.
    *   **advanced: 100% full marks** (I'd only give 95-98% if there was a possibility of a truly 'trick' question or fatigue, which isn't the case here.)
