Here's my assessment based on my experience:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Reasoning:** Students in this group often struggle even to read the sentence fluently, let alone understand the meaning of "adjective phrase." They might point to random words or guess. The concept of a "phrase" adds another layer of complexity they haven't typically mastered.

**basic: 5% full marks**
* **Reasoning:** A few students might *recognize* the word "tiny" as describing the bird, perhaps from previous lessons on adjectives (if it was recently covered). However, the "phrase" part is a huge hurdle. They would likely only identify "tiny" as an adjective, not as part of a phrase. A very bright and observant one in this group might make the connection by sheer luck or having heard it before, but it's rare.

**competent: 50% full marks**
* **Reasoning:** Students at this level *should* be able to identify "tiny" as an adjective. The challenge here is "adjective *phrase*." Some might recall that "a tiny" or "the tiny bird" *could* be considered a phrase in some contexts, or they might think of longer descriptive phrases. However, with just one word, the common misconception will be that "tiny" itself is the phrase. A significant number will correctly identify "tiny" as the adjective, but few will extend it correctly to an "adjective phrase" of just one word. Those who score full marks will have a good grasp of the distinction between an adjective and an adjective phrase, and will correctly identify "tiny" *as the phrase itself* in this specific instance where the phrase is just one word.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Reasoning:** These students would confidently identify "tiny" as an adjective. They would also understand the nuance that an adjective phrase can sometimes consist of a single adjective if it's functioning like a phrase modifying the noun. They have a stronger foundation in grammatical terminology and can apply it to specific examples. The only reason it's not 100% is that occasionally even advanced students can overthink or misinterpret what's expected for a single-word "phrase."
