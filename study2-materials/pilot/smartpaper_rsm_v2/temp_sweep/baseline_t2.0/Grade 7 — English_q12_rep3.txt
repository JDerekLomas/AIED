This is a very common type of question in government schools, especially for Class 7. While it might seem straightforward, the various challenges mentioned will significantly impact the success rate across different groups.

Here's my estimation:

*   **struggling: 0% full marks**
    *   **Reasons:** They will likely not understand the question "change into passive voice" at all, let alone the sentence itself. "Blown" is a tricky irregular verb form. They would struggle with reading the original sentence correctly. Many might just copy the original sentence or change a word or two without understanding voice.
*   **basic: 10% full marks**
    *   **Reasons:** This group might recognize "active voice" and "passive voice" as concepts, having been exposed to it, but the application will be difficult. They've likely memorized some rules or common sentence transformations, but the specific verb "blew/blown" is irregular and might trip them up. They might get the "The leaves..." part, but struggle with the correct auxiliary verb ("were") and the past participle ("blown"). Some might manage "The leaves were blow away" or "The leaves was blew away."
*   **competent: 60% full marks**
    *   **Reasons:** This group would have a good grasp of the active/passive voice rules for simple past tense. They understand the subject-object exchange and the use of 'be' + past participle. The irregular verb 'blown' is a key test here, and many will know it. They might make a small error like missing "by the wind" or incorrect tense if they are not careful, but generally, they should be able to transform it correctly.
*   **advanced: 95% full marks**
    *   **Reasons:** This group would find this question quite easy. They would not only understand the concept perfectly but also have a strong recall of irregular verb forms. The sentence structure is straightforward for them. The 5% error could come from a minor slip-up due to speed or overconfidence rather than a lack of understanding.
