This is a classic "recall" question, but the key challenge here isn't just memory; it's *comprehension* and *articulation* in English. Many of my students might have heard fables in Hindi (Panchatantra, Jataka tales), but connecting the term "fable" to that concept and defining it clearly in English is a different beast.

Here's my breakdown:

*   **Language barriers:** This is huge. "Typically uses animals as characters" – many might just write "animals." "Imparts a moral lesson" – they might say "gives a message" or "gives advice." "Short story" might become just "story." The *precision* required by the rubric is a high bar for their English expression.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is pure recall. If we've taught it and drilled it, they *might* remember. But "define" questions often assume a certain level of conceptual mastery and English fluency to phrase it correctly.
*   **Specificity of answer:** "Typically uses animals as characters" and "imparts a moral lesson" are the two critical components. Missing either means partial marks or zero. "Short story" adds to the precision but might be overlooked.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Not knowing the term "fable" itself, or confusing it with "story," "poem," or "folktale."
    *   Knowing *what* a fable is, but not being able to *express* it clearly in English. For example, "Animals talk and learn from mistakes." (Misses "moral lesson").
    *   Mentioning only one characteristic, e.g., "A story with animals." (Misses moral lesson).
    *   Trying to write examples instead of a definition.
    *   Grammatical errors and unclear sentences that obscure the meaning.

Here's my estimated percentage:

struggling: 0% full marks (They would likely struggle to understand the question, let alone formulate an answer.)
basic: 5% full marks (A few might remember keywords like "animal" and "moral" and string them together, perhaps with many errors, but get the gist. Most would get one component or be too vague.)
competent: 30% full marks (They'd understand the question and likely recall the key features. Their challenge would be expressing it concisely and accurately enough to meet the rubric's specific language.)
advanced: 70% full marks (They would generally recall the definition and have the English proficiency to articulate it well. Even here, 100% isn't guaranteed as some might miss "typically" or the precise phrasing of "imparts a moral lesson.")
