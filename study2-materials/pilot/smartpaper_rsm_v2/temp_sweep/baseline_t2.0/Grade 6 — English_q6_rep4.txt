Alright, as an experienced teacher in a government school, I've seen this kind of question many times. Let's break down how my Class 6 students would likely perform.

**Key Considerations for My Students:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The biggest hurdle. "Which line...do you like the most and why?" This involves understanding the question, recalling the poem, *choosing* a line (not just recalling one), and then *articulating a reason* in English.
*   **Reading Fluency:** A significant portion of the "struggling" and even "basic" groups might struggle to reread the entire poem to make an informed choice, especially if the poem isn't displayed prominently or they can't access it easily.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires *both*. They need to recall lines from the poem AND apply critical thinking/personal preference (reasoning). Many might just recall *any* line if they can't manage the "liking" part.
*   **Abstract Thinking:** "Why do you like it?" requires explaining an abstract concept (preference/emotion). For many Hindi-medium students, this is harder than describing concrete objects or actions.
*   **Sentence Construction:** Even if they pick a line and have a reason in mind, forming a grammatically correct English sentence for the "why" part is a huge challenge. They might say something simple and incomplete.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Not quoting a line, just describing something from the poem.
    *   Quoting a line but providing no "why."
    *   Providing a very vague "why" like "it is good" or "I like it."
    *   Using incorrect English that makes their reason unclear.
    *   Simply stating the title or the author instead of a line.

Here's my breakdown for the scoring:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*Why:* These students typically struggle with reading comprehension and sentence formation. Even if they somehow picked a line, explaining *why* they liked it in coherent English would be almost impossible. They might just write "good" or repeat part of the question. Their answers would lack both the specific line and a clear reason.

**basic: 5% full marks**
*Why:* A very small fraction here *might* succeed. They can usually read simple sentences and understand basic questions. They might pick a very simple, direct line. However, the "why" is the stumbling block. They might offer a one or two-word reason that might be *accepted* as an attempt at reasoning if the teacher is very generous (e.g., "It is nice" or "It is beautiful"). But achieving the specificity needed for *full* marks (a clearly stated line + a logical, understandable reason) would be rare. Many would likely pick a line and provide a generic, unclear "why," getting partial credit.

**competent: 50% full marks**
*Why:* This group has a fair chance. They can read the poem, identify lines, and understand the question. The challenge remains the *articulation of the reason*. Many would pick a line and provide a valid reason, but the grammar might be slightly off, or the reason might be a bit simplistic. However, it would be comprehensible. For instance, "I like the line 'The birds sang sweetly' because it makes me happy." This is clear and fits the rubric. They are likely to hit both parts: a line AND a reason, even if the English isn't perfect.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*Why:* These students generally excel in all aspects. They would understand the nuances of the question, select a well-chosen line, and articulate a clear, thoughtful reason using correct English. They often enjoy demonstrating their understanding. The 10% not getting full marks might be due to a rare moment of oversight, misreading the question slightly, or providing a reason that isn't quite specific enough but still comprehensible. For example, "I like the line 'The sun shone bright' because it talks about nature" – which is acceptable, but not as rich as "it paints a picture of a clear morning." They would definitely hit both elements of the rubric.
