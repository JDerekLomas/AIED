This is a common question, and one I've thought about often! Here's my breakdown for a Class 7 English poetry question like "Describes the poet's writing style":

**Struggling (35% of class): 0% full marks**
*   **Language barrier:** Most wouldn't understand "describes," "poet's," or "writing style" fully. They might recognize individual words but struggle with the meaning of the phrase as a whole.
*   **Reasoning vs. Recall:** This is definitely reasoning. They haven't been taught a list of writing styles to recall. They need to observe the text and infer. This is a very high-level task for them.
*   **Common mistakes:** They would either leave it blank, copy a random line from the poem, or write a single English word that has no relevance (e.g., "nice," "good").

**Basic (35% of class): 5% full marks**
*   **Language barrier:** Some might get the gist of "writing style" with context clues or if we've discussed it recently, but it's still a conceptual hurdle. They might confuse it with "topic" or "message."
*   **Reasoning vs. Recall:** This still requires observation and inference. They might pick up on very obvious elements if the poem is exceptionally simple and uses common words.
*   **Common mistakes:** Many would try to answer but struggle with vocabulary. They might write "poem is good" or "easy to understand." If they've been taught a very basic concept like "simple language," a tiny percentage *might* try that if the poem strongly fits. "Simple" would be their most likely successful attempt.

**Competent (20% of class): 50% full marks**
*   **Language barrier:** They would generally understand the question.
*   **Reasoning vs. Recall:** They can observe aspects like vocabulary (simple/difficult), sentence structure (direct/complex), or use of imagery. They might pick "simple" if it is, or "descriptive" if there are clear examples. They might also pick up on tone, like "informal."
*   **Common mistakes:** Some might describe the *content* of the poem rather than the style (e.g., "the poet writes about nature" instead of "the poet uses descriptive language"). Others might have the right idea but lack the precise vocabulary (e.g., "the poet uses a lot of words to show things" instead of "descriptive").

**Advanced (10% of class): 85% full marks**
*   **Language barrier:** No issue with understanding the question.
*   **Reasoning vs. Recall:** They are more likely to pick up on nuances. They can usually identify words like "simple," "direct," "descriptive," "informal," or "evocative" and support it mentally.
*   **Common mistakes:** A few might choose a less precise word than ideal, or miss a slightly more insightful descriptor, but they would generally get a relevant answer. For example, they might say "easy to read" instead of "simple" or "direct," which is still correct.

**Overall Reflection:**

This question is difficult because "writing style" is an abstract concept that requires inferential thinking and a specific vocabulary to articulate. For most of my students, their focus is still on understanding the literal meaning of the poem. Expressing *how* something is written, rather than *what* is written, is a big leap. We'd have to scaffold this kind of question extensively with explicit teaching and examples over several sessions for more students to grasp it.
