Namaste, mere pyaare bachchon! Aaj hum dekhenge ki kitne bachche Harappan Civilization ke sheheron ki khaas baat bata paayenge. (Hello, my dear children! Today we'll see how many students can describe a special feature of Harappan Civilization cities.)

Ye question Harappan Civilization ki nagar yojna (urban planning) ke ek khaas feature ko puchta hai. Ye direct recall par आधारित है (It relies on direct recall). Maine yeh topic class mein padhaya hai aur Hindi aur English dono mein samjhaya hai. Humne pictures bhi dekhe the. Lekin bachchon ki English comprehension aur recalling power vary karti hai.

**struggling: 5% full marks**
* **Reasoning:** These students often struggle with reading English text. Even if they know the answer in Hindi, phrasing it correctly in English can be very difficult. They might remember "nayi-nayi baatein" (new things) or "safai" (cleanliness) but articulating "advanced drainage system" or "grid layout" would be a big challenge. They might also confuse Harappa with other civilizations.

**basic: 25% full marks**
* **Reasoning:** These students would likely recognize keywords like "Harappa" and "urban planning." They might remember *one* key feature like "achhi naaliyan" (good drains) or "pakki eentein" (baked bricks). The challenge will be expressing it accurately and completely in English. They might write "good drains" instead of "advanced drainage system" which might get partial marks, but for full marks, they need to be more specific. They might get the main idea but not the technical terms.

**competent: 70% full marks**
* **Reasoning:** These students have a decent grasp of English and usually pay attention in class. They would recall one of the major features like "grid pattern of streets," "advanced drainage system," or "use of baked bricks." Their ability to structure a coherent English sentence, even if simple, would allow them to score full marks. They might still make minor grammatical errors but the core concept would be clear and correct.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
* **Reasoning:** These students generally excel in all subjects. Their English comprehension is good, and they can articulate their thoughts well. They would not only recall a key feature but likely elaborate slightly, for example, "The cities were divided into a citadel and a lower town, and the streets were laid out in a perfect grid pattern." They are good at identifying key terms and explaining them concisely.
