This is a classic sentence rearrangement task, fundamental for understanding basic English sentence structure. Given the student profiles, here's my breakdown:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   They would find reading and understanding each individual word a significant challenge.
*   The concept of 'subject-verb-object' is likely not internalized. They might recognize 'book' as a thing, and 'reading' as an action, but putting them in the correct sequence, especially with 'is' and 'he', would be very difficult.
*   Common mistakes would include just listing the words as given, or trying to match a word to the start or end without full comprehension. They might form 'book is reading he a' or similar fragmented structures.

**basic:** 30% full marks
*   They can probably read most of the individual words.
*   They might recognize 'he' as a person and 'book' as an object, and 'reading' as an action.
*   However, the position of 'is' (auxiliary verb) might confuse them. They might struggle between "He reading a book is" or "He a book reading is".
*   Those who have encountered simple present continuous sentences before will likely succeed, but without strong reinforcement, it will still be a guessing game for many.

**competent:** 80% full marks
*   They will understand the meaning of each word and the concept of a sentence.
*   They have likely been taught simple sentence structures (SVO).
*   They would recognize 'he' as the subject and 'reading' as the main action, and know that 'is' typically comes after the subject in such a construction. The 'a book' chunk would naturally follow.
*   Occasional mistakes might happen due to oversight or a moment of confusion, but generally, they will get this right.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   This task is well within their current capabilities.
*   They would immediately recognize the structure required for a present continuous sentence.
*   It's a very straightforward application of known grammatical rules for them. The only reason for a small deduction would be a rare error in transcription or a lapse in concentration, not a lack of understanding.
