This is a great question to reflect on the practicalities of teaching in such a setting!

Here's my breakdown of how students would likely perform:

The question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason" requires a combination of comprehension and reasoning, going beyond simple recall. The phrase "in real life" also pushes students to make a connection beyond the story.

Here's my estimation for each group:

*   **struggling:** **0-5% full marks**
    *   **Language barriers:** Many would struggle just to decode "Do you think... important in real life? Give one reason." They might latch onto "king" and "questions" but not grasp the nuance.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires more reasoning. Even if they recall the questions, connecting them to "real life" and then articulating a "reason" in English is a significant hurdle.
    *   **Specificity:** "Any valid reason" is good, but for them, articulating *any* reason coherently is hard.
    *   **Common mistakes:**
        *   Misunderstanding the question entirely and giving an unrelated answer or just "Yes."
        *   Being unable to form a complete sentence to express their reason.
        *   Giving a reason related only to the story, not "real life."
        *   Simply writing "yes" or "no" without a reason.

*   **basic:** **20-30% full marks**
    *   **Language barriers:** Many in this group might understand the question, perhaps with some struggle or rereading. They might understand "important in real life."
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can usually recall the king's three questions. The jump to "real life" and articulating a simple reason is where they will face difficulty. Some might be able to offer a very short, simple reason.
    *   **Specificity:** They might struggle to phrase a clear "valid reason" in English, even if they have a rough idea. They might give very short, incomplete sentences.
    *   **Common mistakes:**
        *   Stating "Yes" and then providing a very weak or general reason ("it is good," "it helps us").
        *   Their reason might be loosely connected but not clearly articulated.
        *   One-word answers or fragmented sentences for the reason.
        *   Copying a phrase from the text, even if it's not a direct *reason* for its importance in real life.

*   **competent:** **60-70% full marks**
    *   **Language barriers:** They would mostly understand the question and the vocabulary used.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall the questions. They are more capable of making the leap to "real life" implications. They can often articulate a reason, perhaps simply but effectively.
    *   **Specificity:** They will likely be able to give a valid, coherent reason, even if it's not highly elaborate. For example: "Yes, because knowing the right time helps us to succeed" or "Yes, because knowing right people helps us choose friends."
    *   **Common mistakes:**
        *   Sometimes their reason might be a little general but still valid.
        *   Minor grammatical errors in their answer, but the meaning is clear.

*   **advanced:** **90-100% full marks**
    *   **Language barriers:** No issues here. They will understand the question immediately.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They grasp the connection to "real life" readily and can quickly formulate a logical reason.
    *   **Specificity:** They will provide a clear, concise, and valid reason. They might even offer more sophisticated reasons like "They help us make better decisions for a happier and more successful life" or "These questions teach us to be mindful and choose our actions wisely."
    *   **Common mistakes:** Extremely rare, perhaps a minor phrasing choice that's less elegant but still conveys the full meaning.

**In summary:** The core challenge isn't just recalling the questions, but the analytical step of connecting them to "real life" and then articulating that connection with a "reason" in English. For struggling and basic learners, each of these steps presents a significant hurdle.
