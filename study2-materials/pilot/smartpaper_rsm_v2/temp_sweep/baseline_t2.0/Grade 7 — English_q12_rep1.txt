This is a great question that hits at the heart of the challenges in a mixed-ability, multi-lingual classroom.

Here's my breakdown based on experience:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** These students likely can't even decode "blew" or "away" consistently. "Passive voice" is an alien concept. They're at the stage of understanding basic present/past tense verbs, not voice transformation.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires a specific set of grammatical rules and understanding of subject-object inversion, plus correct verb form. They lack both the recall of rules and the reasoning skills in English.
*   **Common mistakes:** They'd likely just repeat parts of the sentence, perhaps get "leaves" and "wind" mixed up, or try to change a few words randomly. They might say something like "Leaves wind blew" or "Away leaves wind blew."

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Some can read the sentence, but understanding "blew" as the past tense of "blow" might be an issue for a few. "Passive voice" as a term might be vaguely familiar, but applying it consistently is hard.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They *might* recall a very simplified pattern if they've been taught it recently ("object comes first, add 'was/were', then the past participle"). However, recalling "blown" as the past participle of "blow" will be a major stumbling block for many. Most might try "were blowed" or just "were blow."
*   **How specific:** The requirement of the correct past participle ("blown") is very specific and where most will fail. They might get the "The leaves were..." part.
*   **Common mistakes:** "The leaves were blowed away by the wind," "The leaves were blow away by the wind," or they might try to turn "blew" into another simple past tense construction incorrectly.

**competent: 60% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They will read and understand the sentence perfectly. They will have been exposed to the concept of active/passive voice, probably even in their Hindi-medium background in their native language grammar.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They will likely recall the general rules of passive voice. The key challenge for them will be recalling the *correct irregular past participle* of "blow." Many might hesitate or incorrectly choose "blowed."
*   **How specific:** "Blown" is the hinge point. If they've practiced irregular verbs adequately, they'll get it.
*   **Common mistakes:** Still "The leaves were blowed away by the wind," or forgetting "by the wind" (though the rubric includes it). Some might forget "away."

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issues here.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They will know the rules for passive voice conversion thoroughly. They will have a strong recall of common irregular verb forms, including "blow-blew-blown."
*   **How specific:** They're likely to get "blown" correct without an issue.
*   **Common mistakes:** A very rare lapse of concentration might lead to forgetting "away" or "by the wind," but generally, they will execute this correctly. They are likely to understand the subtle nuance of retaining the adverb "away."
