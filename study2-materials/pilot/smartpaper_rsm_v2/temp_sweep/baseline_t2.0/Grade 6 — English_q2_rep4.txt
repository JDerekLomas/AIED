This is a great question that really makes me think about my students!

**Analysis:**

*   **Language barriers:** "Who lived inside the book?" is a fairly straightforward Wh-question. The core words "who," "lived," "inside," and "book" are likely recognized by most, even those struggling. The challenge comes more from decoding the actual *text* they'd have to read to find the answer. Assuming this question refers to a *specific text* we've read, then accessing that text and understanding its content in English is the hurdle.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is 100% recall. They need to remember a specific detail from a specific story. No reasoning or inference is required.
*   **Specificity of answer:** "A magical fairy" or "fairy" are quite specific. There's not much room for variance. If the story had other characters, "a girl" or "a boy" would be incorrect, making the answer very particular.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Misunderstanding "who":** Some struggling students might focus on "what" or "where" if they haven't fully grasped "who."
    *   **Recalling incorrect detail:** Even if they understood "who," they might recall another character if the story had multiple or if they conflated it with another story.
    *   **Difficulty articulating in English:** They might *know* the answer in Hindi but struggle to form "a magical fairy" in English. They might just say "fairy" or point to an image.
    *   **Copying errors:** If the text is available, they might copy it, but struggle with spelling "magical" or "fairy."

Given all this, here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   These students will likely struggle with decoding the text to find the answer. Even if they heard the story, recalling a specific detail like "magical fairy" and articulating it correctly in English is a significant challenge for them. They might remember *something* but won't hit the precise phrasing.

**basic: 20% full marks**
*   Some of these students would recall the answer if the story was very recently read or a prominent part of discussion. They might get "fairy" but miss "magical," or might spell "fairy" incorrectly. The 20% accounts for those who successfully recall *and* manage to write it accurately enough (allowing for "fairy" or a slight spelling error that is clearly identifiable).

**competent: 70% full marks**
*   These students generally have better recall and stronger vocabulary. They would likely remember "fairy" and often "magical." Their spelling would also be more reliable. The 30% who don't score full marks might misspell one word, or recall another less prominent detail.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   These students typically excel at recall and English articulation. They would almost certainly know the answer and write it correctly. The 5% accounts for potential human error, a moment of confusion, or a very rare spelling slip-up.
