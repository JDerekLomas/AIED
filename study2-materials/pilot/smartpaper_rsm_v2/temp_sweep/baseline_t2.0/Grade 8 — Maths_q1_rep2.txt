Let's break down this problem for my Class 8 students in an Indian government school, keeping all the factors in mind.

The equation is `y + 9 = 4`. We need to find the value of `y`.

**Thought Process:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The problem statement "Find the value of `y` in the equation: `y + 9 = 4`" might be a hurdle for some Hindi-medium students. However, the numbers and symbols are universal. The core instruction "Find the value of `y`" (`y` का मान ज्ञात कीजिए) would likely be understood even if the student doesn't perfectly comprehend "equation."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This problem primarily requires reasoning, specifically the understanding of balancing an equation. It's about inverse operations – to isolate `y`, you need to undo the `+9`.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The answer `-5` is very specific. No partial credit for nearly right answers like `5` or `13`.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Ignoring Negative Numbers:** Many students struggle with operations involving negative numbers. `4 - 9` is a common source of error, leading to `5` instead of `-5`. They might correctly perform `9 - 4` and forget the sign rule or context.
    *   **Additive Inverse Concept:** The core idea is to subtract 9 from both sides. Some might just move the 9 without changing its sign or operate incorrectly.
    *   **Arithmetic Error:** Simple subtraction error (e.g., `9-4=13` or similar absurdities, less common but present).
    *   **Confusing sides:** Adding 9 to the right side (4+9 = 13) instead of subtracting.

Now, let's estimate the percentages for each group:

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   Many of these students will still be trying to grasp the concept of variables and equations.
    *   The `+9` on the left might confuse them. They might try `4 + 9 = 13` or even `9 - 4 = 5` without understanding which number should be subtracted from which.
    *   The negative result (`-5`) will be a major stumbling block for a large chunk of this group. They might get `5` as an answer but struggle to justify it.
    *   **Estimation:** 5% full marks (Perhaps a lucky guess, or a student who, despite general struggle, has understood this *very specific* concept and arithmetic for some reason, maybe through extra effort for this particular problem type).

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   These students generally understand what a variable is and the concept of an equation *if* it leads to a positive whole number answer.
    *   They know that `9` needs to "go" to the other side. However, the operation `4 - 9` will be where many stumble.
    *   They might get `y = 5` as a common error, forgetting or struggling with the rules of subtracting a larger number from a smaller one.
    *   **Estimation:** 40% full marks (Those who grasp integer operations will get it, others will fall into the `y=5` trap).

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   These students have a fair understanding of inverse operations and solving simple linear equations.
    *   They are more likely to correctly perform `4 - 9`.
    *   Minor arithmetic errors or occasional sign errors *can* still happen, but less frequently.
    *   **Estimation:** 85% full marks (Most will get this, a few might make a careless error).

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulation and integer operations.
    *   This problem is straightforward for them.
    *   The only reason for not getting full marks would be a very rare careless mistake.
    *   **Estimation:** 95% full marks (Highly likely to get it right).

**Final Answer:**

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 40% full marks
competent: 85% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
