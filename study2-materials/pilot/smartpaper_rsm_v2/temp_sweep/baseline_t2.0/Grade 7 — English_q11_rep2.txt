This question is tricky because it asks for an "adjective *phrase*", but the provided sentence only contains a single adjective ("tiny"). The scoring rubric also states, "The student correctly identifies "tiny" as an adjective." This discrepancy needs to be considered.

If the question truly intends to identify *just* the adjective "tiny" despite asking for an "adjective phrase," it becomes a recall task of identifying a descriptor. If students *must* identify a "phrase," then the correct answer is that there isn't an adjective phrase in the conventional sense, or they might try to combine "a tiny" which isn't an adjective phrase. Given the context of a Class 7 English student from an economically weaker background with limited English proficiency, assuming they need to *only* identify "tiny" as the answer for full marks, as per the rubric, is the most practical interpretation.

Here's my breakdown based on that interpretation (identifying "tiny"):

*   **Struggling (35%):** These students often struggle with reading comprehension in English. Even simple vocabulary might be a barrier. They might identify *a* word, but not necessarily the correct one, or they might simply stare blankly. They often don't differentiate between parts of speech confidently. The word "tiny" itself might not be readily understood as a describing word.
    *   **Likely score full marks:** They might guess correctly if they associate 'describing something' with one of the words, but the conceptual understanding of 'adjective' would be weak. If I guide them to look for 'what kind of bird?', some might get it. But on their own, the chances are low.
    *   struggling: **10%** full marks (Likely due to a lucky guess or prior specific instruction on "describing words").

*   **Basic (35%):** These students have a foundational understanding but often make errors. They might understand "adjective" as a "describing word" but struggle to apply it consistently or quickly in sentences. "Tiny" is a relatively common word, so they might know its meaning. However, if they get confused by "phrase," they might pick two words or get flustered. Assuming they only need to pick "tiny":
    *   **Likely score full marks:** They probably know what an adjective is in isolation, but finding it in a sentence with other words could be challenging. Many will try to apply their definition and might land on "tiny."
    *   basic: **40%** full marks (They will get "tiny" due to recall of "describing words" but some might overthink due to "phrase" if the instruction isn't clearly simplified).

*   **Competent (20%):** These students have a decent grasp of English grammar and vocabulary. They know what an adjective is and can usually identify it. "Tiny" is well within their vocabulary. The "phrase" aspect might give a moment's pause, but they would likely conclude that there isn't a *phrase* and just identify the adjective as the closest thing, especially given a lenient rubric for identifying "tiny."
    *   **Likely score full marks:** They can identify adjectives reliably. The "phrase" part might confuse a few for a moment, leading to hesitation, but most would pick "tiny" as the best fit given the instruction to identify an adjective, or if they correctly determine there isn't a *phrase* but *just* an adjective.
    *   competent: **85%** full marks

*   **Advanced (10%):** These students have a strong command of English. They would immediately identify "tiny" as the adjective. They would also likely note the absence of a proper adjective phrase (like "very tiny" or "tiny and colourful"). Depending on how strictly they interpret "phrase" in the question versus the leniency implied by the rubric for just "tiny," they might either give "tiny" or state there isn't an adjective *phrase*. If the goal is "tiny," they will achieve it.
    *   **Likely score full marks:** They understand parts of speech and sentence structure very well.
    *   advanced: **95%** full marks

**Summary based on the rubric stating "identifies 'tiny' as an adjective":**

struggling: 10% full marks
basic: 40% full marks
competent: 85% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
