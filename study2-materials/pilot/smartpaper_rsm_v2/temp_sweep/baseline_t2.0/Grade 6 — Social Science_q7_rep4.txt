Namaste, bacho! Aayiye, dekhte hain ki hamare Rajasthan mein kaun-kaun se kudrati khazane milte hain, aur unka hamare jeevan par kya asar padta hai.

First, let's understand the question in simple Hindi: "Rajasthan mein koi do prakritik sansadhan (natural resources) batao. Aur phir unme se kisi ek ka naam lekar batao ki woh Rajasthan ke logon ki zindagi ko kaise prabhavit (influences) karta hai."

**Common Mistakes & Challenges:**

*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Many struggling and even basic students will get stuck on words like "natural resources," "influences," and even "explain." They might know the *concepts* but struggle to understand the question itself in English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Identifying two resources is recall. Explaining the influence requires some basic reasoning and descriptive ability, which is harder.
*   **Specificity:** Just saying "minerals" won't be enough. They need to name *specific* minerals or resources.
*   **Connecting Cause & Effect:** Students might list water and then just say "it's important." They need to explain *how* it influences lives (e.g., for farming, drinking, industries).
*   **General Knowledge:** Some students might know general facts about Rajasthan but struggle to link them directly to "natural resources" if the term is new or confusing in English.
*   **Writing in English:** Even if they understand, expressing the answer clearly in English is a major challenge for many. They might use a mix of Hindi and English, or provide very short, incomplete sentences.

**Scoring Distribution (Estimated):**

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*(They will struggle to even understand the question. If prompted in Hindi, they might name one resource but fail to explain its influence meaningfully due to language and descriptive limitations.)*

**basic:** 10% full marks
*(Some might understand enough to name two resources, like water and sand. Explaining the influence might be very basic, like "Water is for drinking" or "Sand is in the desert." Only a small percentage will connect it properly to livelihood or lifestyle. Many will only get one part right, or offer very vague explanations.)*

**competent:** 60% full marks
*(Most will be able to name two resources correctly (e.g., water, marble, copper, sunlight). A good portion will be able to explain the influence of one resource reasonably well, using simple English sentences, perhaps with some grammatical errors but conveying the meaning. They can connect water to agriculture, or marble to industries/housing.)*

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*(They will understand the question clearly, identify two relevant resources without difficulty, and explain the influence of one with good clarity and structure, demonstrating a solid grasp of the concept and sufficient English proficiency.)*
