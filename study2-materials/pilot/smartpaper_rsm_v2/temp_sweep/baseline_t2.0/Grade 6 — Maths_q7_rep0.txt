Here's my breakdown of how my students would perform on this question, keeping all those factors in mind:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Many struggling students would likely not even understand what the question is asking in English. They might pick out isolated words like "temperature," "Jodhpur," "hour," but putting it all together for comprehension would be very difficult.
*   **Reasoning:** Even if they somehow got the gist, the multi-step reasoning (time elapsed, then multiplication/addition) would be beyond most.
*   **Common Mistakes:** If they attempted it, they might just add $30 + 2$, or guess wildly. Many might get stuck trying to convert "10 am to 4 pm" into hours. Counting on fingers for a duration across noon can be surprisingly challenging for some struggling students.

**basic: 25% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Many in this group would struggle with the English, but *some* might grasp the core idea if given extra time to read or if a peer helps them interpret. They're starting to build a vocabulary, but complex sentence structures still trip them up.
*   **Reasoning:** They can handle basic addition and multiplication. The difficulty comes from *identifying* the steps. The biggest challenge for them would be calculating the time difference (10 am to 4 pm). Some might count incorrectly or forget about the transition through 12 pm. If they manage the time elapsed, the rest might follow.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Incorrectly calculating elapsed time (e.g., $4-10 = -6$, or thinking $4$ o'clock is *just* $4$ hours later). Simple arithmetic errors if they're rushing.

**competent: 70% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Most competent students would understand the English reasonably well. They might need a moment to process or reread, but the core meaning would get through.
*   **Reasoning:** They have the conceptual understanding of time duration and rate problems. They'd likely use a combination of mental counting (10 to 11, 11 to 12, 12 to 1, etc.) or simple subtraction (10-4=6 for those confident with negative or modulus implicitly). They know to multiply the rate by the duration and then add to the initial temperature.
*   **Common Mistakes:** A few might still make a small error in counting the hours (e.g., forgetting to count 12 to 1 as 1 hour) leading to 5 or 7 hours instead of 6. However, they usually catch these types of mistakes.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here. They'd read and comprehend the question quickly.
*   **Reasoning:** They'd mentally (or with a quick scribble) calculate the elapsed time as 6 hours effortlessly. They'd then perform $6 \times 2 = 12$ and $30 + 12 = 42$. It's a straightforward multi-step problem for them.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Extremely rare, perhaps a slip of the pen or an absent-minded arithmetic error, but they are usually very precise with these kinds of questions.
