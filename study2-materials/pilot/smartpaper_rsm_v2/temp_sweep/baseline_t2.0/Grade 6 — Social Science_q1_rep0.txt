Alright, let's break this down. As an experienced teacher here, I've seen these kids in action many times.

Here's my estimation for full marks on this question (0.5 out of 0.5):

struggling: **0%** full marks
basic: **5%** full marks
competent: **60%** full marks
advanced: **90%** full marks

Let me explain my reasoning:

*   **Language barriers:** "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." Even this simple sentence is a hurdle. Many of my struggling students won't grasp "major," "mountain ranges," or "located." They might understand "India" and "two," but the core subject will be lost. The sheer effort of decoding the English often overshadows the content.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question is pure recall. It requires them to have learned, understood, and retained the names of these features. There's no critical thinking or analysis involved.
*   **Specificity of the required answer:** They need to name *two* specific mountain ranges. Not just "mountains," but *ranges*. This is where precision matters.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Struggling students:** Will likely write "hills" or "mountains" in Hindi or English if they write anything. They might write the name of a local hill or famous mountain peak they know (like Everest, even though it's not *fully* in India, but their general knowledge might point to a big mountain). They won't grasp "range."
    *   **Basic students:** A small percentage might recall "Himalayas" because it's so prominent. But recalling a *second* one (like Aravalli, Vindhya, or Western Ghats) is often a struggle. They might mix up rivers with mountains, or state names with geographical features. They might also give only one answer instead of two.
    *   **Competent students:** They would generally recall the Himalayas and one or two other major ones. Their reading comprehension of the English would be sufficient.
    *   **Advanced students:** These students typically grasp the concepts quickly, have good recall, and are often better at reading English despite the Hindi medium background. They've likely paid attention in class and remembered at least two.

**Detailed Breakdown of each group:**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   **0% full marks:** They simply won't understand the question well enough to provide two specific names of mountain *ranges*. They might write "Pahad" (mountain in Hindi) or even just "Bharat" (India) out of confusion. They wouldn't even get 0.5 marks as they wouldn't likely provide one correct name that aligns with "mountain range."

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   **5% full marks:** This is a small group within the basic category that might have memorized "Himalayas" and perhaps one other like "Aravalli" during our revision sessions. Many of this group might write only "Himalayas" (scoring 0), or just "Himalaya," which depending on the exact rubric could be counted as one, but they would miss the second. Or they might name one correct and one incorrect. The difficulty is consistently naming *two*.

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   **60% full marks:** These students usually grasp the core concepts taught. They've made an effort to learn the major physical features. They'd likely write "Himalayas" and then one of "Aravalli," "Vindhya," "Satpura," or "Western Ghats." Their English reading skills, while not perfect, are usually good enough to understand the prompt. The remaining 40% might forget one, or misspell severely enough to make it ambiguous, or make a minor error that costs them full marks.

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   **90% full marks:** These are my go-getters. They pick things up fast. They would definitely know at least two, if not more, major mountain ranges. Their English comprehension is usually solid. The remaining 10% might be a fluke- one bad day, a moment of confusion, or a simple oversight, but it would be rare.

This type of recall question, while seemingly straightforward to an English speaker, is quite challenging for my students, particularly with the added layer of language. We work extensively on keywords and visual aids for such topics.
