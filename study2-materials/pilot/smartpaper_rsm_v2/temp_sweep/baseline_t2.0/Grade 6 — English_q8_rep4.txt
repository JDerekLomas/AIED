This is a good item to assess basic sentence structure. Given the student demographics and learning levels, here's my breakdown of expected performance:

*   **struggling:** **10% full marks**
    *   *Reasoning:* These students often struggle with reading individual words, let alone understanding their meaning or order. Many would attempt to just write the words as they appear or produce a very broken sentence. They might remember *'He'* comes first, but the 'is reading a book' part might still be scrambled due to lack of exposure and practice with this specific sentence structure. Some might get lucky or remember a similar sentence from a basic lesson.

*   **basic:** **50% full marks**
    *   *Reasoning:* These students have some grasp of basic English. They might be able to identify common subject pronouns like 'he'. They might recall the typical SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure if they've had sufficient practice with simple present continuous sentences. However, some might still mix up 'a book reading is' or other variations if they don't have a strong foundational understanding or make a common word order mistake. The sentence is simple enough that about half would likely get it right, perhaps after a little bit of trial and error in their minds.

*   **competent:** **90% full marks**
    *   *Reasoning:* These students are generally able to read and understand simple English sentences. They would have a good understanding of SVO structure for basic tenses. 'He is reading a book' is a very common and straightforward sentence. The 10% who might miss it could be due to a momentary lapse, minor reading error, or misinterpreting the task, but most would get this correct easily.

*   **advanced:** **100% full marks**
    *   *Reasoning:* Students in this category would find this task very easy. They would immediately identify the correct word order and form the sentence without any difficulty. This requires recall of a fundamental grammatical rule and they would have mastered it.
