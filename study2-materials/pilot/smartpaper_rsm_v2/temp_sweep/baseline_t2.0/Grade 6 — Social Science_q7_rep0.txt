Okay, let's break down this question for my Class 6 students in a Rajasthan government school.

**Understanding the Question for my Students:**

First, I know many will struggle with the English itself. Keywords like "natural resources," "influences," and even "explain" can be tricky.

*   "Natural resources" (प्राकृतिक संसाधन - *prakritik sansadhan*): I'd have taught this multiple times in Hindi, using local examples.
*   "Rajasthan": They know where they live!
*   "Influences the lives of the people" (लोगों के जीवन को कैसे प्रभावित करता है - *logon ke jeevan ko kaise prabhavit karta hai*): This is the *reasoning* part, which is harder than recall.
*   "Explain" (बताओ/समझो - *batao/samjhao*): They might just list without elaboration.

The rubric asks for two natural resources (1 mark) and an explanation for one (another mark, making it a 2-mark question, though the prompt only mentions 1 mark for the whole thing - I'll assume the prompt implies 1 mark *for listing two correct resources*, and if an explanation was also required and graded, it would be a separate mark. I'll focus on just getting the *two correct resources* as per the prompt's explicit rubric).

**Natural Resources they might know for Rajasthan:**

*   **Water (पानी):** This is immediate for them. The scarcity is part of their daily life.
*   **Sand (रेत):** Obvious, as they live in the desert.
*   **Marble (संगमरमर):** Very famous from Makrana. Many would know this.
*   **Salt (नमक):** Sambhar Lake.
*   **Sunlight (सूरज की रौशनी):** For solar energy – something we talk about for electricity.
*   **Copper (ताँबा):** Khetri copper mines might be known.
*   **Zinc (जस्ता):** Zawar mines.
*   **Gypsum (जिप्सम):** If we've studied minerals specifically.
*   **Wind (हवा):** For wind energy, especially if we discuss renewable sources.

**Common Mistakes:**

*   **Language Barrier:** Not understanding "natural resources" fully.
*   **Simply Listing:** Even if they know natural resources, the "how it influences lives" part is harder. They might just write "Water is found." instead of "Water scarcity means people walk far."
*   **Irrelevant Answers:** Naming things that are not natural resources or not found in Rajasthan.
*   **One Resource Only:** Forgetting to mention the second.

Here's my assessment based on my experience:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   Even understanding the English words "natural resources" and "Rajasthan" together will be tough. They might identify *one* local thing, but linking it correctly to the term and providing *two* is challenging. If I've drilled it rigorously, maybe a few get lucky. They often get bogged down by the question itself.

**basic:** 30% full marks
*   They understand "natural resources" better (perhaps recalling Hindi equivalent *prakritik sansadhan*). They will likely list "पानी" (water) and "रेत" (sand). They might manage to get *two correct resources* with some effort, possibly with errors in spelling if they try to write in English. The second resource might be slightly generic or require deeper recall (like Marble or Salt).

**competent:** 75% full marks
*   These students grasp the concept and know the context of Rajasthan. They'll comfortably list two correct natural resources like "water," "sand," "marble," "sunlight," or "salt." Their main hurdle would be accuracy in English spelling if they don't commonly use the terms in writing.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   They will understand the question immediately. They can easily recall and articulate two natural resources. They would likely pick "Water," "Marble," "Sunlight," or "Salt." They might even attempt to explain the influence, even if not explicitly asked in the given rubric for *full marks*.
