Okay, thinking about my Class 8 students, especially given their backgrounds and language challenges, here's my breakdown for the Harappan urban planning question:

First, the good news: "Harappan Civilization" and "urban planning" (or even "cities/shahron ki banawat") are topics we definitely cover. We'd use visuals – diagrams, pictures of excavations – and simple language, translating difficult terms into Hindi. We'd emphasize the baked bricks, the grid, and the drains because those are visually striking and easy to grasp as "unique" or "special."

However, the question is in English. While I'd write it on the board and perhaps translate keywords like "key feature" (khaas baat, mukhya visheshta), many students would still struggle to fully understand the question or frame their answer in English. "Describe" can be tricky.

**Common Mistakes & Challenges:**

*   **Language:** Many would understand the concept in Hindi but falter in recalling or expressing it in English. They might know "pakki eent" (baked brick) but not "baked bricks" in writing.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall. If they haven't revised the specific points well, or if they struggle to retain details, they'll guess or leave it blank.
*   **Specificity:** "Advanced drainage system" is quite specific. "Good planning" isn't specific enough for full marks, though it might show partial understanding. "Grid layout" is also specific.
*   **Misremembering details:** Some might mix it up with other ancient civilizations, or recall a feature but not the most prominent or "key" ones we emphasized.
*   **Only remembering *one* detail:** This question only asks for *one*, which is good. If it asked for multiple, the percentages would drop significantly.

Here's my estimation:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   They would struggle immensely with reading and comprehending the question itself in English. Even with a translation, forming a coherent answer, let alone a specific one like "advanced drainage system," would be beyond their current capabilities. They might write "harappa good," but not meet the specificity requirement.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   Some from this group might catch on to the question's core. They might recall "pakki eentein" (baked bricks) or "naliyan" (drains) and try to write it. The 10% assumes they manage to write "baked bricks" or "good drainage system" with some degree of correctness, perhaps from rote learning or clear visuals in class. Many would understand it in Hindi but fail to express it correctly in English. They might just write one word like "drains."

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   These students generally pay attention, participate, and attempt to grasp the material. They are more likely to have understood the "key features" during teaching and may have better retention. They can usually read simple English questions with some effort. Half of them would be able to recall and accurately phrase at least one key feature like "advanced drainage system" or "grid layout of streets" or "use of baked bricks" in understandable English. The other half might stumble on the English phrasing or remember a less specific point.

**advanced: 80% full marks**
*   These students are bright, generally attentive, and often have a better grasp of English compared to their peers. They are more likely to fully understand the question, recall the specific features, and articulate them clearly in English. They would likely offer options like "well-planned grid layout" or "elaborate drainage system" or "citadel and lower town division." The 20% who miss it might make a small factual error, be slightly less specific, or perhaps struggle with articulating it perfectly even within their higher skill level.
