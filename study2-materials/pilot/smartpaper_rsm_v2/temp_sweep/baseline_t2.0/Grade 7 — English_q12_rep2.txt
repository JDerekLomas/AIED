Okay, this is a very common transformation question we encounter in Class 7, and I have a clear picture of how my students would perform.

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language Barriers:** They wouldn't even understand the question "Change...Active Voice to Passive Voice." Many would struggle to read "blew" correctly, let alone understand its past tense context. They often confuse tenses and verb forms.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires recalling the passive voice structure *and* the past participle of 'blow'. For struggling students, both are major hurdles.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   They might just write "The wind was blown the leaves away."
    *   They might completely rephrase the sentence incorrectly, not grasping the voice concept.
    *   They wouldn't know "blown."
    *   They wouldn't be able to identify the subject and object correctly.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   **Language Barriers:** They *might* be able to read the question and the original sentence, but the *concept* of active/passive voice is often a superficial understanding, not a deep one. They rely heavily on rote-learned structures.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall the general "subject + helping verb + V3 + by + object" structure but struggle with applying it correctly to different tenses and irregular verbs. The irregular verb 'blow'/'blew'/'blown' would be a common trap.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   "The leaves was blew away by the wind." (Verb agreement error, wrong V3)
    *   "The leaves are blown away by the wind." (Tense error)
    *   "The leaves were blew away by the wind." (Wrong V3)
    *   They might forget "by the wind" sometimes.
    *   They often use 'was' incorrectly for plural subjects.

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   **Language Barriers:** They would read and understand the question and sentence without much difficulty.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would generally recall the passive voice structure for past simple tense. The main challenge here would be remembering the past participle "blown" accurately, as irregular verbs are still a tricky spot even for competent students who are not daily practitioners of English. Some might remember "blew" but not "blown."
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   "The leaves were blew away by the wind." (Incorrect past participle 'blew' instead of 'blown') This would be the most common error.
    *   A smaller percentage might still make a 'was/were' mistake if they are not paying close attention to the plural 'leaves'.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Language Barriers:** No issue. They read and comprehend everything easily.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would almost certainly recall both the passive voice structure for past simple and the correct past participle "blown." They've practiced these kinds of transformations more consistently.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Even here, a tiny percentage might have a momentary mental block on the irregular verb form or a rare grammatical slip-up due to pressure or distraction. It's unlikely, but not impossible to get it wrong in some trivial way. They would likely get the core transformation correct but might make a minor error like omitting 'by the wind' (though less common in this structure).
