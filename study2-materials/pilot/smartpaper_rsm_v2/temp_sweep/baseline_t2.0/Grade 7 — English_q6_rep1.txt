This is a good question that highlights the challenges of teaching English in a multi-level classroom with language barriers. Let's break down how my students would likely perform.

First, the phrasing "describes the poet's writing style" itself can be a barrier. For many students, "describes" and "writing style" might not be immediately understood, even if they have some basic vocabulary. They might focus on "poet" and think of something about the poet's life or what the poet is writing *about*, rather than *how* it's written.

Let's assume the question is tied to a specific poem that has just been taught and discussed in class. If it's a general question without context, the performance would be much lower. I will assume we've recently covered a poem and perhaps even explicitly discussed its style (e.g., "Children, did you notice how the poet uses very easy words?" or "The poet paints a picture with words, doesn't she?").

Here's my estimation, keeping in mind the typical challenges:

**Struggling:** 5% full marks
* **Language barrier is huge here.** Many won't understand "describes" or "writing style" fully.
* Even if they grasp a bit, thinking of a single, appropriate word like "simple" or "descriptive" will be very difficult. They might write a whole sentence summarizing the poem or say "good style."
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires reasoning/application, even if "style" was discussed. They need to distill observations into a single adjective, which is a higher-order skill for this group.
* **Common mistakes:** Off-topic answers, single words like "beautiful" (describing the poem's effect, not style), or "story."

**Basic:** 15% full marks
* They might understand "writing style" with some prompting or if we discussed it clearly in class.
* They might be able to identify one aspect if it's very prominent and we've focused on it. For example, if the poem uses very common words, they might connect that to "simple."
* **Still challenging:** Generating that single adjective requires them to abstract from their reading and connect it to a concept of "style." They might write a short phrase rather than a single word, losing the "full marks" because of precision.
* **Common mistakes:** Providing a phrase ("uses easy words") instead of an adjective, or a slightly less precise adjective.

**Competent:** 50% full marks
* This group generally understands "writing style" and has a better grasp of English vocabulary.
* They are more likely to have paid attention during discussions about the poet's approach.
* **Key Factor:** Whether a *suitable and relevant word* like "simple," "descriptive," or "direct" was explicitly discussed or implied during the teaching of the poem. If the teacher modeled these kinds of descriptors, their chances increase significantly.
* **Common mistakes:** May choose a generic word like "nice" or "good," or describe the *poem's content* rather than its *style*, although less frequently than the basic group.

**Advanced:** 85% full marks
* This group understands the question and the concept of "writing style."
* They have a broader vocabulary to choose from and can articulate their understanding.
* They can independently infer a suitable adjective from the poem even if it wasn't explicitly stated.
* They are less likely to make the mistakes of the other groups.
* **Remaining 15%:** Could still be caught out if the "style" is subtle and we haven't given *any* guidance. They might overthink it, or choose a more complex word that's less "simple" than what the rubric expects (e.g., "colloquial" for an informal poem, which might be too advanced for a 7th-grade rubric looking for "informal"). Or simply a careless error.

Overall, the single biggest factor here is whether the poem's style was explicitly discussed in class, and if specific examples of suitable descriptive words were used by the teacher or generated with student input. If it's purely a "figure it out yourself" question without groundwork, all percentages would drop.
