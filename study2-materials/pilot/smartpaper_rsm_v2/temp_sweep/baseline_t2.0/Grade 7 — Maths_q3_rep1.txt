This is a classic "plug and play" formula question. The main hurdles will be language and recall.

*   **Language barriers:** The words "area," "base," and "height" might be understood, but "whose" and the full sentence structure could be tricky for the struggling group.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is purely recall of a formula. If they know it, they're likely to get it right, assuming they can perform the multiplication. If they don't, reasoning alone won't help much here.
*   **Specificity of answer:** Very specific – it requires using the formula directly. No room for approximation.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Forgetting the "1/2" in the formula.
    *   Mixing up area formulas (e.g., using rectangle area, or `base × height` directly).
    *   Multiplication errors.
    *   Units missing or incorrect (though the rubric only asks for using the formula correctly).

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
Even if they vaguely remember "area" and "triangle," the full formula `1/2 * b * h` will be difficult to recall. The language barrier for understanding the question clearly will be significant. Many might attempt `8 * 6` without the `1/2`. A very small number might have just reviewed it and be able to recall, but it's unlikely to be solid.

**basic: 40% full marks**
This group might recall *some* formula related to area, and might even associate `base * height` with it. The `1/2` is the critical piece they might miss. They will struggle with recalling it consistently, but many would have seen it. Those who practice simple direct formula applications would get this. Some might just do `8*6 = 48` or `48/2 = 24`. As the rubric *only* requires stating or using the correct formula, the latter would still qualify.

**competent: 90% full marks**
This group would have a solid understanding and recall of basic geometric formulas. They would likely know `1/2 * base * height`. The primary risk would be a silly arithmetic error or momentarily confusing it with a parallelogram formula.

**advanced: 100% full marks**
This is a straightforward application for them. They would recall the formula instantly and apply it correctly without issues.
