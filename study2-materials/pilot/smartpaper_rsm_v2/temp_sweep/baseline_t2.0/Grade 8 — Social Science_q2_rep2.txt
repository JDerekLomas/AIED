Here's my assessment based on my experience teaching Class 8 Social Science in an Indian government school:

*   **struggling:** **0% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** Even if they remember 'Harappan Civilization', the term "urban planning" itself is abstract and challenging for them in English. They might recall *something* about cities, but connecting it to a *key feature* of its *planning* and expressing it clearly in English is almost impossible for this group. They often struggle with recalling specific details even in their mother tongue, let alone translating complex concepts into English.
*   **basic:** **10% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** Some students in this group might remember a basic fact like "well-planned cities" or "drains." However, many would struggle with articulating it precisely enough to score full marks. They might say "cities were good" or "they had pipes for water" but miss the nuance of "advanced drainage system" or "grid layout." The language barrier would still be a significant hurdle in expressing the detail clearly. They rely heavily on rote memorization of specific phrases, and if they haven't specifically memorized a "key feature of urban planning," they'll falter.
*   **competent:** **60% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** This group generally has a better grasp of the concepts and vocabulary. They are more likely to recall a specific feature like the grid pattern, baked bricks, or the drainage system. While they might still face some challenges with precise English phrasing, they'd usually manage to convey the essence of one key feature clearly enough to score. They can usually link keywords (Harappa, cities, plan) to the details they've learned.
*   **advanced:** **90% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** These students would very likely recall and articulate one key feature correctly. They often have a strong foundation in English and a good understanding of the subject matter. They'd be able to choose a specific feature like the "grid-patterned streets" or the "advanced covered drainage system" and describe it accurately. The language or specificity of the answer would not be an issue for them. They tend to be able to retrieve information efficiently and phrase it correctly.
