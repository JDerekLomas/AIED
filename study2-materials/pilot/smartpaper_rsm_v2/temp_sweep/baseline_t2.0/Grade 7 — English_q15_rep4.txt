This is a common question, and one I often prepare students for in various contexts, including exams and 'About Me' activities.

Here's my estimation for full marks:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 10% full marks
competent: 50% full marks
advanced: 90% full marks

**Explanation for the percentages:**

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** These students will find it very difficult to string together 4-5 coherent sentences in English.
    *   **Language barriers:** Many might understand the words 'favourite' and 'hobby' if pre-taught, but formulating grammatically correct sentences, linking them logically, and covering all three criteria (what, when, why) will be almost impossible for them.
    *   **Recall vs. reasoning:** It primarily requires recall of vocabulary and basic sentence structures, but even that is a challenge. The 'why I enjoy it' part demands a slight reasoning element.
    *   **Specifics:** The requirement of 4-5 sentences and hitting all three points is quite specific for their level.
    *   **Common mistakes:** Short, fragmented sentences, incorrect verb tenses (especially 'do' vs 'does' or past tense if they recount an past event), wrong prepositions, very limited vocabulary, and often omitting one or two of the required points. They might write 2-3 very simple, disjointed sentences. "My hobby drawing. I draw in evening. I like it." This would not score full marks for completeness.

*   **Basic (35% of class):** A small fraction might manage, often with significant grammatical errors, but still meeting the word count and covering the points.
    *   **Language barriers:** They can read the prompt and understand it. They know common vocabulary for hobbies (playing, reading, drawing).
    *   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They can recall basic sentence structures (e.g., "My hobby is...", "I do it in...", "I like it because..."). The 'why' might be very simple ("it is fun," "I feel happy").
    *   **Specifics:** Meeting 4-5 sentences with all three points is achievable but with a struggle. They might produce 3-4 simple sentences with some grammatical issues. "My favourite hobby is playing cricket. I play cricket with my friends after school. I play every day. I like cricket because it is very fun. I am happy." This might just scrape a full mark if the errors aren't too severe and the meaning is clear.
    *   **Common mistakes:** Tense inconsistencies, subject-verb agreement issues, run-on sentences or overly simplistic sentences. They often struggle with expanding on the 'why' beyond a basic "it's fun" or "I like it."

*   **Competent (20% of class):** About half of these students would likely hit all the marks, potentially with minor errors that don't detract from clarity.
    *   **Language barriers:** They understand the prompt well and have a functional vocabulary.
    *   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They can recall appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures, and articulate a clearer "why" with some simple supporting details.
    *   **Specifics:** Meeting the length and content requirements is manageable for them.
    *   **Common mistakes:** Minor punctuation errors, occasional awkward phrasing, or slightly repetitive vocabulary. They can generally craft a paragraph that covers all points reasonably well.

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** Most of these students would score full marks, potentially writing paragraphs that are a bit more sophisticated in vocabulary and sentence structure.
    *   **Language barriers:** No issues with understanding the prompt or expressing themselves.
    *   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They can easily formulate and elaborate on the 'why', using more descriptive language.
    *   **Specifics:** They would meet or exceed the requirements with ease and accuracy.
    *   **Common mistakes:** Very few, perhaps a single spelling error or a comma splice, but nothing that would lose a point for clarity or completeness.
