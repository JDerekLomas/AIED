Here's my estimation for full marks based on the student demographics and the prompt:

struggling: 0-2% full marks
basic: 5-10% full marks
competent: 50-60% full marks
advanced: 80-90% full marks

**Explanation for the estimations:**

**Struggling (35%):**
*   **Language Barrier:** Many in this group struggle significantly with reading and understanding even simple English sentences. "Write a short paragraph" itself might be confusing. "Complete paragraph" and "clearly mentions" are too complex for them. They'd likely write one or two broken sentences, if anything, without the required elements.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This task requires both recall (what is their hobby) and some basic reasoning (why they enjoy it). However, articulating it in coherent English is the primary barrier.
*   **Specificity:** The required elements (hobby, when, why) are too specific for them to cover adequately in English.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Single words, incomplete sentences, writing in Hindi, completely off-topic responses, or simply leaving it blank. They would struggle even to identify *their* favourite hobby in English vocabulary, let alone elaborate.

**Basic (35%):**
*   **Language Barrier:** This group can understand simple instructions with some effort, but constructing sentences independently is a challenge. They might pick up key words like "hobby," "when," "why."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can usually identify their hobby and a basic reason. The "when" might be an extra hurdle.
*   **Specificity:** They might hit 1-2 out of 3 required points, but putting them into 4-5 connected sentences would be very difficult. They might write isolated sentences: "My hobby is cricket. I play in evening. I like to play cricket." This wouldn't quite be a "complete paragraph" or flow well.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Run-on sentences, grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, not using correct tenses, fragmented sentences, difficulty connecting ideas into a paragraph. Some might get a partial sentence for "when" and "why."

**Competent (20%):**
*   **Language Barrier:** They can understand the prompt clearly and usually have enough vocabulary to express common hobbies and simple reasons. They understand the concept of a "paragraph."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This task is well within their cognitive ability.
*   **Specificity:** They should be able to cover all three points (hobby, when, why) in complete sentences. The challenge will be ensuring it's a coherent "paragraph" of 4-5 sentences and maintaining good grammar. Some might miss the sentence count, writing 2-3 strong sentences instead of the full 4-5. Others might have minor grammatical slips.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Occasional grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, articles, prepositions), awkward phrasing, sometimes struggling to elaborate enough to reach 4-5 sentences while keeping it relevant.

**Advanced (10%):**
*   **Language Barrier:** This group has a solid grasp of basic English grammar and vocabulary. They understand nuances like "complete paragraph" and sentence flow.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This task is straightforward for them.
*   **Specificity:** They should comfortably provide all the requested information in a well-structured paragraph, with good sentence variation and appropriate vocabulary.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very few, if any. Perhaps a minor spelling error or a slightly repetitive sentence, but overall, they would meet the criteria for full marks with ease.
