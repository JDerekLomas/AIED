Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 6 students from similar backgrounds. This question is about factual recall, which can be tricky for all levels given the various factors.

**struggling: 0-5% full marks**
For this group, the primary hurdle is language. Many wouldn't even comprehend "major mountain ranges" or "located in India" accurately without significant teacher scaffolding. Even if they've heard the names, spelling or correctly associating them with "mountain ranges" in an English question is very difficult. They might write 'Gangaa' if they've heard it a lot in Geography. Their focus might be on key terms they pick up rather than the full meaning. Maybe one or two might accidentally get 'Himalayas' if it's very fresh in their memory and they copy it correctly from somewhere.

**basic: 20-30% full marks**
This group would likely understand the question's gist, even if they struggle with some individual words. They recall 'Himalayas' readily as it's often the first and most emphasized mountain range taught. They might also remember 'Aravalli' or 'Vindhya' from classroom discussions, especially if a map activity was done recently. The challenge here is usually recalling *two* correct names and spelling them accurately enough for identification. They might get one correct but struggle with the second, or misspell badly.

**competent: 60-70% full marks**
These students typically have a better grasp of English vocabulary related to Social Science and can recall key facts. They'd almost certainly get 'Himalayas' and have a good chance of naming another like 'Aravalli' or 'Western Ghats'. Their main challenge might be accurate spelling, but they'd be able to identify at least two correct ranges. They likely pay more attention to the map work and memorizing these specific terms.

**advanced: 90-100% full marks**
For these students, the question is straightforward recall. They would understand the language perfectly and almost always be able to list two, three, or even more mountain ranges accurately. Spelling might not be 100% perfect, but it would be recognizable. They have a stronger memory for facts and the ability to link the English term with the geographical feature.
