This is a classic question for Class 8 and crucial for understanding British rule. Here's my assessment based on my students:

*   **Language barriers:** This is a big one. Even if they know the facts, expressing it precisely in English can be tough for the struggling and basic groups. Many will struggle to understand "contribute to the expansion" itself and how to link the cause and effect clearly in English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** It primarily requires recall of a specific consequence of Plassey. While understanding "expansion of power" involves some reasoning, the core of the answer is a memorized fact.
*   **Specificity:** The required answer is quite specific: *political dominance/control over Bengal, placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab*. Simply saying "British got more powerful" might not get full marks.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Many will know "Plassey, 1757, Clive won, Siraj-ud-daulah lost" but struggle to articulate *how* that led to expansion of power.
    *   Confusion with other battles or general statements about British gaining control over trade.
    *   Difficulty expressing "puppet ruler" or "political control" in their own words in English.
    *   Leaving out "Bengal" as the specific region.

Given these factors, especially the language barrier and the need for a precise answer, I expect the following:

struggling: 0-5% full marks (Maybe 1 or 2 students who happen to have a good day or excellent rote memory and can pick out key phrases.)
basic: 15-20% full marks (They might mention British control or Mir Jafar but struggle to combine it clearly with "political dominance over Bengal" in fluent English. Many will get partial marks for saying British became powerful.)
competent: 50-60% full marks (They generally understand the political consequence and can frame it in decent English, even if not perfectly articulated.)
advanced: 85-95% full marks (These students usually grasp the nuanced impact, understand terms like 'political dominance' and 'puppet ruler,' and can express it clearly in English.)
