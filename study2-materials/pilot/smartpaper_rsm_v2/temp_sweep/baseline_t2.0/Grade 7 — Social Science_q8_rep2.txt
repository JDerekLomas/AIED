This is a very insightful question that really makes me put myself back in the classroom. Given the demographics and learning profiles you've described, my estimation would be:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
**basic: 20% full marks**
**competent: 70% full marks**
**advanced: 90% full marks**

Here's my thinking process for each group:

*   **Language Barriers (Many can't read English well):** This is the single biggest hurdle. The question is in English. While I would have covered this topic extensively in Hindi, the expectation to read, comprehend, and recall/write *in English* for "full marks" immediately filters out a large chunk, especially the struggling and basic learners. Even if they know the answer in their minds in Hindi, translating it and writing it correctly in English ("Agriculture", "Animal Husbandry") is a high bar.

*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question primarily requires recall. Rajasthan is a specific region, and while *some* reasoning about natural resources (e.g., desert -> less agriculture, more animal husbandry) could lead to an answer, for Class 7, it's generally taught as a factual recall item after lessons on different regions. The "describe any one in brief" also requires factual recall and a basic understanding of the chosen occupation.

*   **How specific the required answer is:** "Names at least two main occupations correctly" and the examples provided (Agriculture/farming, Animal Husbandry/pastoralism, handicrafts) are specific enough. My students often know 'kheti' and 'pashupalan' in Hindi. The challenge is the English equivalents. Handicrafts might be a bit harder for them to recall spontaneously as a 'main' occupation unless specifically highlighted as such during lessons about Rajasthan.

*   **Common mistakes my students make:**
    *   **Direct Translation errors:** Writing "farming work" instead of "agriculture" or "farmer" instead of "farming." These might be marked down for not using the precise English term.
    *   **Spelling mistakes:** Even if they try "agriculture" or "animal husbandry," significant spelling errors might cause them to lose a mark.
    *   **Providing only one occupation:** Many might just recall "agriculture" and struggle to think of a second distinct main occupation quickly, or fail to frame "describe any one" properly.
    *   **Focusing on tourist-related activities:** Some might mention 'tourism' or 'folk dances/music' thinking of Rajasthan's culture, but these aren't considered primary "occupations" for a majority of the rural population.
    *   **Not attempting the English:** For many struggling learners, simply looking at the English question is enough to make them not write anything if they are unsure how to frame it in English.

**Detailed breakdown for each group:**

*   **Struggling (35% of students): 5% full marks**
    *   **Language barrier:** A massive hurdle. Many won't understand the question well enough to even attempt it correctly.
    *   **Recall:** They might dimly recall "kheti" (farming) if pushed, but linking it to "agriculture" and then a second one like "animal husbandry" in English, plus a description, is beyond most of them.
    *   **Common mistake:** Blank answer, completely wrong answer (e.g., city occupations), or attempting only one word with severe spelling errors. The 5% would be the very few who might manage to get 'farming' and 'animal husbandry' somewhat correctly spelled, perhaps with *some* scaffolding or prior rote memorization.

*   **Basic (35% of students): 20% full marks**
    *   **Language barrier:** They might read the question and grasp the gist, but precise English expression is a problem.
    *   **Recall:** Many will know 'kheti' and 'pashupalan'. Some might recall 'hastkala' (handicrafts). The challenge is accurate English words and spelling.
    *   **Common mistakes:** Giving one correct occupation but failing to give a second or describing it briefly, significant spelling mistakes, using informal English like "farming work" or "animal keeping." They often hit one key point but miss the secondary requirements for full marks. The 20% would be those who can mostly get two terms right (maybe one with a minor spelling error) and provide a very simple description in basic English.

*   **Competent (20% of students): 70% full marks**
    *   **Language barrier:** They can generally read and understand the question. While their English might not be perfect, it's usually comprehensible enough for an answer.
    *   **Recall:** They will almost certainly recall Agriculture
