This is a great question that probes not just recall, but also how effective our teaching methods have been in bridging language and background gaps. Given the student profile, I'd anticipate the following scores:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 10% full marks
competent: 50% full marks
advanced: 90% full marks

Here's my thinking behind these percentages:

**Overall Challenges:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The biggest hurdle is "Describe one key feature...". Many struggling and even basic students would have difficulty even understanding the question in English. They might know "Harappan," "shaher," "naali" (drainage), but putting it together in a coherent English sentence is a big ask. My teaching would definitely involve bilingual explanation, but the assessment is in English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question primarily requires recall. Urban planning, while a fascinating concept, is not something most students from economically weaker sections naturally relate to in their daily lives, making abstract recall harder without very strong reinforcement.
*   **Specificity:** The question requires "one *key* feature" and then specifically asks for "urban planning." While "use of baked bricks" is a feature, its "key-ness" within urban planning specifically might be a little less obvious to students compared to, say, the drainage system or the grid layout.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Vocabulary issues:** Not knowing "urban planning," "citadel," "drainage system," "grid layout."
    *   **Providing general facts:** "They used baked bricks" might be offered, but without linking it to the *planning* aspect.
    *   **Incomplete answers:** Just mentioning "good roads" instead of "well-planned grid layout of roads."
    *   **Translation errors:** Attempting to translate a Hindi thought into incorrect English.
    *   **Forgetting specific details:** Remembering they had *some* plan, but not the specific examples taught.

**Category-wise Breakdown:**

*   **Struggling (35% of students): 0% full marks**
    *   **Why:** Even with the best teaching, these students are fighting significant uphill battles with foundational literacy and language comprehension in English. They might remember "Indus Valley Civilization" or "Harappan," and possibly some Hindi words like "naali," but expressing "The city had an excellent drainage system" or "The streets were in a grid pattern" in English is highly unlikely for *any* of them without specific promptings. Their focus is often on individual words rather than sentence structure or conceptual understanding in English. They would likely either leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant or uninterpretable.

*   **Basic (35% of students): 10% full marks**
    *   **Why:** Some of these students might have grasped one or two specific features with consistent drilling and visual aids during lessons (pictures, diagrams). They might remember "drainage system" or "grid streets." The 10% success rate accounts for those few who, despite language difficulties, managed to internalize *one* core phrase from the lesson material, possibly by rote, and can reproduce it here. For instance, they might be able to write "Good drainage system" (which would score) or "Streets were straight." Many others would struggle with vocabulary, incomplete thoughts, or simply not recall the precise feature in English. They'd often get confused with other aspects of the civilization.

*   **Competent (20% of students): 50% full marks**
    *   **Why:** These students have a decent understanding and usually manage basic comprehension of English questions. They would recall the major features of urban planning. However, language can still trip them up, leading to incomplete or slightly less precise answers. They might write "Cities had a good water system" instead of "advanced drainage system," or "Roads were straight" instead of "grid layout." Some might give two features when asked for one, and while good, the rubric is specific. They also might get stuck trying to remember the specific English terminology (e.g., "citadel"). Half of them should be able to articulate one clear, correct feature like "The city was divided into two parts, a citadel and a lower town," or "They had a well-planned drainage system."

*   **Advanced (10% of students): 90% full marks**
    *   **Why:** These students are usually confident with English comprehension and have a stronger grasp of the concepts. They likely understand the term "urban planning" and can readily recall and articulate a key feature with appropriate vocabulary. They've likely studied the diagrams and maps more closely. They might provide answers like, "The cities were planned in a grid layout with straight streets cutting each other at right angles,"
