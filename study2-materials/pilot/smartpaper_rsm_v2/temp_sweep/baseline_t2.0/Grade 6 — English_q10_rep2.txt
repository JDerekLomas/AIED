This is a classic 'some/any' question that comes up frequently. Given the demographics and typical learning patterns in my Class 6 English, here's how I'd estimate the full marks for each group:

*   **Struggling (35%):** For these students, the primary hurdles are reading comprehension and vocabulary. Many might not even recognize "some" and "any" as distinct words with different uses. They rely heavily on rote learning if they've encountered this rule before, but the application is tough. Even if I've taught it, their retention of grammar rules can be very low, especially with limited practice and contextual understanding. They might just pick one randomly or default to a word they recognize more often.
    **struggling: 5% full marks**

*   **Basic (35%):** These students can generally read the sentence, but understanding the nuances of 'some' vs. 'any' might be challenging. They might recall a simple rule (like 'some' for positive, 'any' for negative/questions) if it was recently taught, but applying it accurately can be hit or miss. Without robust understanding or significant practice, they're prone to guessing or applying an incomplete rule. The "There are..." structure might prompt them to think of a positive statement.
    **basic: 30% full marks**

*   **Competent (20%):** These students generally grasp basic grammar rules. They've likely been exposed to 'some' and 'any' differences and have a foundational understanding. With a positive affirmative sentence like this, most would correctly identify 'some'. They might recall the rule consciously or implicitly "feel" it's the correct word.
    **competent: 80% full marks**

*   **Advanced (10%):** These students typically have a good grasp of basic English grammar and vocabulary. They would immediately recognize that 'some' is used for indefinite quantities in affirmative sentences, while 'any' is generally for negative or interrogative sentences. This rule is straightforward for them.
    **advanced: 100% full marks**
