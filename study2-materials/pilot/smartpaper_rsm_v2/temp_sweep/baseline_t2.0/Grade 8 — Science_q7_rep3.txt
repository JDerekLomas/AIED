Let's break this down from my perspective as an 8th-grade Science teacher in a government school.

**Understanding the Question and Scoring:**

*   **Question:** A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit. Does gardener notice any change after some days? Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health
*   **Scoring (Max 0.5):** User suggests significant changes. This implies noticing decomposition, reduction in volume, possibly a change in color/smell. A simple "yes" won't suffice for *significant changes*. The "give reasons" and "evaluate if beneficial for soil health" parts are also crucial for full marks, though the rubric only explicitly mentions the first part for the 0.5 score. Let's assume for *full marks (0.5)* they need to say "yes, significant changes" and ideally give a simple reason (like 'it rots' or 'turns into manure'). If it were a 2-mark question, the full breakdown (reasons, benefit) would be required. Since it's 0.5, "Yes, it changes/rots" should likely be enough if they identify *some* change.
*   **Key concepts:** Decomposition, composting, organic matter, soil health.

**Analysis by Student Group:**

1.  **Language Barriers:** "Waste," "pit," "beneficial for soil health" are all somewhat common terms, but "evaluate" might be tricky. The core idea of "rotting" or "turning into खाद (khaad - manure)" is widely understood. Many students might struggle to frame a complete sentence in English, even if they grasp the concept.
2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:**
    *   **Recall:** Students might recall seeing compost pits or discussing decomposition. This is a common science topic in 8th grade.
    *   **Reasoning:** Linking the rotting material to *soil health* requires a bit of reasoning (understanding that decomposed material enriches the soil).
3.  **Specificity:** The prompt for 0.5 score is "suggests significant changes." This means a simple "Yes" is insufficient. "Yes, they will decompose/rot" or "Yes, it turns into compost/manure" would likely qualify.
4.  **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Simple "Yes" without elaborating on *what* changes.
    *   Lack of English vocabulary to describe the changes accurately (e.g., just "it will become different").
    *   Focusing only on the change and forgetting the "beneficial for soil health" part, or vice-versa (though the 0.5 mark is only on changes).

**Percentage of Students Scoring Full Marks (0.5 on the *change* aspect only):**

Given the language and focus on the initial part of the question for the 0.5 score:

*   **Struggling (35%):** These students often get stuck on the English phrasing. They might understand *conceptually* that things rot, but struggle to articulate it in English. Many might write "Yes," but not enough to suggest "significant changes." Some might remember the term "khaad" (manure) but not be able to write it in English correctly, or frame the full thought.
    *   **Estimate: 5% full marks.** (Those few who happen to have enough English words like "rot" or "decompose" or recall a specific term taught, coupled with recognizing it's not just "yes.")

*   **Basic (35%):** These students will likely understand the core concept of decomposition. They might write "Yes, it will rot" or "Yes, it will change into khaad/manure." They may not use very sophisticated vocabulary but will convey the idea of significant change. Their struggle will be more with forming a grammatically correct, complete English sentence, but they should capture the essence.
    *   **Estimate: 40% full marks.** (Many will give an adequate description of change, even if simple. The jump from "Yes" to "Yes, it will rot/decompose" is key here.)

*   **Competent (20%):** These students will almost certainly identify the change clearly, likely using terms like "decompose," "turns into manure/compost," and might even start to think about the "why" (microorganisms). Their English will be sufficient to describe the significant change.
    *   **Estimate: 90% full marks.** (They will comfortably answer this first part well.)

*   **Advanced (10%):** These students will nail the description of significant change, likely using precise scientific vocabulary where applicable ("decomposition by microorganisms," "forms humus/compost"). They will also immediately grasp the beneficial aspect for the soil.
