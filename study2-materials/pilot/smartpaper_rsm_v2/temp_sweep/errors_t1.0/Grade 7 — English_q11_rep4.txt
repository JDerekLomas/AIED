REASONING: Given the extremely low pass rates on other questions, particularly those requiring basic sentence construction or understanding of literary terms, and the prevalence of empty responses or completely irrelevant answers, a significant portion of students will likely struggle to identify a single word as an adjective, let alone an adjective phrase. Many might attempt to identify the verb or a noun, or simply leave it blank. Even those who recognize "tiny" as describing the bird might not label it as an "adjective."
