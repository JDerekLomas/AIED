REASONING: Given the extremely low pass rates on other questions, and the common issue of empty responses or completely unrelated answers, very few students will be able to correctly identify an adjective, let alone understand the term "adjective phrase" or apply it. They might pick "bird" or "nest" if they guess a noun.
