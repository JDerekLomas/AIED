REASONING: Many students struggle with understanding specific details from a text, often providing generic or unrelated answers. Even though the question is direct, "who lived inside the book" requires recall of a specific detail. With a direct question and a simple expected answer, some students might guess correctly or recall it if it was clearly emphasized. However, given the general low comprehension, many might give "empty responses" or incorrect guesses.
