REASONING: Students are likely to make errors with negative numbers, either by incorrectly subtracting (e.g., 9 - 4 = 5) and presenting it as positive 5, or by struggling with transposing the number across the equality sign. The concept of negative numbers and basic integer operations is often a weak point.
