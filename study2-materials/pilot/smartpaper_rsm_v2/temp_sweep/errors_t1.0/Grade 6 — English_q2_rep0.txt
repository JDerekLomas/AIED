REASONING: Many students struggle with understanding specific details from text and forming complete sentences. While "fairy" is a single word, the abstract nature of a "magical fairy" living *inside* a book might be confusing for some. Many might give one-word answers, or struggle to recall the exact detail, potentially mixing it up with other story elements or providing generic answers like "a person" or "someone."
