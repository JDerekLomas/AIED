REASONING: Given the extremely low pass rates on other questions and the prevalence of empty responses or completely off-topic answers, students are unlikely to understand grammatical terms like "adjective phrase," even if they know what an adjective is. They might pick "tiny bird" or "in our balcony" as a phrase, or just write "tiny," but connecting it to "adjective phrase" will be a major challenge.
