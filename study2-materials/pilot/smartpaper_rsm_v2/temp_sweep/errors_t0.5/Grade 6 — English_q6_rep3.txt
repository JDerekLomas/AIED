REASONING: Students struggle with abstract concepts like "writing style" and "theme," often providing irrelevant answers or leaving responses blank. Even when asked for personal opinions (like "favourite hobby"), they tend to list items rather than elaborate. For this question, while identifying a line might be easier, explaining "why" will be a significant challenge, leading to many incomplete or irrelevant answers.
