REASONING: Students struggle with abstract concepts like "writing style" and "theme," often providing irrelevant answers or leaving responses blank. Even when asked for personal preferences like "favourite hobby," they give fragmented lists rather than coherent sentences. Therefore, asking them to identify a line and explain *why* they like it will be very challenging, as it requires both comprehension and expression of personal reasoning. Many will likely just quote a line without explanation, or give a very basic, undeveloped reason.
