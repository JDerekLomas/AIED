REASONING: Students struggle with basic sentence construction and understanding core concepts like "style" or "theme." Active/passive voice transformation involves identifying subject, verb, and object, changing the verb form, and often reordering the sentence, which is a complex task for students at this level. Many will likely struggle with the past participle "blown" and the correct auxiliary verb "were."
