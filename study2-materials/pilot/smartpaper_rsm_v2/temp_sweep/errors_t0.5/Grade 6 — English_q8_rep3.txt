REASONING: Given the prevalence of "Empty Response" and very basic, often unrelated answers in other sections, many students will likely struggle with sentence structure. However, this question has all the necessary words, which is a significant advantage over questions requiring original thought or vocabulary. The words are also common and simple. Students might make errors in word order (e.g., "A book he is reading") but are less likely to leave it blank or give a completely irrelevant answer compared to the other question types.
