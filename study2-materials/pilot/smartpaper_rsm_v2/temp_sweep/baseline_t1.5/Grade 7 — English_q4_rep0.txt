Okay, let's break this down from the perspective of teaching Class 7 English in an Indian government school, considering all the nuances.

First, let's look at the question itself: **"Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."**

The scoring rubric: "The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason. Max score: 1"

**Analysis of the Question for My Students:**

1.  **Language Barriers:**
    *   "Do you think..." - This is accessible.
    *   "...the king's questions..." - This requires recall of the *content* of the questions, not just that "the king asked questions." If they haven't understood the questions themselves (what is the right time, right people, right thing), then evaluating their "importance" becomes impossible.
    *   "...are important in real life?" - "Important" is a common word, "real life" is also understandable.
    *   "Give one reason." - This is the reasoning part.

2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:**
    *   *Recall:* Remembering what the king's questions *were* (right time, right people, right thing). This is fundamental to answering correctly.
    *   *Reasoning:* Connecting those questions to "importance in real life." This requires abstract thought and relating it to their own experiences or observations. This is a higher-order thinking skill.

3.  **Specificity of the Required Answer:**
    *   The rubric states: "The king wanted to answer... the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with." This indicates that if they remember *these three*, they've done the recall part.
    *   "Any valid reason." This makes the reasoning part quite open-ended, which is good for varied responses but also means a simple "Yes, because it helps us make good decisions" or "Yes, because we always need to know what to do" would suffice.

4.  **Common Mistakes My Students Make:**
    *   **Not understanding the core content:** Many students, especially the struggling ones, might not have grasped *what* the king's questions actually *were* despite reading the passage. They might remember "king," "questions," but not the specifics.
    *   **Translating literally/limited vocabulary:** They might understand the question but struggle to articulate a reason in English. They might know the answer in Hindi but can't phrase it.
    *   **Providing a yes/no without a reason:** Some might just write "Yes" or "No" and skip the "give one reason" part, or repeat the question as the reason ("Yes, they are important because they are important").
    *   **Focusing on peripheral details:** They might talk about the king, the hermit, or other characters instead of directly addressing the *questions'* importance.
    *   **Lack of critical thinking/abstract connection:** Connecting a story's elements to "real life" is a hurdle for some who are used to rote learning or just summarising plot points.

**Estimated Percentages for Full Marks (Max Score: 1):**

*   **Struggling (35% of class):**
    *   Many would struggle to even understand "the king's questions" *in context* (i.e., *what* those questions were). Their reading comprehension for detail is weak.
    *   Even if they understood the superficial meaning of the question, articulating a valid reason in English would be a major hurdle.
    *   Likely to give a 'yes/no' without a reason, or a reason that is very vague/irrelevant.
    *   **My estimate: 5% full marks** (These might be the very top end of the struggling group who surprise me with a basic but valid reason like "Yes, because we should do good work.")

*   **Basic (35% of class):**
    *   They might recall that the king had questions, and might even vaguely remember the themes (time, people, actions) if we've discussed them thoroughly.
    *   They'd understand "important in real life."
    *   Their biggest challenge would be phrasing a clear, valid reason in complete sentences, though they might manage a fragmented one.
    *   A simple, direct reason like "Yes, because it helps us to make right decisions" or "Yes, we need to know what to do at the right time" is achievable.
    *   **My estimate: 30% full marks** (They'd often get the 'yes' and
