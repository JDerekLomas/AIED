Okay, Class 7, listen carefully. Today, we're going to write a short paragraph, just a few sentences, about something fun: "My Favourite Hobby."

Think about something you love to do when you have free time – maybe drawing, playing a game, helping your mother in the kitchen, or reading stories.

Here's what your paragraph needs to tell us:
1.  **What is your hobby?** (Example: "My favourite hobby is drawing.")
2.  **When do you do it?** (Example: "I draw every evening after I finish my homework.")
3.  **Why do you like it?** (Example: "I enjoy it because it makes me happy, and I can create new things.")

You need to write 4-5 sentences, just like my example, telling us clearly your hobby, when you do it, and why you enjoy it. Make sure all three parts are there!

Here’s my estimation for full marks:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Many would struggle with comprehending the prompt itself, especially "paragraph" and "enjoyable." They might write a single sentence or a list of hobbies. Reading their own writing to check against the three requirements would be very difficult.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires recalling a personal experience/preference and then articulating it with specific details, which is a step beyond simple recall for this group.
*   **Specificity:** They might name a hobby but miss the "when" or "why," or provide very basic, unelaborated answers (e.g., "I like playing because it's good").
*   **Common Mistakes:** Fragmented sentences, incorrect word order, major spelling/grammar errors making the meaning unclear, missing one or more of the required elements.

**basic: 30% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They would understand the core idea of "hobby" and "favourite." The structure of "when" and "why" might be challenging but manageable with support. They might read the prompt but struggle to keep all three requirements in mind while writing.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can usually identify a hobby and give simple reasons, but might struggle with structuring it into 4-5 coherent sentences.
*   **Specificity:** Many would get the hobby and a basic "why" (e.g., "it is fun"). The "when" might be generic or missing (e.g., "when I am free").
*   **Common Mistakes:** Short, choppy sentences; some grammatical errors; occasionally missing one component or having it implied rather than stated clearly. May only write 2-3 sentences.

**competent: 75% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They can read and understand the prompt well. They know what a paragraph is.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can easily recall a hobby and articulate reasons. Structuring a 4-5 sentence paragraph comes naturally.
*   **Specificity:** They will likely mention all three points clearly and provide some level of detail.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Minor grammatical errors; perhaps a slightly clunky sentence structure; might sometimes combine two ideas into one sentence instead of having distinct sentences for each part if not careful.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issue with understanding the prompt or the language.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can effortlessly articulate their hobby, when they do it, and why, often with good vocabulary and sentence variation.
*   **Specificity:** They will provide a clear, well-structured paragraph, hitting all three requirements and often adding a little extra detail or descriptive language.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very rare to make mistakes here. Maybe an occasional minor spelling error, or if they write *too* much and go slightly over the 4-5 sentence limit, but the content will be solid.
