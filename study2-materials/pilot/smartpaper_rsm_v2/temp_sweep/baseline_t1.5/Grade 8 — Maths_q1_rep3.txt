Here's my breakdown based on my experience:

**Thinking Process:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The equation `y + 9 = 4` is fairly universal in its mathematical symbols. "Find the value of y in the equation" might be a bit formal for many Hindi-medium students, but the numerical problem itself is clear. I would expect many to grasp the *what to do* even if the exact English phrasing is tricky. They've seen "find x" or "find the missing number" problems before.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is primarily a recall/application problem. They need to recall the concept of inverse operations (subtraction to undo addition) or transposing terms. The negative answer requires understanding operations with integers, which is often a hurdle.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The answer `-5` is very specific. No partial credit implied by the rubric.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Ignoring the Negative:** The biggest hurdle here will be arriving at a negative number. Many students, especially struggling and basic, will try to get a positive answer. They might do `9 - 4 = 5` and write `y = 5`.
    *   **Arithmetic Error:** Simple subtraction mistake `9 - 4`.
    *   **Transposition Error:** Doing `4 + 9 = 13`.
    *   **Not attempting:** Some struggling students might just leave it blank if they don't know how to start or deal with the negative number.
    *   **Solving without showing steps:** Competent and advanced students might get it quickly in their heads.

**Percentage Breakdown:**

*   **Struggling (35% of total students):**
    *   These students often struggle with the very concept of "what is an equation?" and operations with negative numbers.
    *   Many will likely do `9 - 4 = 5` and write `y = 5`.
    *   Some will try to add `9 + 4 = 13`.
    *   A significant portion might just stare at it or write a random number.
    *   Very few would correctly arrive at -5.
    *   **struggling: 0% full marks** (Even 1-2% would be an outlier; their core issue is not comfortable with integers and basic equation solving.)

*   **Basic (35% of total students):**
    *   These students understand the idea of isolating `y` but will likely falter at the integer arithmetic.
    *   The most common answer from this group will be `y = 5` (by doing `9 - 4`). They are focused on getting a positive answer.
    *   Some might remember `y = 4 - 9`, but then incorrectly calculate it as `5` or get stuck.
    *   A small fraction, perhaps those who recently practiced integers thoroughly, might get it.
    *   **basic: 5% full marks**

*   **Competent (20% of total students):**
    *   These students are generally comfortable with basic equation solving and have a better grasp of integers.
    *   Most will correctly transpose or apply inverse operations: `y = 4 - 9`.
    *   Some might still make a mental slip with `4 - 9` and write `5`, but the majority should get it.
    *   **competent: 70% full marks** (Still accounting for a few silly mistakes or integer confusion under exam pressure.)

*   **Advanced (10% of total students):**
    *   This is bread and butter for them. They will solve it quickly and correctly.
    *   They are adept with integer operations and equation solving.
    *   **advanced: 95% full marks** (Even the best students can make a rare calculation error under pressure, or copy it down wrong, so not 100%.)
