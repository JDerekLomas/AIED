Okay, let's break this down from my perspective in the classroom. This is a typical question, but the reality of my students' backgrounds makes it trickier than it looks on paper.

Here's my assessment:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   **Why:** Even if we've covered it, their ability to *read and understand the question itself* in English is a major hurdle. They might remember "Harappa" and "city," but translating that into a *specific key feature* and articulating it in English, even in simple terms, is very difficult. They might just write "good city" or "water" which isn't specific enough for full marks. Recall is there sometimes, but expression is limited.

**basic:** 30% full marks
*   **Why:** Many in this group will remember one key feature, perhaps the grid layout or the drainage system, because those are usually emphasized. They'll have a slightly better grasp of English to phrase it. However, they might miss keywords ("well-planned," "advanced," "baked bricks") or describe it vaguely. "They had streets" isn't enough, it needs "streets in a grid pattern." Some will recall the Hindi term and struggle to translate it accurately and succinctly.

**competent:** 70% full marks
*   **Why:** These students have a decent grasp of the content and can typically read the English question and formulate an answer. They're more likely to use specific terms like "grid pattern" or "baked bricks." They have better recall and better expression.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   **Why:** These students are usually confident with the material and have the language skills to articulate the answer clearly and correctly. They will remember details and specific vocabulary taught. They can recall easily and express themselves well in English.
