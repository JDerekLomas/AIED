Okay, this is a very common scenario in my Class 6 English class. Let's break down how my students would likely perform on "There are (some/any) apples in the basket."

**Understanding the Challenges for my Students:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The biggest hurdle. Many would struggle to *read* and *comprehend* the question itself, let alone the nuance between "some" and "any." The sentence structure "There are... in the basket" might be somewhat familiar, but the choice between "some/any" is abstract.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires recall of a grammar rule (some for affirmative statements, any for negative/questions) and the ability to apply it. For many, this rule might not have been explicitly taught or practiced enough to stick. For others, it's more about "sound" or "feel" if they have some exposure.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** It's a binary choice. One is definitively correct.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Choosing "any" because they've heard it used in questions ("Are there any apples?"). They might overgeneralize its use.
    *   Guessing. With two options, a significant portion would guess randomly.
    *   Not understanding what the question asks them to do (i.e., choose between the bracketed words).
    *   Simply copying one of the words without understanding why.

Let's estimate the percentages:

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** Many of these students struggle with basic alphabet recognition and forming simple words. Reading the sentence fully would be a challenge. Understanding the difference between 'some' and 'any' is beyond their current grasp. They'd mostly guess, or simply write the word they might recognize slightly better.
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks** (Mostly lucky guesses, or perhaps one or two might have dimly recalled it from a very recent lesson, but unlikely to apply it consciously).
*   **Basic (35% of class):** These students can read simple sentences but struggle with comprehension. They might have encountered 'some' and 'any' but haven't solidified the rule. They often translate mentally to Hindi, which doesn't always have a direct parallel for this specific distinction. They might get confused with 'any' being used in questions or negatives.
    *   **basic: 30% full marks** (Some would know the rule from a lesson, or 'some' might just "sound" more natural in this context due to exposure, but a good chunk would still struggle and guess or misapply).
*   **Competent (20% of class):** These students generally understand what is being asked and have a foundational grasp of basic grammar. They would have likely been taught the rule for 'some' in affirmative sentences.
    *   **competent: 80% full marks** (Most would recall and correctly apply the rule. A few might still make a careless mistake or momentarily confuse it).
*   **Advanced (10% of class):** These students pick up concepts quickly, often have some external exposure to English, and have a good understanding of grammar rules. This particular rule would be straightforward for them.
    *   **advanced: 100% full marks** (They would almost certainly get this correct. It's a fundamental distinction they would have mastered).
