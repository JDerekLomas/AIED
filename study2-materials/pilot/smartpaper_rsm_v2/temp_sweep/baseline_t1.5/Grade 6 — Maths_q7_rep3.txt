Here's my breakdown of how my Class 6 students would perform on this question, keeping all the context in mind:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** The entire question is a massive hurdle. "Temperature," "increases by," "per hour," "evening" – these are all complex terms in English for them. Even if I read it aloud and translated, the core concept might be lost due to the vocabulary.
* **Reasoning:** Even with translation, calculating time elapsed and then multiplying/adding sequentially is beyond them. They struggle with multi-step problems and often can't link an hourly change to a total change over several hours.
* **Common mistakes:** They would likely be completely lost. They might just pick out the numbers (30, 2, 4, 10) and try to do a random operation (+, -, x, /), or even just write one of the numbers. They wouldn't understand the relationship between time and temperature change.

**basic: 10% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** While they understand *some* English, "increases by 2°C per hour" and "what will be the temperature... at 4:00 in the evening?" are still tricky. They'd need me to read it aloud and explain key phrases, possibly multiple times.
* **Reasoning:** The biggest hurdle for this group is calculating the time elapsed (10 am to 4 pm). Many will count incorrectly or simply do 4 - 10 and get confused. Even if they get 6 hours, connecting that to 2°C per hour (i.e., 6 x 2) is a conceptual jump. Some might attempt 30 + 2 and stop there, not understanding it's a *cumulative* increase.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * Incorrectly calculating time elapsed (e.g., 5 hours, or just 4 hours).
    * Adding 2 to 30 and getting 32, not multiplying by the hours.
    * Getting 12 (6 x 2) but not adding it to 30.
    * Only attempting one step of the problem.

**competent: 50% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Most can follow the gist of the question, especially if I read it slowly. They might stumble on "per hour" but can deduce its meaning from the context of "increases by 2°C."
* **Reasoning:** They are capable of multi-step problems. Calculating time elapsed from 10 am to 4 pm is manageable for many of them, although some might still use fingers and need a moment. The multiplication (6 x 2) and addition (30 + 12) are within their capabilities.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * A few might still miscalculate the time elapsed by one hour.
    * Some might forget the initial temperature and just give the increase (12).
    * Minor calculation errors in addition or multiplication.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They can read and understand the question without much assistance.
* **Reasoning:** This is a straightforward multi-step problem for them. Calculating time elapsed (10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours) is easy. They'll readily perform the multiplication (6 x 2 = 12) and addition (30 + 12 = 42). They understand the cumulative nature of the temperature increase.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * Very rarely, a careless calculation error.
    * Possibly overlooking the 'initial temperature' if rushing, though unlikely for this group.
