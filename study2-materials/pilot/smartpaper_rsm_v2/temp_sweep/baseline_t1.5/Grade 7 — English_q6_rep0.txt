Here's my assessment based on my experience:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 5% full marks
competent: 50% full marks
advanced: 90% full marks

**Thinking process:**

*   **Language barriers:** For my struggling and even many basic students, "describes the poet's writing style" itself is a challenge. They might not understand "style" in this context. They're more likely to focus on literal meaning or recall specific events from the poem rather than meta-textual analysis. Their vocabulary for descriptive words related to writing style (simple, direct, evocative) would be extremely limited, if present at all.

*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question leans heavily towards reasoning, coupled with the need for specific vocabulary. It requires them to have processed the poem, identified its characteristics, and then translated those characteristics into a suitable descriptor. Many students in these lower proficiency groups are primarily recall-focused (What happened in the poem? Who are the characters?). Analyzing *how* the poem is written is a higher-order thinking skill.

*   **Specificity of the required answer:** "A suitable and relevant word" means they need to come up with *one* appropriate word. While a word like "simple" or "easy" might seem straightforward, it requires them to abstract that idea from the entire poem. For students who struggle to articulate complete sentences, a single appropriate abstract adjective can be a significant hurdle. They might use an adjective that describes the *content* (e.g., "sad," "happy") rather than the *style*.

*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Misunderstanding "style":** They might think it refers to the genre of the poem, the poet's name, or even the theme.
    *   **Describing content, not style:** "The poem is sad," "It is about nature," "The poet feels happy." These are very common responses.
    *   **Lack of vocabulary:** Even if they grasp "style," they won't have words like "descriptive," "evocative," "narrative," "conversational," or even "simple" readily available in the context of writing. They might say "good writing" or "bad writing."
    *   **Leaving it blank:** Especially among the struggling group.
    *   **Random word from the poem:** Picking a word from the poem that might sound important.

**Breakdown by group:**

*   **Struggling (0%):** Zero chance. They won't understand "writing style" and won't have the vocabulary or analytical skills. They might write the poet's name or something completely off-topic.
*   **Basic (5%):** A very small fraction might stumble upon "simple" if the poem is genuinely straightforward, or "direct" if it's very plain language. This would likely be an educated guess or due to some prior (rare) exposure. They would mostly struggle with understanding the question or providing a relevant answer.
*   **Competent (50%):** This group has a fair chance. They generally understand the question. They might come up with "simple," "descriptive," "easy to understand," "narrative." They might struggle if the writing style is nuanced or if their vocabulary for literary terms is still developing. Some might give an answer that's *close* but not quite a single, precise adjective, e.g., "He writes in a way that makes you feel it." We're looking for one word.
*   **Advanced (90%):** This group is expected to understand "writing style" and recall relevant vocabulary. They'd likely offer words like "descriptive," "evocative," "simple," "direct," "narrative," "figurative" (if applicable), or "conversational." The 10% miss might be due to a specific poem having a particularly difficult-to-categorize style, or if they overthink and try to be too clever instead of finding the most obvious appropriate word.
