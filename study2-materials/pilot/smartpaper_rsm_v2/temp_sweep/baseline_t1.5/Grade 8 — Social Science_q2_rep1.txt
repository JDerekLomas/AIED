Alright, let's break this down from my perspective in the classroom. This is a typical question we'd encounter, and the challenges are quite clear.

First, the *question itself* for students with limited English: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."
*   "Describe" - easy enough, most understand this means 'tell me about it'.
*   "Key feature" - crucial point, important part.
*   "Harappan Civilization" - This is where recall of the chapter title and general topic comes in. If they spaced out on the Harappan part, they're lost.
*   "Urban planning" - This is the trickiest term. Many might struggle with "urban." "Planning" they might get as 'how they made things.' Together, it means 'how they built their cities.' I'd definitely be translating "urban planning" in class or giving them simpler synonyms during revision.

Now, for the *answer*: Any of the listed features are good. "Well-planned grid layout," "advanced drainage system," "use of baked bricks," "division into citadel and lower town."

Let's think about my students:

*   **Language barriers:** The biggest hurdle. Even if they know the facts in Hindi, articulating them precisely in English can be tough. They might use simplified terms or miss key vocabulary.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is purely recall. They either remember it or they don't. No reasoning required here, just knowledge retrieval.
*   **Specificity:** The required answer is fairly specific. "Good streets" won't cut it, it needs to be "well-planned grid layout." "Good drains" isn't enough, it's "advanced drainage system." This level of specificity often trips them up.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Partial answers:** Knowing 'they had good roads' but not 'grid pattern'.
    *   **Misremembering details:** Mixing up Harappan features with another civilization.
    *   **Vocabulary struggle:** Not knowing how to express the concept in English even if they know the idea in Hindi (e.g., they know "naali" but struggle with "drainage system").
    *   **Not understanding "urban planning":** Describing Harappan artifacts instead of city structure.
    *   **Simply not studying/remembering:** A significant portion will simply not have this information stored.

Given all this, here's my breakdown:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 10% full marks
competent: 50% full marks
advanced: 90% full marks
