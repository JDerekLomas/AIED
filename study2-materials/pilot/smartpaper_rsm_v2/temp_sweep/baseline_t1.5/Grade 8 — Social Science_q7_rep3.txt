This is a common question, and one we spend a fair bit of time on, given its importance. However, the exact phrasing of the rubric and the expected specific details can be a challenge.

Here's my breakdown:

**Struggling (35% of students):**
* **Language barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Contribute to the expansion of British power" can be hard for them to fully grasp, even if they know some keywords.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall "Battle of Plassey" and "British won," but connecting it specifically to "political dominance/control over Bengal" and "puppet nawab Mir Jafar" requires a level of detail and conceptual understanding they often lack. They might just say "British became powerful."
* **Common Mistakes:** "British won," "Mir Jafar was there," "Siraj-ud-Daulah lost," without explaining the *consequence* of political control.

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*(A few might fluke it if they somehow remember Mir Jafar's role and link it to British control, perhaps from a direct memory cue from class discussions.)*

**Basic (35% of students):**
* **Language barrier:** They'll understand the question's core, but expressing the nuanced answer in English might still be tough.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall that the British gained a lot of power. They'll likely mention the British victory and that they became stronger. Some might even recall Mir Jafar's name.
* **Specifics:** Getting to "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal" *and* "placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab" for full marks is the challenge. They might say "British took control of Bengal" but miss the puppet nawab part, or just say "British got rich" which isn't the political dominance asked for.

**basic: 20% full marks**
*(They'll get most of the idea, but the precise wording and linking of "puppet nawab" to "political dominance" is the key. About 1 in 5 might nail both components.)*

**Competent (20% of students):**
* **Language barrier:** They can read and understand the question well.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall the details of Plassey, including Siraj-ud-Daulah, Mir Jafar, and the British victory. They generally understand the concept of political control.
* **Specifics:** They are very likely to mention the victory leading to control over Bengal and the installation of Mir Jafar. The connection to "political dominance" should be clear to them. They've likely been drilled on this connection.

**competent: 70% full marks**
*(Most of them should be able to articulate both parts of the rubric. The few who miss out might forget the "puppet nawab" detail or not articulate the "political dominance" as explicitly, focusing more on economic benefits which, while related, isn't the primary point of the rubric.)*

**Advanced (10% of students):**
* **Language barrier:** No issue at all.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They grasp the full implications and historical significance.
* **Specifics:** They will very clearly explain how the victory allowed the British to install Mir Jafar as a puppet, giving them effective political and economic control over Bengal, which then became a base for further expansion. They might even elaborate slightly more than required, but certainly hit all the key points.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*(They are highly likely to get full marks. The 5% margin is just for an occasional moment of oversight or misremembering a specific detail under exam pressure.)*
