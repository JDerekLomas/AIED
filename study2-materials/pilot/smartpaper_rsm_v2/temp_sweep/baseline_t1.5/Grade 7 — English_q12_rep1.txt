Okay, this is a very common type of question we encounter. Let's break it down based on my experience with Class 7 students from similar backgrounds.

First, the core task: "The wind blew the leaves away." to "The leaves were blown away by the wind."

Let's consider the elements involved:
1.  **Identifying Subject, Verb, Object** in the active sentence.
2.  **Knowing the structure of passive voice** (Object + be verb + Past Participle + by + Subject).
3.  **Correctly changing the verb 'blew'** to its past participle 'blown'.
4.  **Selecting the correct form of 'to be'** ('were' because 'leaves' is plural and the original tense is past simple).
5.  **Understanding 'away'** as part of the phrasal verb/adverbial particle.

**Language barriers (many can't read English well):** This is a huge factor.
*   **Reading:** Many struggling students would struggle just to read and comprehend "The wind blew the leaves away." even if they know the individual words. The sentence structure might throw them off.
*   **Vocabulary:** 'Blew' and 'leaves' might be known, but 'away' could be tricky. More importantly, understanding the *concept* of active/passive voice requires an abstract understanding of agency that is often lost in translation for Hindi-medium learners.
*   **Grammar Terminology:** Active Voice, Passive Voice, Past Participle – these terms themselves are complex and often not fully grasped, even if the concept is taught. We'd usually teach with examples rather than heavy reliance on terminology.

**Recall vs. Reasoning:**
*   **Recall:** Students need to recall the 'rules' or common patterns for passive voice. They also need to recall the past participle of 'blow'.
*   **Reasoning:** They need to apply these rules to a specific sentence, understanding the tense and subject-verb agreement for the 'to be' verb. This involves a degree of analytical thinking.

**How specific the required answer is:** Very specific. One wrong word (e.g., "was" instead of "were," or "blowed" instead of "blown") and it's incorrect. Even missing "by the wind" would make it partially correct but not full marks in a strict rubric.

**Common mistakes my students make:**
*   **Incorrect Past Participle:** "blowed" is a very common one, or sometimes just repeating "blew."
*   **Incorrect 'to be' verb:** Using 'was' for 'leaves', or using 'is/are' (present tense) due to confusion.
*   **Missing 'by the wind':** Often, students might get "The leaves were blown away," but forget the agent.
*   **Confusing parts of the sentence:** Randomly rearranging words without following the structure.
*   **Maintaining active structure:** Some might try to rephrase in active voice but using different words, showing a lack of understanding of the core concept.
*   **Translating literally from Hindi:** Trying to make a direct word-for-word conversion which often leads to grammatically incorrect English.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   They would likely struggle to read the sentence fluently, let alone understand the grammatical concept.
*   Identifying the subject, verb, and object would be a challenge.
*   The concept of 'past participle' is usually beyond them at this stage for a new verb like 'blow'.
*   They might produce something completely random or just copy the sentence.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   They might understand the individual words and get a gist of the sentence.
*   They *might* have some recall of passive voice structure but would struggle with the application, especially with irregular verbs.
*   Common mistakes would be using "was blown" (forgetting 'leaves' is plural), "blewed" or "blowed" instead of "blown."
*   The phrase "by the wind" would often be omitted or placed incorrectly.
*   10% would be those who have just managed to grasp the basics through repetition and perhaps this specific type of sentence was heavily drilled.

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   They would understand the concept and recall the general structure.
*   The main challenge would be the past participle of 'blow' and correctly applying 'were'.
*   About half of them would correctly use 'blown' and 'were'.
*   Some might forget "by the wind," but a good portion would include it.
*   They often learn these transformation rules through practice and pattern recognition.
