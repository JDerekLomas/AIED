Okay, let's break this down based on my experience teaching Class 6 Social Science in a government school in India, particularly with students from similar backgrounds.

First, let's re-evaluate the question and the rubric from the students' perspective.

**The Question:** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

**My understanding of the rubric (and how I'd mentally apply it):**
*   **Part 1: Mention any two natural resources.** This is a direct recall. They don't need to be unique or rare, just common ones associated with Rajasthan. (e.g., water, minerals like marble/copper/zinc/salt, sand, sunlight, wind).
*   **Part 2: Explain how ONE influences lives.** This requires a bit of reasoning and linkage. It can be a simple explanation.

**Analysis of student performance:**

1.  **Language Barriers:** This is a *major* hurdle.
    *   "Mention any two natural resources..." - "Natural resources" itself might be understood if taught well in Hindi first (प्राकृतिक संसाधन - Prakritik Sansadhan), but processing "mention" and "any two" in English quickly will trip up the struggling and some basic students.
    *   "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there" - "influences the lives" is complex English for many. They might get "lives" (जीवन - Jeevan), but "influences" (प्रभावित करता है - Prabhavit karta hai) is difficult to grasp immediately from the English word itself.
    *   Many will struggle to *read* the entire question correctly, let alone understand it comprehensively. They might pick up keywords like "Rajasthan" and "resources" but miss the "explain" part or the "how it influences" part.

2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:**
    *   **Recall (naming resources):** Most students *might* be able to name one or two if the topic has been drilled adequately (e.g., "salt," "sand," "marble" are often associated with Rajasthan). This is easier than the second part.
    *   **Reasoning (explanation):** This is where most will falter. Connecting a resource (like water) to "influences the lives" (agriculture, daily needs, travel to fetch water) requires a level of thought and sentence construction that is beyond many struggling and basic students in English. They might know the *facts* in Hindi, but articulating them in English is hard.

3.  **Specificity:**
    *   Naming two resources isn't too specific. Many correct answers exist.
    *   The explanation doesn't need to be extremely detailed, but it *does* require linking the resource to people's daily lives. A one-word answer won't suffice for the explanation.

4.  **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Incomplete answers:** Naming only one resource, or naming two but not explaining any.
    *   **Hindi answers:** Answering fully in Hindi because they understood the question but couldn't formulate the English response. (As an experienced teacher, I'd often give *partial* credit for this in initial assessments, but for a "full marks" scenario, it has to be English).
    *   **General answers:** For the explanation, saying "it is useful" without explaining *how*.
    *   **Misunderstanding "natural resources":** Listing man-made things or abstract concepts. (Less common in Class 6 if the topic was covered, but still possible).
    *   **Transcription errors:** For students who struggle with writing English, even if they know the answer, writing words like "influences" or even "resources" can be error-prone, making their answer hard to decipher or mark down.

Given all these factors, here's my estimation for full marks (meaning correct resources *and* a clear, correct explanation, all in English):

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*(They will struggle to read, understand, and articulate in English. They might write one resource or write everything in Hindi, but not fully satisfy the English requirement of the rubric.)*

**basic: 5% full marks**
*(A very small number might, through luck or better-than-average language skills for their group, manage to identify two resources and give a very simple, somewhat grammatically correct explanation in English. Many will struggle with the explanation part in English.)*

**competent: 40% full marks**
*(This group generally understands the concepts and has better English. They will likely name two resources correctly. The challenge will be articulating the "influence" clearly and grammatically. Many will get close, but minor English errors or slightly vague
