Here's my breakdown for the given problem:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
* **Language Barrier:** A significant hurdle. Many won't fully grasp "Find the value of 'y' in the equation." Even reading `y + 9 = 4` can be challenging for those with limited English.
* **Concept of Negative Numbers:** This is the biggest conceptual leap. Most struggling students are comfortable with operations that result in positive integers. `4 - 9` leading to `-5` is often where they get stuck. They might try to rearrange it as `9 - 4 = 5` because that's a more 'natural' operation for them.
* **Basic Equation Solving:** The idea of isolating `y` by 'moving' `+9` to the other side as `-9` is a step many haven't solidly internalized, especially when it leads to a negative result.
* **Common Mistakes:** `y = 9 - 4 = 5`, or simply being unable to attempt it at all. Some might just write 'y' and look lost.

**basic: 30% full marks**
* **Language Barrier:** They might understand "Find the value of 'y'" but the full sentence could still be a bit slow to process. The equation itself (`y + 9 = 4`) is relatively simple in its structure.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This largely relies on recall of the inverse operation concept. They know that to undo `+9`, you do `-9`.
* **Concept of Negative Numbers:** This is still a tricky area. Some will correctly perform `4 - 9`, but a good chunk might still stumble and revert to `9 - 4 = 5`, or perform the subtraction correctly but forget the negative sign. They might think "Can't subtract a bigger number from a smaller one."
* **Common Mistakes:** `y = 5` is very common. Sometimes, they might correctly do `4-9` but get the sign wrong, or just leave it blank if they get stuck on the negative outcome.

**competent: 80% full marks**
* **Language Barrier:** They will likely understand the question and the equation without significant difficulty.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is primarily recall of basic linear equation solving principles. They understand inverse operations.
* **Concept of Negative Numbers:** They are generally comfortable working with negative integers in basic arithmetic operations. They have practiced similar problems where the result is negative.
* **Common Mistakes:** Occasional calculation error, but generally, they will get to `-5`. A rare mistake could be transcribing the number incorrectly.

**advanced: 100% full marks**
* **Language Barrier:** No issue at all.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is a fundamental concept they have mastered. It's instant recall for them.
* **Concept of Negative Numbers:** They are very comfortable with all integer operations.
* **Common Mistakes:** Extremely unlikely to make any mistake on this type of problem. They see this as a very straightforward question.
