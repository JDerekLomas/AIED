This is a common type of word problem, and I've seen a wide range of performance on it. Here's my breakdown:

*   **Language barriers:** This is a major hurdle. Even though the numbers are simple, understanding "temperature increases by 2°C *per hour*" and relating "10 am" to "4 pm" requires comprehension of English vocabulary and phrasing. "Per hour" might be confused or simply not registered. "Increase" is usually understood through context or basic knowledge of temperature. The biggest challenge would be interpreting "4:00 in the evening." Many might just see "4" and "10" and directly subtract or add them without understanding time.

*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** It's primarily reasoning, but basic time-telling (elapsed time) and multiplication/addition are recall. The core reasoning is identifying the *change per unit of time* and applying it to the total *change in time*.

*   **Specificity of Answer:** The required answer is a single number (the final temperature). The intermediate step (time elapsed) is crucial for full marks.

*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Time Calculation:** This is the biggest one.
        *   Just subtracting 4 from 10 (or vice-versa) to get 6 directly, *without understanding the clock.*
        *   Counting on fingers from 10 to 4 (on a 12-hour clock) and making a mistake (e.g., getting 5 hours if they don't count 10 itself as 0 or starting from 11).
        *   Confusion with "evening" or PM/AM concept if not explicitly taught recently.
        *   Assuming a 24-hour clock for calculation without explicitly thinking about it.
    *   **"Per hour" misinterpretation:** Some might just add 2 to 30 once, thinking "per hour" means "at the end of one hour."
    *   **Incorrect operation:** Some might multiply 30 by 2 or add 30 and 2 without finding the time.
    *   **Calculation error:** Even if the logic is right, a simple multiplication error (e.g., 6 x 2 = 10 instead of 12).
    *   **Ignoring initial temperature:** Some might just give 6 * 2 = 12 as the answer.

Here's my prediction for full marks:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 25% full marks
competent: 70% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
