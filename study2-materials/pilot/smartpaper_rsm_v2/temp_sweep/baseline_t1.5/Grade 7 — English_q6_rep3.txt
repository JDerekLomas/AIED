Okay, this is a very common question type, and I've seen how my students navigate it. Let's break it down by group.

The question "Describes the poet's writing style" is a reasoning-based question, not pure recall, as it requires them to analyze the text and infer characteristics. However, the one-word answer for a full mark is very specific, yet broad enough that many "right" answers exist.

Here's my breakdown:

*   **Language barriers:** A big hurdle. Many will struggle just to *understand* "writing style" and "describes." They might mistake it for asking what the poem is *about*. Even if they grasp the concept, finding the right English word can be tough.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** It's reasoning, which is harder. They haven't memorized a "writing style" for a poem. They need to look at the words, sentence structure, and imagery used.
*   **Specificity:** The fact that *any* suitable word (simple, descriptive, informal, direct, vivid, engaging, clear, etc.) gets the mark is a big advantage. If it had to be *one specific* word, scores would plummet.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Answering what the poem is *about* (e.g., "It is about a dog").
    *   Describing the *mood* of the poem instead of the writing *style* (e.g., "It is sad").
    *   Not being able to articulate the style even if they vaguely feel it (e.g., "He writes nicely").
    *   Choosing an unrelated or incorrect word due to limited vocabulary.
    *   Leaving it blank if they don't understand "writing style."

Let's assume the poem is something like a simple narrative or descriptive poem, common in Class 7 textbooks, where "simple" or "descriptive" would be apt answers.

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*They will likely not understand "writing style" at all. Even if they get the gist, articulating it with a single, relevant English word is beyond their current capacity. They might write something completely off-topic or leave it blank.*

**basic: 10% full marks**
*Some of these students might have a basic grasp of "style" if I've taught it directly and used simple examples. They might understand that it refers to *how* the poet writes. If the poem is particularly straightforward, a few might intuit "simple" or "easy to understand." A very small number might pick up on strong descriptive words and try to say "descriptive," but often they won't know the exact word.*

**competent: 50% full marks**
*These students are more likely to understand "writing style" and can connect it to observations about the poem. They might notice simple language or vivid imagery. Words like "simple," "clear," "descriptive," or "easy" are within their vocabulary. They still might not always hit the most precise word, but given the rubric accepts many, their chances are reasonable. Some might still get confused with 'mood' or 'theme' but many will attempt to describe the 'how.'*

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*These students generally understand abstract concepts like "writing style." They have a broader vocabulary to choose from and can analyze the language more effectively. They would likely identify suitable words like "descriptive," "simple," "direct," "evocative," or "vivid." The openness of the rubric makes it highly probable they'd score a mark, even if they don't pick the 'best' possible word.*
