Here's my breakdown based on experience:

**struggling: 10% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** This is a major hurdle. Even "base" and "height" might be understood, but "area" might be a new word for some or confused with "perimeter." Reading the question and extracting the numbers might be challenging.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is primarily a recall task of a specific formula. The struggling students often lack this foundational recall for formulas they haven't explicitly memorized and practiced repeatedly.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * Might try to just add or multiply the numbers without a formula (8+6, 8*6).
    * Might remember a formula for *some* shape, but not specifically a triangle.
    * Might struggle with the "1/2" part, either forgetting it or making calculation errors with fractions.
    * Even if they understand "half," dividing 8 by 2 or 6 by 2 might be a mental challenge.
* **Why 10%?** There might be a handful who have somehow internalized this particular formula from a previous year or a very recent lesson, or a lucky guess (e.g., trying base*height/2 because it "feels" right).

**basic: 40% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They can generally read and comprehend simple English sentences and mathematical terms, especially "base," "height," and "area" if introduced previously. They might still need a moment to translate if they primarily think in Hindi.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They've likely been introduced to the formula for the area of a triangle. The challenge is often *recalling* it accurately, especially the `1/2` part. They understand that area involves multiplication of base and height.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * Forgetting the `1/2` (so they might just do `base × height`). This is a very common one.
    * Making calculation errors, especially with the `1/2` or multiplication if the numbers were larger.
    * Confusing area with perimeter formula for a rectangle or square.
* **Why 40%?** A significant portion would remember "base times height," but the "half" often gets dropped. Those who have a clear conceptual understanding or recently revised it would get it.

**competent: 85% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They can easily read and understand the question.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They have generally memorized common geometric formulas and can apply them directly. This is a straightforward recall and application for them.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * Very rare, but a momentary lapse of memory for the `1/2`.
    * A small calculation error, though less likely with such simple numbers.
* **Why 85%?** The vast majority would know this formula and apply it correctly. A very small percentage might have an off day or a momentary brain freeze on this specific formula.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issues at all.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is a very basic recall task for them. They would instantly retrieve the formula and apply it without any difficulty.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * Almost none. Perhaps an extremely rare oversight or misread of a number (though unlikely with such clear values).
* **Why 95%?** For advanced students, this is a "given." The only reason it isn't 100% is the unpredictability of any human test-taker – a very minor slip of concentration, but highly unlikely.
