Here's my estimation for full marks, considering the context:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** Even if they vaguely recall "animal story," the requirement for "imparts a moral lesson" and the precise definition will be completely out of their reach due to language barriers and recall issues. They might point to pictures of animals if prompted but not articulate a definition.

**basic:** 10% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** Some might recall "animal story" and *possibly* "lesson." However, connecting both accurately and articulating it clearly in English as a definition will be challenging. They often struggle with sentence construction and finding the right vocabulary. The "imparts a moral lesson" part is particularly tricky as "moral" might not be a familiar term or they might just say "good/bad" in simpler terms without hitting the "moral" aspect precisely. A few might have seen this explicitly defined and practiced.

**competent:** 50% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** This group generally understands the core concept. They will likely mention animals and a lesson. The challenge for them will be the precise phrasing: "short story," "typically uses animals," and "imparts a moral lesson." Some might just say "animals teach a lesson." I'd expect about half to get all the key elements phrased well enough to meet the rubric. They might struggle with "imparts" and use "teaches" instead, which might still be acceptable, but hitting "moral" is key.

**advanced:** 90% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** This group often has a better vocabulary and can recall definitions with reasonable accuracy. They would likely have encountered and perhaps even studied fables more deeply. Their ability to formulate a complete and accurate sentence, incorporating all the required elements, is much higher. The 10% miss might be due to a slip in memory or slightly imperfect phrasing for one of the elements.
