This is a very common type of question in our Social Science exams, often linked to a map activity or a chapter on resources. Here's how I'd expect my students to perform:

*   **Language barriers:** The question itself is fairly simple English. The names of natural resources might be known in Hindi first (e.g., "pani" for water, "ret" for sand, "sangmarmar" for marble, "namak" for salt). Writing them in English will be the main challenge for struggling and basic students.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** Naming two resources is pure recall. Explaining the influence requires a basic level of reasoning, linking the resource to everyday life. For example, water leads to farming or scarcity; marble leads to building materials and jobs; salt leads to livelihoods and food preservation.
*   **Specificity:** Naming two resources is quite specific. The explanation is less so, allowing for varied but relevant answers.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Naming only one resource.
    *   Naming resources not found in Rajasthan (e.g., coal, oil, unless they relate to 'sunlight' or 'wind' for energy).
    *   Spelling mistakes in English.
    *   Forgetting to explain the influence, or giving a very vague explanation.
    *   Mixing up the influence of two resources.

Let's break down the expected scores:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   Many would struggle to read and fully comprehend the question, especially the "influences the lives" part. They might name one resource, often sand or water, but articulating the influence in English would be very difficult for most. Even if they know the Hindi, translating it to a coherent English sentence is a big jump.

**basic:** 30% full marks
*   Most would be able to recall one or two natural resources from Rajasthan (like water, marble, sand, salt). They might manage to write down two names, perhaps with spelling errors. The "explanation" part would be where many falter. Some might give a very simple, broken English sentence like "Water is for farming" or "Marble is for houses." Getting a full, clear explanation for *one* of them is the key, and that's still a stretch for many at this level.

**competent:** 75% full marks
*   These students would typically name two correct resources without much trouble. They've likely seen and discussed this in class. They would also be able to explain the influence of one resource, forming reasonably clear sentences, perhaps like "Water is scarce, so people have to save it and farmers grow less crops" or "Marble is used for building houses and temples, creating jobs for people."

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   These students would breeze through this. They'd confidently name two (or more) resources and provide a well-structured explanation for one, demonstrating a good grasp of vocabulary and sentence construction. They might even add extra detail or examples. They'd be least affected by language barriers.
