Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 7 English students in a government school, keeping in mind the demographics and challenges.

**Analysis of the Item:**

*   **Complexity:** Active to Passive voice transformation for simple past tense is a core grammatical concept taught at this level.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** It requires both recall of the passive voice structure (object + 'was/were' + past participle + 'by' + subject) and the ability to identify the components in the active sentence and transform the verb.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The answer is quite specific ("The leaves were blown away by the wind."). Minor deviations (e.g., missing "by the wind") might lose marks depending on how strict the marking is, but the core transformation of "blew" to "were blown" is crucial.
*   **Language Barriers:** This is a major hurdle. Many struggling students won't understand the active sentence itself or the instructions "Active Voice to Passive Voice." Even if they grasp the words, the concept of "voice" can be abstract.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Incorrect auxiliary verb (e.g., "are blown" instead of "were blown").
    *   Incorrect past participle (e.g., "blew" instead of "blown").
    *   Missing "by the wind" (especially if they just focus on changing the verb).
    *   Trying to rephrase the sentence completely instead of transforming the voice.
    *   Not attempting it at all due to lack of understanding.

**Percentage Predictions:**

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** This group struggles with basic vocabulary and sentence comprehension. The concept of "voice" will likely be completely alien. They might identify "leaves" and "wind" but not know what to do with "blew." Even if I've taught it multiple times, they often can't apply it independently.
    **struggling: 0% full marks** (Maybe 1-2% might randomly get "blown" but fail the rest, not enough for full marks).

*   **Basic (35% of class):** These students might understand the individual words and the instruction. They know some grammar rules but often make mistakes with application or recall. They might get the "leaves were blown" part but miss "away" or "by the wind," or use "are blown." They'd likely attempt it, but accuracy would be low for full marks.
    **basic: 5% full marks** (A few who paid very close attention or happened to practice this specific type of sentence recently might get it. More would get partial marks).

*   **Competent (20% of class):** This group generally understands the concepts and can apply them with reasonable accuracy. They would have studied the rules and practiced. They are more likely to correctly identify the components and apply the formula. Their main challenge might be minor slips like forgetting "away" or "by the wind" or making a tense error.
    **competent: 60% full marks** (They have a good grasp, but occasional errors can still occur, or they might forget the complete phrase "by the wind").

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** These students typically pick up concepts quickly, remember rules, and apply them correctly. They would have encountered this structure multiple times and likely feel confident. They'd probably get it without much thought.
    **advanced: 95% full marks** (The only reason it's not 100% is the possibility of a silly mistake under test pressure or misreading something minor, which is rare for them on this kind of item).
