This is a good question for Class 8, as it directly tests recall of a key historical feature. However, the English medium for a Hindi-medium background will be the biggest hurdle.

Here's my breakdown:

**Common Mistakes & Challenges:**

*   **Language:** "Urban planning" itself might be difficult for many to grasp. They might understand "शहरों का बनावट" (city structure) but struggle with the specific term.
*   **Recall:** While we teach it, direct, specific recall of *one key feature* can be tough if not drilled repeatedly. They might remember fragments.
*   **Specificity:** Just saying "good cities" or "they built houses" won't get full marks. They need to identify a *key feature* like a grid pattern or drainage.
*   **Confusion:** Some might confuse Harappan features with later civilizations if their understanding isn't solid.
*   **Spelling:** Even if they know the answer, spelling "drainage," "citadel," or "baked bricks" in English could be a struggle for many.

**Percentage breakdown:**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   Most will struggle with the English prompt itself.
    *   Even if they've heard about Harappan cities, extracting "one key feature" and articulating it correctly in English is a major challenge. They might say something very general like "big cities" or "they lived there."
    *   **Full Marks: 0-2%** (Only if they manage to pick up a key term during the class and are lucky with spelling/grammar, or if they happen to remember "drainage system" as a specific phrase.)

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   They might understand the prompt in a general sense, or with some teacher clarification (if it were an oral test).
    *   They will recall some information about Harappa.
    *   The challenge will be *identifying a specific key feature* and *writing it down clearly and correctly in English*. They might get part of it right but lack the precision or English phrasing for full marks. For example, "They had drain." is close but not quite "advanced drainage system."
    *   **Full Marks: 10-15%** (Those who have a slightly better grasp of English and recall one of the more easily rememberable features like the drainage or grid pattern. They might still have grammatical errors but convey the core idea.)

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   They would understand the question fully.
    *   They would recall the features accurately.
    *   Their ability to articulate one specific feature in English, with reasonable accuracy in terms of vocabulary and grammar, would be good. They might choose grid layout, drainage, or citadel/lower town.
    *   **Full Marks: 60-70%** (They understand the concept and can articulate it, though minor English phrasing issues might still exist for a few, leading to not quite perfect phrasing for some.)

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   These students are likely to grasp the nuances of the question.
    *   They will recall the information clearly and be able to select and articulate a key feature (e.g., "the systematic grid pattern of streets and houses," or "an advanced and elaborate drainage system with covered drains") with good English construction and spelling.
    *   **Full Marks: 90-100%** (They have strong recall and good English proficiency.)
