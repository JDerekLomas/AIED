Let's break down how my Class 7 students would likely perform on this question.

The question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason" requires a few steps:
1.  **Understanding the King's Questions:** This relies on recalling or understanding the core themes of the "Three Questions" story (the right time, the right people, the right thing). Many struggling students might not remember these specifics, or might struggle to link "the right time to do everything" to the story's main questions.
2.  **Relating to "Real Life":** This requires a conceptual leap from the story's context to their own lives, which can be challenging for those with limited abstract reasoning skills or who are used to rote memorization.
3.  **Formulating a Reason:** Even if they understand the first two points, expressing a coherent reason in English is a significant hurdle for most. The expected answer isn't a simple yes/no.
4.  **Language Barrier:** The phrase "important in real life" is common but might still be slightly abstract for the struggling cohort. "Give one reason" is clear.

Given the rubric (understanding the king's questions and any valid reason), this isn't *just* recall; it's recall *plus* simple reasoning/personal connection.

Here's my prediction:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Many wouldn't fully grasp "important in real life" or struggle to connect it meaningfully to the text beyond surface-level recall if they even remember the questions.
*   **Recall:** While they might recall the story's existence, remembering the *specific* "three questions" and understanding their implications would be very difficult.
*   **Reasoning:** Even if prompted with the questions, formulating a reason in English would be near impossible for this group without significant scaffolding. They might just say "yes" but fail to give a reason.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They might understand "important in real life" but struggle to articulate a reason clearly in English.
*   **Recall:** Some might remember the general idea of the three questions (e.g., "what to do," "when to do").
*   **Reasoning:** A very few might manage a very simple reason like "Yes, because it helps us to make good decisions" or "Yes, because we need to know what to do." They might just write "Yes, it is important." and forget the "reason" part or give a very vague one. The 10% assumes a small fraction who happen to get a valid, simple reason out clearly.

**competent: 60% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Generally understand the question well.
*   **Recall:** Most would remember the three questions from the story, at least in their essence.
*   **Reasoning:** Many would be able to connect the questions to real-life concepts like "making good decisions," "doing the right thing," "not wasting time." They would likely provide a reason like, "Yes, because knowing the right time helps us to be successful" or "Yes, because we need to know what is important to do." Some might be a bit too brief or slightly imprecise but still score.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue understanding the question.
*   **Recall:** They would clearly recall the three questions.
*   **Reasoning:** They would easily articulate a valid, well-reasoned answer, often with good vocabulary. For example, "Yes, the king's questions are profoundly important in real life because they guide us in making prudent choices, ensuring efficiency, and fostering positive relationships, all crucial for personal success and societal well-being." They might offer a slightly more complex or thoughtful reason, showing a deeper understanding. The 10% not getting full marks might be due to a slight oversight in their reason, or perhaps focusing on one question rather than the general applicability.
