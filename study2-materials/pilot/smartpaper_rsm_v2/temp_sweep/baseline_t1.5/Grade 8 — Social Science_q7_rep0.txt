Here's my breakdown, keeping in mind the classroom reality:

**Struggling (35% of class):** 0% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** Many won't even be able to fully comprehend the question, let alone frame an answer in English. "Contribute to," "expansion," "political dominance" are challenging terms.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires recall of a specific event and its immediate political consequence. They might remember "Battle of Plassey" and "British won," but connecting it to *political dominance* or *puppet nawab* is a step too far for most in this group.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Vague answers like "British got stronger" or "British ruled India" without specific mention of Bengal or political control. They might confuse it with other battles or general British presence.

**Basic (35% of class):** 5% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** Some will grasp the core of the question, but expressing it clearly in English is still a hurdle. They might use a mix of Hindi and broken English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might remember that Mir Jafar became Nawab after Plassey and was controlled by the British. The connection to "control over Bengal" is what we're looking for. Some might make this link, but many will struggle with the specific phrasing needed for full marks.
*   **Common Mistakes:** "British took over," "Mir Jafar became king, but British told him what to do." They might miss the crucial word "Bengal" or the idea of "political dominance." Getting to "puppet nawab" might be too specific without a prompt.

**Competent (20% of class):** 40% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** They will understand the question well and can articulate an answer. They might still make grammatical errors but the core meaning will be there.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They generally recall the key facts: Plassey, British victory, Mir Jafar, control of Bengal. The connection between the victory and the *establishment of political dominance* over Bengal via a puppet ruler is something they've likely been taught and can recall.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Sometimes they might just say "British got Bengal" without fully explaining *how* that contributed to *political dominance* (i.e., through the puppet nawab). Or they might state the nawab was a puppet but forget to mention Bengal directly as the area of control.

**Advanced (10% of class):** 80% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here. They can frame clear and concise answers.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will easily recall the details of Plassey, Mir Jafar's role, and the direct political control established over Bengal. They can connect the dots perfectly to show how this victory initiated the expansion of British political power.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very few, perhaps an oversight in mentioning "Bengal" explicitly if they assume it's understood. They might add extra, but relevant, information beyond the exact scope of the rubric.

**Summary (Total weighted average, not requested but for completeness):**
*   Struggling: 0% * 0.35 = 0%
*   Basic: 5% * 0.35 = 1.75%
*   Competent: 40% * 0.20 = 8%
*   Advanced: 80% * 0.10 = 8%
*   Total Estimated Full Marks for Class: ~17.75%

This breakdown highlights how language proficiency, precise recall of concepts, and the ability to articulate those concepts in a specific manner directly impact scoring, even for a single-point question.
