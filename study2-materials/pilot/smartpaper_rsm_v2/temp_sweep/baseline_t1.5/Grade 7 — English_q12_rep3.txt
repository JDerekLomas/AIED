This is a great question that makes me think deeply about my students and their typical learning curve. Here's my breakdown based on their proficiency levels, keeping in mind the common challenges:

**Struggling (35% of class): 0% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Most struggling students would not understand the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice." Even if I explain "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" in Hindi, the conceptual leap is huge. They'd probably just stare blankly at the sentence.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This task requires both recall (rules of voice change) and reasoning (applying those rules to a new sentence). My struggling students have minimal recall of English grammar rules and very limited reasoning skills in English.
*   **Specific answer:** The answer is very specific. Any deviation (e.g., using the wrong auxiliary verb, wrong past participle) would mean zero marks.
*   **Common mistakes:** If they even tried, they'd likely just repeat the original sentence, change a random word, or perhaps try to make it negative. They wouldn't grasp the concept of voice transformation.

**Basic (35% of class): 5% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** A few in this group might vaguely understand the terms "Active" and "Passive" if I've taught it extensively and used simple Hindi explanations. However, understanding the *transformation* itself is the hurdle. They can read the given sentence, but not necessarily comprehend its structure for transformation.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall *some* components (like adding "by the wind") but often mix up auxiliary verbs or verb forms.
*   **Specific answer:** The precise structure ("were blown away") would be challenging.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   "The leaves *was* blown away by the wind." (Singular/plural error)
    *   "The leaves *is* blown away by the wind." (Wrong tense)
    *   "The leaves *blow* away by the wind." (Incorrect past participle)
    *   "The leaves were *blowed* away by the wind." (Incorrect past participle)
    *   They might even just add "by the wind" to the end of the active sentence without changing anything else.
    *   Only a tiny fraction, perhaps those who rote-learned this specific example or a very similar one, might get it right.

**Competent (20% of class): 50% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They would mostly understand the question and the sentence.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This group generally grasps grammar rules taught in class. They can usually recall the auxiliary verb rules for past simple tense and the need for the past participle.
*   **Specific answer:** They are aiming for the specific structure.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   The biggest error here would likely be using "was" instead of "were" ("The leaves *was* blown away..."). This is a very common slip for them.
    *   Occasionally, they might forget "by the wind" or miss the correct past participle if they're rushing, but usually, they get the core transformation.
    *   Around half would nail it, while the other half might make a minor error like the subject-verb agreement for the auxiliary verb or a very occasional incorrect past participle.

**Advanced (10% of class): 90% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issue here; they are comfortable with English instructions and sentences.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They have a strong grasp of grammar rules and can apply them consistently. They've likely seen and practiced voice transformation many times.
*   **Specific answer:** They know the exact structure required.
*   **Common mistakes:** Very rare, perhaps a truly careless error if they are distracted, but usually they'll get this right. The 10% miss could be for an oversight like omitting "by the wind" or a singular/plural slip, but it's not frequent.

In summary:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 5% full marks
competent: 50% full marks
advanced: 90% full marks
