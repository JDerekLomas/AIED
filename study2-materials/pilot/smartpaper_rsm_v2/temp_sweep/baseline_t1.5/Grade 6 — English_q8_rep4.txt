Here's my estimation based on the student profiles:

*   **struggling: 10% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** Many in this group would struggle with even identifying the individual words, let alone understanding their meaning. Their limited vocabulary and lack of familiarity with basic sentence structures would be major hurdles. They might try to string words together randomly or based on word recognition rather than grammatical understanding. For some, even identifying 'he' as the likely subject might be difficult.

*   **basic: 40% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** Students at this level might recognize common words like 'book' and 'reading'. They might also have a rudimentary understanding of "He is..." as a common starting phrase. However, they often struggle with the exact placement of the verb and object, especially with the continuous tense "is reading". Many might still make errors like "He reading is a book" or "A book he is reading." The concept of SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) might not be fully ingrained for them, requiring some reasoning rather than pure recall.

*   **competent: 80% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** These students generally have a good grasp of basic English sentence structures. They would likely recognize "He is reading a book" as a standard and common sentence. This task would largely be a recall exercise for them, drawing on familiar patterns. Minor mistakes might occur due to carelessness rather than fundamental lack of understanding.

*   **advanced: 100% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** For advanced students, this is a very straightforward task. They would instantly identify the correct sentence structure. It's a foundational concept they would have mastered long ago, requiring minimal effort.
