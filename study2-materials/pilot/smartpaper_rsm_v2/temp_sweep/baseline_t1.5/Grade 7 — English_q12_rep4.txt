This is a very common type of transformation taught in Class 7, but given the specific context of an Indian government school with students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the results would be quite varied.

Here's my estimation, keeping in mind the common difficulties:

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** They often struggle with verb forms, identifying subject/object, and even basic sentence structure. "Blew" to "blown" is a hurdle, and constructing the passive sentence from scratch would be very difficult. Many might just change the word order without changing the voice or verb form.
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks** (These might be students who happened to remember this specific example or have slightly better retention despite being generally "struggling.")

*   **Basic (35% of class):** These students might recall the general rule (object becomes subject, use "be" + past participle), but might falter with irregular verbs or the complete sentence formation. They might get "The leaves were blown away" but forget "by the wind," or use "blowed."
    *   **basic: 30% full marks** (Some will get it right, some will miss "by the wind," some will mess up the verb form. I'm assuming about a third of this group will nail it.)

*   **Competent (20% of class):** These students generally understand grammatical transformations and have a better grasp of verb forms. They're more likely to identify the past tense and apply the correct "were blown."
    *   **competent: 80% full marks** (They might make a silly mistake sometimes, or momentarily forget "by the wind," but generally, they should be able to do this.)

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** For these students, this type of transformation is quite straightforward. They would have a strong command of tenses and irregular verbs.
    *   **advanced: 95% full marks** (They would almost certainly get this right, with a tiny margin for a very rare, inexplicable oversight.)
