Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 6 students from similar backgrounds. This question is about factual recall, which can be tricky even for those who know the answer if the English is difficult.

Here's my assessment:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
* **Language barrier is huge here.** Many would struggle to even read "major mountain ranges located in India" or understand what "ranges" means. They might pick up on "mountain" and "India" but still not grasp the core of the question.
* **Recall is weak.** Even if they understand the question, their general knowledge retention is lower due to various factors (less exposure, focus on survival/daily life over academics outside school, etc.).
* They might remember *one* mountain like "Himalaya" but fail to produce two due to either difficulty recalling a second or not understanding the expectation of "two."

**basic: 40% full marks**
* Many in this group would be able to read and generally understand the question, possibly with some difficulty. They might re-read it a few times or pick up keywords.
* They likely have been taught the Himalayas and maybe one other prominent range (like Aravallis or Vindhyas) in Hindi. The challenge is translating that knowledge into written English.
* Some might write one correctly but struggle with the spelling or recalling a second. They might get 0.5 for one correct, but for *full marks* (which implies two correct), the percentage drops significantly from those who might get partial credit.

**competent: 70% full marks**
* These students are generally more comfortable with English and the content. They've likely internalized the names of at least two major ranges.
* Their recall is stronger, and they are better at associating the English terms with their Hindi equivalents.
* Spelling might still be an issue for some, but they would get the core names correct.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
* These students typically excel in language and content. They would understand the question immediately and recall multiple ranges easily.
* They would confidently write at least two correct names with good spelling.
* The only reason it's not 100% is the slight possibility of an unusual slip of memory or an extremely rare misunderstanding of the question, which is rare for this group.
