This is a very common type of writing prompt in Indian government schools, especially at this level. Let's break down the likely performance.

**My Analysis of the Task:**

*   **Language barriers (many can't read English well):** The prompt itself is relatively simple to read. "My Favourite Hobby," "what it is," "when you do it," "why you enjoy it" are all common phrases. However, formulating the *answer* in English, with correct sentence structure and vocabulary, is the challenge. Many will struggle to translate their thoughts from Hindi to English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This task is primarily recall (recalling *their own* hobby) and simple descriptive writing. It doesn't require complex reasoning or deep analytical skills.
*   **How specific the required answer is:** It's quite specific: 4-5 sentences, hobby, when, why. This helps students structure their answer, but also makes omissions noticeable.
*   **Common mistakes your students make:**
    *   **Sentence fragments:** "Reading books." instead of "My favourite hobby is reading books."
    *   **Simple, repetitive sentences:** "I read. I like it. I am happy."
    *   **Grammar errors:** Tense issues (using present tense for a past action, or vice-versa), subject-verb agreement.
    *   **Lack of conjunctions/connectors:** Difficulty linking ideas smoothly.
    *   **Word choice:** Using basic vocabulary, sometimes incorrect words.
    *   **Completeness:** Missing one of the required elements (e.g., forgets to mention *when* they do it).
    *   **Length:** Writing too few sentences, or writing many short, choppy sentences that don't constitute a "complete paragraph."
    *   **Copying:** Some might try to recall and copy phrases from previous lessons or textbooks, regardless of whether it fits their *actual* hobby.

**Percentage of students scoring full marks (1 point):**

struggling: 0-5% full marks
*They would likely struggle to form coherent sentences in English. They might write 1-2 words, or very fragmented sentences. Even if they identify a hobby, describing *when* and *why* would be beyond them. The concept of a "paragraph" would be hard to execute.*

basic: 10-20% full marks
*They could likely identify a hobby and write a couple of simple sentences about it. Many might struggle to fulfill *all three* criteria (what, when, why) in 4-5 sentences without significant grammar errors. They might write 3 short, grammatically flawed sentences. Completing the full paragraph with all elements would be a stretch for most.*

competent: 60-70% full marks
*Most students in this category would be able to produce a paragraph that hits all the requirements. There might be minor grammatical errors (e.g., article usage, singular/plural), but the meaning would be clear, and the sentences would flow reasonably well. They would understand "paragraph" and aim for the sentence count.*

advanced: 90-100% full marks
*These students would confidently write a complete, grammatically sound paragraph, easily hitting all the criteria within the specified sentence length. They might use a slightly wider vocabulary and show good sentence structure.*
