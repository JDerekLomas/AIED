Let's break this down from the perspective of a Class 6 English teacher in an Indian government school, considering all the factors.

**Analysis of the Item: "There are (some/any) apples in the basket."**

*   **Concept:** This item tests the understanding of 'some' vs. 'any', specifically in affirmative sentences. 'Some' is used for an unspecified quantity in affirmative sentences, while 'any' is typically used in negative sentences and questions.
*   **Language Barriers:**
    *   Reading: Students need to be able to read "There are (some/any) apples in the basket." The words themselves are fairly common, but the context and grammatical nuance are key.
    *   Comprehension: Even if they can read the words, understanding the difference between 'some' and 'any' and applying it correctly is the challenge. Many students translate word-for-word from Hindi, which often doesn't directly map to English grammar rules like this.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires **recall** of a grammatical rule ("'some' in affirmative, 'any' in negative/questions") combined with a bit of **reasoning** to identify the sentence type (affirmative). If they haven't been explicitly taught this rule or haven't practiced it extensively, it's very difficult to guess.
*   **Specificity:** The answer is very specific – only 'some' is correct. There's no partial credit.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Interchangeability: Many students treat 'some' and 'any' as somewhat interchangeable, especially if they don't grasp the subtle distinction in sentence types.
    *   Direct translation from Hindi often leads to errors here as the concepts don't align perfectly.
    *   Guessing: Students who don't know the rule will simply guess one of the two options.

**Percentage of Students Scoring Full Marks:**

*   **struggling: 10% full marks**
    *   Many of these students will struggle to even read the sentence fluently. They likely haven't grasped the basic affirmative/negative sentence structures. Any correct answer would likely be a lucky guess (50% chance between 'some' and 'any'). The 10% accounts for this random chance.
*   **basic: 30% full marks**
    *   These students might recognize the words but the grammatical rule of 'some' vs 'any' is often a tricky spot for them. They might have been introduced to it but haven't internalized it through enough practice. Some might guess correctly, others might recall if it was recently taught, but it's not a solid understanding.
*   **competent: 70% full marks**
    *   These students have a foundational understanding of English grammar. They would likely have been taught this rule and practiced it to some extent. They might pause for a moment to identify it as an affirmative sentence before selecting 'some'. Some might still falter if they get confused with similar rules (e.g., 'much/many').
*   **advanced: 95% full marks**
    *   These students generally have a strong grasp of basic grammar rules. This particular distinction is fundamental. They would quickly identify it as an affirmative sentence requiring 'some' without much hesitation. The 5% accounts for a very rare lapse of concentration or a misreading.
