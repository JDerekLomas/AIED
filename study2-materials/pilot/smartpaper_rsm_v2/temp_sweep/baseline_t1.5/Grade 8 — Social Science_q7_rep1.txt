This is a good question for understanding historical significance, but the full mark requirement is quite specific and relies on accurate recall of a key outcome. Considering the student profile, I expect the percentages to be as follows:

**struggling: 0-5% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Many will struggle to even understand the question properly, especially "contribute to the expansion" and "political dominance."
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** This isn't just a simple recall of "who won." It requires understanding the *consequence* of that victory, which is a step beyond simple memorization for these students.
* **Specificity:** "Political dominance/control over Bengal" and "puppet nawab" are quite specific. Many struggling students might remember "British won" or "British became powerful" but miss the crucial 'how' and 'where'.
* **Common mistakes:** Will likely write something generic like "British became powerful" or "they got control," without specifying Bengal or the "puppet nawab" aspect. Some might confuse it with other battles or general British expansion.

**basic: 10-15% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They might understand the question's gist (Battle of Plassey -> British power), but the nuances of the phrasing might still be challenging.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** Many at this level might remember that Plassey was important for the British becoming strong, but struggle with articulating the *mechanism* (puppet nawab, political control).
* **Specificity:** They might say "British controlled Bengal" which is close, but may miss the "puppet nawab" detail needed for the *how* of political dominance, which is crucial for a full score.
* **Common mistakes:** Often give partially correct answers like "British got control of Bengal" or "Mir Jafar helped the British," but might not connect it strongly enough to "political dominance" or explicitly mention him as a puppet.

**competent: 50-60% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They should be able to read and understand the question clearly.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would have been taught the significance of Plassey in detail, including Mir Jafar's role and the political implications for Bengal.
* **Specificity:** Many at this level would likely remember the key details: British victory led to control over Bengal by making Mir Jafar the puppet nawab. They can connect the dots.
* **Common mistakes:** A few might forget to mention Mir Jafar as a "puppet" and simply say "British took control of Bengal," which is almost there but might slightly miss the nuance for a perfect score.

**advanced: 85-95% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issue here.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** These students often have a strong grasp of historical concepts and can recall specific details and their significance. They would have internalized the impact of Plassey.
* **Specificity:** They would articulate precisely that the British victory at Plassey led to the establishment of direct or indirect political control over Bengal by installing Mir Jafar as a puppet ruler.
* **Common mistakes:** Very few mistakes, perhaps a minor omission in phrasing, but the core concept would be accurately conveyed.
