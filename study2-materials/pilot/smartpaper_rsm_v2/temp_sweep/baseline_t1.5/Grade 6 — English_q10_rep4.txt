Okay, let's break this down from the perspective of teaching Class 6 English in a government school in India, considering the student demographics and proficiency levels.

**Analysis of the Item:**

*   **Language barriers:** "There are... apples in the basket." This sentence structure is relatively common, but "some" vs. "any" is a tricky grammatical point. Students often default to what sounds 'right' or what they've heard more frequently.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires recall of a grammatical rule (using 'some' in affirmative sentences for uncountable/plural nouns, and 'any' in negative or interrogative sentences). While there's a reasoning component (identifying it's an affirmative sentence), the core is memorized usage.
*   **Specificity:** The answer is very specific. Only 'some' is correct.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Using 'any' in affirmative sentences because they hear it in questions often.
    *   Not understanding the concept of affirmative/negative sentences clearly.
    *   Simply guessing because they don't know the rule.
    *   Struggling to read the options 'some' and 'any' correctly.
    *   Lack of exposure to this specific grammar point being explicitly taught or reinforced.

Given these points, here's my assessment:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 25% full marks
competent: 70% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
