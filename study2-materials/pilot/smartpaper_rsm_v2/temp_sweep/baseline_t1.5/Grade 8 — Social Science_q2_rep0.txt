Okay, as a Class 8 Social Science teacher in an Indian government school, I'd approach this question with a keen understanding of my students' backgrounds and learning levels.

First, let's break down the question and the rubric: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning." The rubric is quite straightforward, looking for recall of a specific factual detail.

Here's my estimation for each group:

**Struggling (35% of class): 0-5% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they have a vague idea, articulating it in English, even a simple sentence, will be very difficult. Words like "urban planning," "civilization," "feature," and "Harappan" themselves might be hard to process.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is purely recall. They might confuse Harappa with other historical periods or just draw a blank.
*   **Specificity:** They might say something general like "it was a good city" or "people lived there," which wouldn't get a mark.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Misspelling, irrelevant answers, no answer, or answering in Hindi without permission (which wouldn't score full marks if English is required).

**Basic (35% of class): 20-30% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They can usually read and understand simpler English sentences. "Harappan Civilization" and "urban planning" would likely register. They might struggle to *form* a perfectly grammatically correct English sentence but could manage something basic.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Many will remember key terms discussed in class, like "drainage system" or "baked bricks."
*   **Specificity:** They might provide one of the listed points, perhaps in a slightly broken English sentence: "They had good drainage" or "Houses made with pakki bricks." This would likely get them the mark.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Minor grammatical errors, not elaborating enough (but for 1 mark, this might still be okay), or recalling a correct feature but explaining it vaguely. They might recall *a* feature, but perhaps not one directly related to *urban planning* if we've covered other aspects.

**Competent (20% of class): 70-80% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They will generally understand the question well and be able to articulate their answer clearly in English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Strong recall. They've likely paid attention in class and understand the distinct features.
*   **Specificity:** They can easily pinpoint and describe one key feature accurately, like "The city was divided into a citadel and a lower town," or "They had a sophisticated drainage system with covered drains."
*   **Common Mistakes:** Perhaps not elaborating as much as they *could*, but certainly enough for a full mark. A very rare recall error, but generally strong performance.

**Advanced (10% of class): 95-100% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here. They will understand the nuances of the question and provide a well-structured answer.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Excellent recall and understanding of the topic.
*   **Specificity:** They will provide a clear, accurate, and concise answer, possibly using slightly more descriptive vocabulary. "The Harappan cities featured an exemplary grid pattern of streets, cutting each other at right angles, demonstrating advanced urban planning."
*   **Common Mistakes:** Virtually none for a 1-mark question like this. If they made a mistake, it would be a rare lapse in attention or an isolated recall error.
