This is a good, practical question for Class 7 students. As their teacher, I've seen similar questions in their exams and class activities.

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 30% full marks
competent: 75% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks

**My thought process behind these percentages:**

*   **Understanding the Prompt:** The prompt is clear: "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." This is a straightforward writing task requiring personal expression.

*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This task primarily requires *recall* of vocabulary related to hobbies and personal experiences, combined with basic *reasoning* for "why I enjoy it." It doesn't involve complex critical thinking or abstract reasoning, which is a good thing for students with limited proficiency.

*   **Language Barriers & Reading Comprehension:**
    *   **Struggling students (35%):** Many in this group would struggle just to *read and understand* the prompt correctly. "Paragraph," "favourite," "hobby," "mention," "enjoy" – these words might be unfamiliar or confusing. They might write isolated sentences, list items, or write something completely off-topic due to misinterpreting the core task. Even if they know what a hobby is, constructing a coherent *paragraph* of 4-5 sentences, while hitting all three required points, is a huge challenge. They might write "My hobby is playing" but not elaborate or explain why.
    *   **Basic students (35%):** They can generally read and understand the prompt. They might grasp the concept of a paragraph. Their main hurdle will be *sentence structure, vocabulary, and cohesion*. They might write simple sentences like "My hobby is cricket. I play everyday. I like it because it is fun." but struggle to expand it into 4-5 *well-connected* sentences and explicitly state *when* they do it beyond "everyday." They might miss one of the three required components or struggle to make it a natural flow.
    *   **Competent students (20%):** This group can usually tackle all three points. They have better vocabulary and can construct more complex sentences. They might write "My favourite hobby is reading storybooks. I usually read after school, before dinner. I enjoy reading because it takes me to new places and teaches me new things." They might make minor grammatical errors but would fulfil the criteria.
    *   **Advanced students (10%):** They will likely ace this. They have good vocabulary, sentence structure, and can naturally fulfil all requirements while potentially adding a bit more detail or flair. Their paragraphs would be well-formed and grammatically sound.

*   **Specificity of Required Answer:** The requirements (what, when, why) are specific but allow for personal answers, which can be easier for students than analytical tasks. However, ensuring all three are present and *clearly stated* within 4-5 sentences is the key.

*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Not writing a paragraph (e.g., just bullet points or isolated sentences).
    *   Writing fewer than 4 or more than 5 sentences.
    *   Missing one of the three components (e.g., forgetting to say *when* they do it, or *why* they enjoy it).
    *   Using very simplistic language that doesn't fully explain (e.g., "I like it. It is good.")
    *   Grammar and spelling errors, which might distract but might not lose a "full marks" if the core task is completed. (Assuming the scoring rubric is primarily focused on content completeness and paragraph structure.)

Considering these factors, particularly the varying proficiency levels in reading comprehension, vocabulary, and sentence construction, the percentages reflect the realistic output I'd expect. The jump from "struggling" to "basic" is significant because basic students can at least decipher the task, even if their execution is limited.
