Here's my assessment based on my experience:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
* **Reasoning:** The concept of negative numbers, especially as a solution, is a major hurdle. Many would try to rearrange it as `y = 9 - 4 = 5`, or simply struggle with the idea that adding 9 could result in a smaller number. The English instruction further complicates understanding for them, even if the numbers are simple. Many might get stuck after moving the 9 to the other side due to calculation errors.

**basic:** 30% full marks
* **Reasoning:** Students at this level generally understand basic algebraic manipulation of moving terms. However, the `4 - 9` step often trips them up. They might understand `9 - 4 = 5` but not be comfortable with `4 - 9` leading to a negative result. There will be a significant portion who will either make a sign error or write `5` instead of `-5`. Some might attempt to solve it by thinking "what plus 9 gives 4?" but still struggle with the negative aspect.

**competent:** 75% full marks
* **Reasoning:** These students generally have a good grasp of basic integers and algebraic manipulation. They would likely understand that moving the 9 to the other side means subtracting it, and they are usually comfortable with subtracting a larger number from a smaller one to get a negative result. The English is less of a barrier here. A few might still make a careless calculation or sign error, but the concept is understood.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
* **Reasoning:** These students are usually quick and accurate with integer operations and algebraic steps. They would see `y = 4 - 9` and instantly arrive at `-5`. The language is not an issue, and they are unlikely to make computational or sign errors. The remaining 5% could be due to a rare moment of distraction or a very silly mistake, but it's highly improbable.
