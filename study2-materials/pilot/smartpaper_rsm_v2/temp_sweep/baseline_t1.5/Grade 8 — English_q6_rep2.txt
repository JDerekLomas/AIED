Here's my estimation based on the student profile and the task:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
* **Reasoning:** These students struggle with basic English comprehension and vocabulary. Defining "fable" with specific terms like "imparts a moral lesson" or even "typically uses animals as characters" would be beyond their current capacity, especially if they haven't explicitly been taught this definition in an accessible way. They might grasp the concept of "story with animals" but linking it to a "moral" is often the difficult part for them. They'd likely just write "a story" or nothing.

**basic:** 10% full marks
* **Reasoning:** These students have a basic grasp of English, but recall of a precise definition like this is challenging. They might remember one or two key elements (like "animals" or "story") but combining them into a comprehensive answer including "moral lesson" would be difficult. If we've extensively worked on fables and their characteristics, a small percentage might get it, but many would miss "moral" or use simpler, less precise language. They might define it as "a story with animals" but omit the "moral lesson" part, or define it as "a story that teaches something" but omit "animals."

**competent:** 50% full marks
* **Reasoning:** These students can usually understand and reproduce information they've been taught. If we've specifically discussed and defined fables in class, a good chunk of them would be able to recall the key elements. They might not use perfect grammatical sentences but would likely include "short story," "animals," and "moral lesson." They are good at remembering definitions and can form simple sentences to express them. However, some might still forget one of the elements, or express it less clearly than required for full marks.

**advanced:** 80% full marks
* **Reasoning:** These students generally have good comprehension and recall. If fables have been covered in class, they would most likely remember the key definition. They can read and understand the prompt well and have a broader vocabulary. The most common mistake might be slightly imprecise wording rather than a complete omission of a key element. They are usually able to combine the different components of the definition accurately.
