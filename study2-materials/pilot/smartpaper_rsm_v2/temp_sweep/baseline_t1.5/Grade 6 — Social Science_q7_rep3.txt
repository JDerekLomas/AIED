Namaste, bachcho! Aayiye, aaj hum Rajasthan ke prakritik sansadhanon ke baare mein baat karte hain.

**Struggling Students (35%)**
For these students, the biggest hurdle will be understanding the question itself. The English will be a significant barrier. Even if they know some resources, expressing it in English and then explaining the influence will be very difficult. They might just list one or two words they vaguely remember, like "paani" or "ret" (water, sand), without linking them properly to the question's requirement. They often mix up concepts or can't articulate them.

**Basic Students (35%)**
These students might grasp parts of the question if I read it out and explain the meaning of "natural resources" (prakritik sansadhan) and "influence" (prabhav) in Hindi. They might be able to recall two resources like 'pani' (water) and 'marbal' (marble). Some might even attempt to explain the influence of water, possibly mentioning farming or drinking, but the explanation might be very rudimentary, incomplete, or grammatically incorrect in English. They'll struggle with structured answers.

**Competent Students (20%)**
These students have a better grasp of English and the concepts. They would likely identify two resources correctly (e.g., water, marble, solar energy, copper). They would also be able to explain the influence of one of them in a reasonable manner, perhaps mentioning how water scarcity impacts agriculture, daily life, or how solar energy is being used. Their explanations might still lack detail or sophistication but will be understandable and address the core of the question.

**Advanced Students (10%)**
These students generally understand the question well, despite the language. They would not only recall two accurate resources (e.g., Water, Solar energy, Marble, Zinc) but would also articulate the influence of one in a coherent and grammatically acceptable way. For example, they might explain how water scarcity leads to specific agricultural practices, animal husbandry, or even migration patterns, or how solar energy is transforming rural lives. They are better at structuring their answers and providing relevant details.
