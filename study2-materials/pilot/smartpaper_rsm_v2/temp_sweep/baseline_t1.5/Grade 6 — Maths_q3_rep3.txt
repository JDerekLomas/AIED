This is a good question that really makes me think about my students!

Here's my breakdown:

*   **Language barriers:** The numbers are universal, but the instruction "Arrange in ascending order" is critical. Many of my Hindi-medium students would struggle to understand "ascending order" even if they could recognize the numbers. I'd likely need to teach them what "ascending" means using examples (like climbing stairs, "chote se bada") before giving them such a problem.

*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires reasoning – comparing multi-digit numbers. It's not a recall of facts. They need to understand place value (thousands, hundreds, tens, units) to effectively compare.

*   **Specific answer:** The answer is very specific – only one correct order.

*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Misunderstanding "ascending" (some might do descending).
    *   Focusing only on the first digit and making errors (e.g., seeing '7' in 736 and '3' in 3367, not realizing 736 is only three digits long while others are four).
    *   Errors in comparing numbers with different numbers of digits (736 vs 3367). This is a very common one – they see "3" and "7" and automatically assume the one with "7" is larger if they don't count digits.

Considering all this, especially the language barrier with "ascending order" and the comparison of numbers with different digit counts (736 is only 3 digits), I anticipate scores to be lower for the struggling and basic groups, but still a good percentage for the advanced students.

Here's my estimation:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 25% full marks
competent: 70% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
