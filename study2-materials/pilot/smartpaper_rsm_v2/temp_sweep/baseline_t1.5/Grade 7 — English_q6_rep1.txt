This is a challenging question for many students, especially given their background and the general English proficiency levels.

Here's my breakdown:

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** These students often cannot even read the question properly, let alone understand "poet's writing style." They might just guess a random English word if they are forced to write something. Many would leave it blank.
    *   **struggling: 0% full marks**

*   **Basic (35% of class):** These students might understand "poet" and "writing," but "style" would be a difficult concept for them in English, especially when applied to literature. They might think of "good writing" or "bad writing." Even if they have read the poem, articulating a specific style might be beyond their current vocabulary and comprehension. They might offer a very general observation like "the poet writes about nature" which doesn't address "style."
    *   **basic: 5% full marks** (This 5% would be the stronger end of the "basic" group who might have some grasp of "simple" or "descriptive" if it was heavily emphasized during teaching).

*   **Competent (20% of class):** These students have a decent chance. They can read and comprehend the question. If they've been taught to look for specific characteristics in a poem (e.g., does it use lots of imagery? Is it easy to understand?), and have been given appropriate vocabulary (like "simple," "descriptive," "lively," "direct"), they would be able to apply it. The key here is prior instruction and practice. If the poem itself lends itself to an easily identifiable style, their chances improve significantly.
    *   **competent: 50% full marks** (This accounts for some who might still struggle with the abstract concept or appropriate vocabulary, even if they understand the poem).

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** These students are more likely to grasp the abstract concept of "writing style." They probably have a broader vocabulary and better analytical skills. They would likely be able to pick out an appropriate word like "descriptive," "narrative," "simple," or "evocative" based on the poem, even without explicit prior instruction on *that specific* poem's style.
    *   **advanced: 80% full marks** (Even here, there might be 20% who get stuck on finding *the most appropriate* single word or get bogged down trying to think too complexly).

**Summary:**

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 5% full marks
competent: 50% full marks
advanced: 80% full marks
