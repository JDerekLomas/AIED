Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 6 students in a government school, keeping in mind the specific demographics and ability levels.

The sentence "He is reading a book" follows a very common SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure, which we often drill. However, the *reading* part is the biggest hurdle for many.

*   **Language barriers (many can't read English well):** This is the immediate first filter. If a student cannot recognize "book," "reading," "is," "he," and "a," they cannot even begin to rearrange them. Many struggling students will stumble here. They might know the *sound* of some words but not the written form well enough to manipulate them.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** For the struggling and basic levels, it's more recall of patterns and very basic word recognition. For competent and advanced, it involves reasoning about sentence structure. The required answer is very specific.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Incomplete sentences:** "He reading a book." (missing 'is')
    *   **Incorrect word order (especially verb placement):** "He book reading is a." or "Reading he is a book."
    *   **Capitalization:** Not starting with 'He' capitalized. (Though my focus for this question's *meaningful sentence* would be word order first).
    *   **Not understanding the words:** Simply putting words randomly because they don't know what they mean.

Here's my assessment:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 30% full marks
competent: 80% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
