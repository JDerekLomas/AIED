Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 7 English students in a government school, keeping in mind the demographics and specific challenges.

The sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is a past simple active voice sentence. Converting it to passive voice requires understanding past tense of "be" verb, past participle of "blow," and the concept of subject/object interchange.

Here's my estimation:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Many might not even fully comprehend the original sentence. "Blew" and "away" might be tricky.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires reasoning about voice change rules, not just recall of vocabulary. They often lack the foundational grammatical understanding.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might try to change "wind" or "leaves" into another word, keep the sentence active but change a word, or simply write gibberish. They wouldn't know "were blown."

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Some might understand the basic meaning of the sentence.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might have *seen* passive voice examples but often struggle to apply the rules consistently. They'd likely get the "by the wind" part right but might struggle with "were blown."
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   "The leaves *was* blown away by the wind." (Subject-verb agreement error with 'was' instead of 'were')
    *   "The leaves *are* blown away by the wind." (Tense change error)
    *   "The leaves blown away by the wind." (Missing the 'to be' verb entirely)
    *   "The leaves *were blew* away by the wind." (Incorrect past participle)
    *   They might even correctly identify "leaves" as the new subject and "by the wind" but miss the verb transformation entirely.
    *   A small percentage, perhaps those who recently revised it and have decent rote learning ability, might manage.

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They would understand the sentence fully.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They have been taught voice change and generally grasp the concept. They know to switch subject and object and use 'by'. The main challenge will be accurately identifying the correct form of the 'to be' verb and the past participle.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   The most common mistake would be "The leaves *was* blown away by the wind" (still a persistent error for some, even at this level, particularly with plural subjects when thinking quickly).
    *   Slight confusion with the past participle form: "The leaves *were blowed* away by the wind." (though less common than the 'was/were' error).
    *   They might miss "by the wind" if they're rushing or not entirely focused on including the agent.
    *   Many would get it right because they've practiced it sufficiently.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issue.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They understand the grammatical rules thoroughly and can apply them with ease. They would instantly identify "blew" as simple past and know to use "were" + past participle "blown."
*   **Common Mistakes:** Extremely rare for this group. Perhaps a very momentary lapse of concentration leading to a 'was' instead of 'were', but they would usually self-correct. They have a strong command over grammar and tenses.
