Okay, let's break this down from the perspective of teaching Class 8 Social Science in a government school, keeping my students' profiles in mind.

The question is quite direct: "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

The scoring rubric is specific: "explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."

**Analysis:**

1.  **Language Barriers:** This is a major hurdle. "Contribute to the expansion of British power" and "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal" are academic phrases. Many students will struggle to fully comprehend the question, let alone formulate an answer using such vocabulary, even if they grasp the core concept in Hindi. They might identify Plassey as a British victory but connecting it explicitly to "political dominance" over *Bengal* and explaining *how* (Mir Jafar) is where the language becomes an impediment for those less proficient.

2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is primarily a recall question, but it requires a specific level of detail in that recall. They need to recall not just *that* Plassey was a British victory, but its *consequence* in terms of political control *over Bengal* and the *mechanism* (puppet nawab). Simply stating "British won" or "British became powerful" wouldn't be enough for the full mark.

3.  **Specificity of the required answer:** The rubric is very specific. "Political dominance/control over Bengal" and "placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab" are key phrases. Many students might vaguely say "British power increased" or "British gained control," but without the Bengal specificity or the puppet nawab detail, they might miss the full mark.

4.  **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Vague answers:** "British became stronger." "British got control."
    *   **Misremembering details:** Mixing up Mir Jafar with someone else, or not recalling the "puppet" aspect.
    *   **Focusing on economic gains (like revenue rights) instead of political control:** While Plassey *led* to these, the direct impact on political control over Bengal is what's asked.
    *   **Inability to translate understanding into written English:** A student might conceptually know it in Hindi but struggle to write it accurately and fully in English.
    *   **Simply stating "British won the battle."** This answers "what happened?" not "how did it contribute to expansion?"

**Percentage Predictions for Full Marks (based on my experience):**

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** These students often struggle to read and understand the question itself in English. They might know "Plassey, British, win" from general class discussion in Hindi, but articulating the *political dominance over Bengal* and *Mir Jafar* will be beyond them. Even if they get one word right, it will likely be too vague.
    *   **0% full marks.** (Maybe 5-10% might get partial credit for "British got control" but not the full specific answer.)

*   **Basic (35% of class):** These students can usually read the question with some effort. They will recall that the British won Plassey. They might even remember that British power increased. Some might vaguely recall Mir Jafar. However, putting together "political dominance/control over *Bengal*" and the "puppet nawab" detail comprehensively in English for a full mark is still a stretch for many. They might say "British controlled Bengal" but miss the "political dominance" nuance or the "puppet nawab" explanation of *how*.
    *   **5% full marks.** (A few might get it perfectly, but most will be just short due to specificity or language.)

*   **Competent (20% of class):** These students generally understand the question well. They would have paid attention to the nuances during class discussions (likely conducted in Hinglish for such topics). They understand the concept of a "puppet ruler." They are more likely to articulate the key elements in a reasonably clear way, even if the English isn't perfect. The connection to "Bengal" and "puppet nawab" would be a stronger recall for them.
    *   **50% full marks.** (The other 50% might be slightly less specific or have minor language issues that slightly dilute the answer for a full mark, but they'd be close.)

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** These students grasp concepts quickly and can usually express themselves reasonably well in English. They will have no problem recalling the specific details (political dominance, Bengal, Mir Jafar as puppet) and framing it appropriately in English to
