This is a very insightful question that really hits at the heart of the challenges we face in government schools. Here's my breakdown based on experience with Class 6 English students with the described profile:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 5% full marks
competent: 60% full marks
advanced: 90% full marks

Let me elaborate on my reasoning:

**Why the Low Scores for Struggling and Basic:**

*   **Language Barrier (Reading Comprehension):** The biggest hurdle. Many struggling students will not be able to read the poem independently, let alone understand its meaning. They might recognize a few words but stitching them together for comprehension is very difficult. Even if I've read it aloud multiple times, their recall of specific lines and understanding of nuance will be minimal.
*   **Vocabulary:** Even basic-level students will struggle with the vocabulary in many poems. They might grasp the general theme with a lot of scaffolding, but pinpointing a specific *line* they like requires deeper engagement with the words.
*   **Abstract Reasoning/Personal Preference:** The question "Which line do you like the most and why?" requires them to not just understand the poem but also to form a personal connection and articulate it. For many students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are primarily focused on literal meaning and rote learning due to a lack of exposure, this is a very abstract concept. They are often not encouraged to express personal opinions in academic settings, especially not in English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question heavily relies on both recall *and* reasoning. They need to recall lines from the poem, choose one, and then *reason* why they like it. For struggling students, simply recalling *any* line correctly in English is a challenge. For basic students, recalling a line might be possible if it's very prominent or oft-repeated, but the "why" will stump most of them. They might resort to very generic answers like "It is good" or "I like it."
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Writing "I like the poem." (Not a line)
    *   Writing a phrase that isn't a complete line or misquoting a line.
    *   Not giving a reason, or giving a very vague reason ("because it is good").
    *   Copying a full stanza instead of a line, indicating they haven't grasped the concept of a "line."
    *   Struggling to articulate their reason in English. They might know *why* in Hindi but cannot translate it effectively.
    *   Remaining silent or writing nothing at all out of fear of making a mistake.

**Why Higher Scores for Competent and Advanced:**

*   **Reading and Comprehension:** Competent students can usually read the poem with some assistance, and with prior classroom discussion, can understand the gist. Advanced students can read and understand independently.
*   **Vocabulary:** They will have a better grasp of the vocabulary, making it easier to connect with the meaning of specific lines.
*   **Abstract Thinking:** These students are more capable of forming personal opinions and articulating them, especially the advanced group. They are more likely to have some exposure to expressing themselves.
*   **Language Production:** They have the English proficiency to identify a line and then formulate a simple sentence or two to explain their preference.
*   **Common Mistakes (Competent):** May choose a less compelling reason or struggle to phrase it eloquently. Might paraphrase the line instead of quoting directly.
*   **Common Mistakes (Advanced):** Very few, usually minor grammatical errors, or sometimes they might pick a very profound line but struggle to articulate their "why" in simple English that shows their full understanding.

**In my classroom, to help all students, I would heavily scaffold this question:**

1.  **Read Aloud Multiple Times:** With actions and voice modulation.
2.  **Line-by-Line Explanation (in Hindi and English):** For comprehension.
3.  **Visuals:** If applicable, to support understanding.
4.  **Discussion:** Ask "What does this line mean?" and "Do you like this part?" (in Hindi first).
5.  **Model Answers:** "I like the line 'The sun is shining bright' because it makes me feel happy." (Simplest example)
6.  **Sentence Starters:** "I like the line '...' because it makes me feel..." or "I like the line '...' because..."
7.  **Group Work:** Allow struggling and basic students to discuss in small groups (often in Hindi) and then try to frame an English answer together.

Even with all this scaffolding, the requirement to "denote a line from the poem *and* mention why" in English means that struggling and many basic students would struggle to hit both components independently. They might get one
