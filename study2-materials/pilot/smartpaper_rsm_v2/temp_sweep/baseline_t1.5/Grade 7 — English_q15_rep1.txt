This is a common and relatively straightforward writing prompt for Class 7, focusing on personal expression rather than complex academic topics. However, given the specific context of an Indian government school with a diverse range of English proficiency, the distribution of full marks will vary significantly across the ability groups.

Here's my assessment:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 25% full marks
competent: 80% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**

*   **Struggling (35% of students):**
    *   **Language barriers:** Many would struggle to *read* and fully comprehend the prompt itself, let alone formulate a grammatically correct 4-5 sentence paragraph.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This task requires recalling personal information and then framing it into complete sentences, which can be challenging for those with very limited vocabulary and sentence structure knowledge. They might just list the hobby without elaboration.
    *   **Common mistakes:**
        *   Single-word answers or very short, broken sentences.
        *   Incorrect verb tenses ("I like to drawing").
        *   Absence of a complete paragraph structure.
        *   Missing one or more of the required elements (when/why).
        *   Grammatical errors making sentences incomprehensible.
        *   Copying phrases from elsewhere (if given example).
    *   **Why 5%?** A very small percentage, likely those on the cusp of the "basic" group or those who have had some external support/exposure, might manage a barely acceptable paragraph with significant errors but fulfilling all requirements.

*   **Basic (35% of students):**
    *   **Language barriers:** They can usually understand the prompt, but forming coherent sentences and maintaining flow is difficult.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall their hobby, but articulating *why* they enjoy it in appropriate English might lead to repetitive or simplistic statements.
    *   **Common mistakes:**
        *   Short, choppy sentences that don't flow well.
        *   Grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, articles, prepositions).
        *   Paragraph might be too short (2-3 sentences) or just hit the minimum.
        *   Vague explanations for "why."
        *   Mixing Hindi words when they struggle to find the English equivalent.
    *   **Why 25%?** Many will attempt all parts, but their execution will likely contain enough errors or be slightly under the 4-5 sentence count to miss full marks. Those who score full marks will have managed to string together enough simple sentences to address all parts, even if the language is basic.

*   **Competent (20% of students):**
    *   **Language barriers:** Generally able to read, understand, and formulate their thoughts.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This task is well within their capacity. They can express their thoughts clearly.
    *   **Common mistakes:**
        *   Minor grammatical errors (e.g., article usage, less common prepositions).
        *   Sentence structure might be a bit repetitive but generally correct.
        *   Could sometimes write a paragraph that's slightly too short (e.g., 3 strong sentences).
    *   **Why 80%?** Most in this group would comfortably meet all criteria. The 20% who don't might make a couple of significant grammatical errors, or struggle slightly with explaining the "why" in a nuanced way, or perhaps write a paragraph that's only 3 sentences instead of 4-5.

*   **Advanced (10% of students):**
    *   **Language barriers:** Minimal to no barriers for this task.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can articulate their thoughts fluently and creatively.
    *   **Common mistakes:** Very rare, perhaps a slip of pen or a very minor error.
    *   **Why 95%?** This task is straightforward for them. They would likely write a well-structured paragraph with good vocabulary and sentence variation, clearly addressing all parts of the prompt. The 5% who miss out might do so due to oversight (e.g., forgetting to mention *when*) rather than inability, or making a very rare careless error.
