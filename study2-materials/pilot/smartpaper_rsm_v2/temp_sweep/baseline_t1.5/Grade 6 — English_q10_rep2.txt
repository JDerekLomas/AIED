Okay, looking at that question, "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket," and thinking about my Class 6 students with their diverse backgrounds and proficiency levels, here's my breakdown:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Many wouldn't even properly grasp the meaning of "choose the correct word" or "basket." "Apples" they might recognize from pictures. "Some" and "any" are abstract quantifiers.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires recall of a grammar rule about positive sentences and 'some' or 'any,' which is a higher-level abstract concept. They're more at a stage of recognizing basic vocabulary.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might pick one randomly, or be completely blank. If they try to translate, it would be difficult to connect.

**basic:** 25% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They might understand the gist of "There are apples in the basket." "Some" and "any" might be words they've heard or seen, but perhaps not fully understood in their grammatical context.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This *does* require recall of the rule, but some might have encountered it during a lesson and retained it, or perhaps use it intuitively in simpler contexts. However, the rule itself ("some" for positive statements, "any" for questions/negatives) is often confusing even for basic learners.
*   **Common Mistakes:** A common mistake here would be to guess between the two, or maybe confuse it with a question format if they are just picking up on 'any' in general. They might understand "some" means 'kuchh' (some) and "any" means 'koii bhii' (any/even one), but applying it correctly in this positive sentence is the challenge.

**competent:** 75% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They would understand the sentence and the task clearly.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** These students would likely have been explicitly taught the rule for 'some' and 'any' and have had some practice. They can recall the rule and apply it with reasonable accuracy in a straightforward positive sentence like this one.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Occasional slips might happen, especially if they are thinking too fast, but the concept is within their grasp.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** No issues here.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would not only recall the rule instantly but also understand *why* 'some' is correct (positive statement). They would have solidified this concept and be able to apply it confidently.
*   **Common Mistakes:** A very rare slip of attention is possible, but highly unlikely for this straightforward application.
