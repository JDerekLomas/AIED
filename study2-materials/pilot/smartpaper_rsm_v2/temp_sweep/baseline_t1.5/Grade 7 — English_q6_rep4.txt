This is a challenging question for most of my students, especially given the context of a Class 7 English student from an economically weaker section and a Hindi-medium background. Here's my breakdown:

**Struggling (35%): 0% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** Many would not understand "writing style" or "describes" properly. They might not even recognize a 'suitable and relevant word' even if they read one.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires a degree of analytical reasoning about text, which is beyond their current proficiency. They struggle with basic comprehension, let alone analysis.
* **Common mistakes:** They might just pick a random word from the poem, or misunderstand the question entirely and try to summarize the poem's content.

**Basic (35%): 5% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** Some might vaguely understand "writing style" with prompting or if it's been explicitly taught very recently and repeated often. They might be able to identify a *very* simple word if they understand the question's intent.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They'd need to have been *explicitly taught* about different writing styles and given very specific examples for a particular poet. Without direct teaching and strong memory, they'd struggle to deduce it.
* **Common mistakes:** They might use a word describing the *topic* of the poem (e.g., "sad" if the poem is sad) rather than the *style*. They might give a descriptive phrase instead of a single word. They might write "good" or "nice."

**Competent (20%): 40% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** They would largely understand "writing style" and "describes."
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They have a better chance of reasoning it out, especially if the poet's style is indeed "simple" or "descriptive." If the poem is in the textbook and this concept of 'writing style' has been introduced and practiced in class, they could manage.
* **Common mistakes:** Some might still lean towards content-related words rather than style-related ones. Some might give a slightly less precise but still acceptable word.

**Advanced (10%): 80% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** No issues here. They understand the vocabulary and the question's demand.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They are more capable of abstract thinking and analysis. They can infer a suitable word like "simple," "descriptive," "narrative," "informal," or "direct" from the text itself, even if it hasn't been explicitly taught for *that specific poem*. They can connect their general knowledge of literary terms to the specific text.
* **Common mistakes:** They might choose a more nuanced word that, while accurate, might not be one of the "expected" simple answers, but would still count if justified. A small percentage might overthink it or struggle if the style is particularly complex for Class 7.
