Here's my breakdown based on experience:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
Even if the numbers were simple, the language barrier alone is a huge hurdle. "Temperature increases by 2 degrees C per hour" - many won't grasp the "per hour" concept clearly in English, or even what "increases" means in this context. The multiple steps (finding time elapsed, then multiplying) would be beyond most in this group. They might pick out numbers and try to add/subtract randomly.

**basic: 10% full marks**
This group might understand "temperature at 10 am was 30C". The "increases by 2C per hour" part, while challenging due to language, *might* be understood by some if simplified verbally or if they can pick out the numbers. The biggest obstacle is calculating the time elapsed from 10 am to 4 pm accurately. They are very prone to errors like 4 - 10 = -6, or just counting 4 hours, or struggling with the AM/PM transition. If they correctly calculate time elapsed, then 6 hours * 2C is still an extra step. Even if they get the hours, the multiplication could be a simple error. Many would guess or try simple additions/subtractions.

**competent: 50% full marks**
This group has a better chance with the English, especially key words like "increases" and "per hour." The main challenge for them would be calculating the time elapsed (10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours). Some might still make a small mistake here (e.g., thinking 5 hours). If they get the hours right, then 6 * 2 = 12, and 30 + 12 = 42 is generally within their grasp. However, a significant portion might still stumble on the time calculation or make an arithmetic error.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
These students would generally be able to read and understand the problem statement. Calculating 10 am to 4 pm (6 hours) is a common reasoning skill they've developed. Multiplying 6 by 2 and then adding to 30 is straightforward for them. The language is not a significant barrier here. The 10% who might miss full marks would be due to a careless calculation error rather than a conceptual misunderstanding or language issue. They might misread a number or make a small addition error.
