This is a classic recall question for Class 8, focusing on a specific fact from a historical period. Given the context, here's my breakdown:

**Harappan Civilization's Urban Planning Feature:**
This is a standard topic covered in NCERT Social Science textbooks for Class 6/7, and reinforced in Class 8. The features are usually presented quite directly.

*   **Language barriers:** "Key feature," "urban planning," "Harappan Civilization" – these are technical terms. Even if taught in Hindi, translating them mentally can be an issue. Students might understand "Harappan sabhyata ki shehri yojna ka ek mukhya pehlu."
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** Pure recall. Students either know it or they don't.
*   **Specificity:** The rubric is quite generous ("well-planned grid layout," "advanced drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel and lower town"). This broadens the chances of getting it right if they remember *any* specific detail.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Not understanding "urban planning":** They might recall *general* features of the civilization rather than specifically about its city layout.
    *   **Lack of precise vocabulary:** They might remember the concept but struggle to articulate it using appropriate English terms (e.g., they know there were good drains but can't say "advanced drainage system").
    *   **Partial recall:** Remembering "good streets" instead of "grid pattern."
    *   **Hindi recall, English struggle:** Knowing the answer in Hindi perfectly but failing to write it adequately in English.

**Percentage of students scoring full marks:**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   They likely have significant language comprehension issues. Even if they heard it in class, translating and recalling in English is very hard.
    *   They struggle with basic concepts and retention.
    *   *My estimate: 5% full marks* (These might be the ones who rote-learned a specific sentence, or who are generally a bit better than the 'struggling' label suggests and have a surprising grasp).

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   They might understand the question after some thought or cues.
    *   They could recall one of the features in a simplified manner, like "they had good drains" or "their streets were straight." The rubric allows for this.
    *   Language will still be a hurdle for precise articulation.
    *   *My estimate: 30% full marks* (Many will get it, but many will also lose marks due to vague answers or struggle with English).

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   They should comfortably understand the question.
    *   They will have a clear recall of at least one key feature and be able to articulate it reasonably well in English.
    *   *My estimate: 80% full marks* (The majority will score, some might falter on precise vocabulary or minor details).

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   They will grasp the question instantly and be able to provide a precise and well-articulated answer using appropriate terminology. They might even list multiple features.
    *   *My estimate: 100% full marks* (This is exactly the kind of factual recall they excel at).
