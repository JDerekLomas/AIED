This is a very common question, and one we focus on a lot in Class 6 as part of our 'Physical Features of India' chapter. Even with the language barrier, these terms are often discussed in Hindi and then translated/repeated in English. The names of these major mountain ranges are quite distinct and regularly pointed out on maps.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling:** 15% full marks
* Many of these students struggle with reading English at all. Even if they've heard the names, matching the written form will be hard.
* Some might remember "Himalaya" because it's so prominent, but even writing it correctly could be an issue. They might misspell it badly enough that it's unidentifiable.
* Some might remember "Aravalli" as it's often discussed in the context of older mountains.

**basic:** 60% full marks
* These students can generally decode the question, though they might take some time.
* They've heard these names many times in class and during map work.
* They are likely to remember "Himalayas" easily.
* They can usually recall at least one other major range like "Aravalli," "Vindhya," or "Satpura," especially since we often draw and label them on maps.
* Spelling might not be perfect, but it would be recognizable for one correct answer.

**competent:** 90% full marks
* They will read and understand the question quickly.
* They definitely know the Himalayas.
* They will recall at least one or two other major ranges with good accuracy (e.g., Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats).
* Spelling will be largely correct.

**advanced:** 100% full marks
* This is a straightforward recall question for them.
* They will know several major ranges and will easily list two with correct spelling.
