This is a very common type of question in our English exams. Given the profile of my Class 6 students, here's my assessment:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Many struggling students will not be able to read and comprehend the poem well enough to even identify a "line," let alone articulate *why* they like it. They might point to a random word or try to copy something without understanding.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires both recall (picking a line) and simple reasoning (explaining why). The reasoning part is the biggest hurdle for them.
* **Common Mistakes:** They might just write a random word from the poem, copy a line without explanation, or write "I like it" without further elaboration, usually in Hindi if permitted, or in broken English that isn't connected to the line itself.

**basic: 10% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Some might be able to read and understand the *gist* of some lines, but articulating their "why" will be difficult.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can usually identify a line, but the explanation is where they often fall short. They might offer a very generic explanation like "because it is good" or "I like this idea."
* **Common Mistakes:** Identifying a line but providing a very simplistic, general, or non-specific reason. They might pick a simple line like "The sun shines brightly" and say "because the sun gives light," which is factual but might not convey *liking* in a personal sense.

**competent: 60% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** These students can generally read the poem and understand its core meaning.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall a line and often provide a coherent, if simple, reason. They might connect it to a feeling, an image, or a simple concept from the poem.
* **Common Mistakes:** Their explanation might still be a bit short or less detailed than desired, but it will directly address *why* they like the chosen line. For example, "I like the line 'The birds sing sweet songs' because I like hearing birds in the morning." This is a solid attempt and meets the rubric.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issue here.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will confidently pick a line and provide a clear, logical, and often more insightful reason. They might connect it to personal experience, an emotion, or an appreciation for the imagery or message.
* **Common Mistakes:** A very rare few might misinterpret a line or struggle to articulate their "why" in a sufficiently English way, but generally, they will score full marks.

**Summary for the entire class:** This question would be very challenging for the majority due to the requirement for both comprehension and explanation in English. While identifying a line might be possible for some, explaining *why* they like it requires a higher level of language proficiency and critical thinking that is not common in struggling and basic students.
