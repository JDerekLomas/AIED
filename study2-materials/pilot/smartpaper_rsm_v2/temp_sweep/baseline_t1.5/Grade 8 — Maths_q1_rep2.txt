Here's my assessment based on my experience:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
* **Reasoning:** The combination of English (even simple math equations can be tricky for those struggling with the language) and the negative answer is a significant hurdle. Many would struggle to even read "Find the value of y in the equation." The concept of balancing an equation, especially when it results in a negative number, is often new or poorly grasped. Common mistakes would include `y = 13` (adding 9 and 4) or just getting confused. Some might attempt a guess or try to "solve" it by trial and error but would likely not land on a negative integer.

**basic:** 30% full marks
* **Reasoning:** These students would likely understand the *idea* of an equation and finding a value. Some would be able to read and comprehend the question. The "opposite operation" (subtracting 9 from both sides) might be a concept they've been introduced to, but applying it when the result is negative is often where they falter. Many would instinctively try to get a positive answer. Some might try trial and error and might get lucky if they considered negative numbers, but it's not a given. `y = 13` or `y = 5` (if they swap 9 and 4) would be common errors.

**competent:** 80% full marks
* **Reasoning:** Students in this category would generally understand how to solve basic linear equations. They would read the English question and comprehend it. The concept of inverse operations to isolate `y` would be familiar. The main reason it's not 100% is that occasionally, even competent students can make a small arithmetic error (e.g., miscalculating 4-9) or have a momentary lapse in correctly handling negative numbers if they are rushing or stressed. However, the majority would correctly apply `y = 4 - 9 = -5`.

**advanced:** 100% full marks
* **Reasoning:** These students would have a solid grasp of integers, basic algebraic manipulation, and equation solving. They would read the question fluently, understand the objective, and quickly and accurately solve for `y`. Handling negative numbers would not be an issue for them. This problem requires recall of basic algebraic rules and a simple arithmetic operation with integers, both of which they would be proficient in.
