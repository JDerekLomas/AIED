Here's my breakdown based on my experience:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 5% full marks
competent: 50% full marks
advanced: 90% full marks

**Reasoning:**

Let's break down why I've come to these percentages for a Class 6 English class in a government school with the described student profile:

*   **Language Barriers & Reading Comprehension (All Levels):**
    *   **"Which line from the poem do you like the most..."**: This immediately presents a challenge. Many struggling and even basic students will find it difficult to *read* and *understand* all the lines of a poem, especially if it uses slightly more complex vocabulary or sentence structures. They might identify a line by length or a single recognizable word rather than comprehension.
    *   **"...and why?"**: This is the major hurdle. Even if they can point to a line, explaining *why* requires more than just recognition. It requires articulating a reason, which demands a decent command of English vocabulary and sentence structure, even at a simple level. "I like it because it's good" is a very common default answer, which wouldn't get full marks.

*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:**
    *   This question primarily tests **reasoning and articulation**, not just recall. While recalling a line is the first step, the "why" is the more complex part. Students might recall a few lines but struggle immensely to elaborate on their preference.

*   **Specificity of Required Answer:**
    *   The rubric "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why" is quite specific. A student *must* pick a line and give a *reason*. A reason like "because it sounds good" or "I just like it" is likely too vague for full marks, as it doesn't demonstrate any deeper understanding or personal connection. They need to say *why* it sounds good, or what they like about it.

*   **Common Mistakes My Students Make:**
    *   **Not identifying a line:** Students might give a general answer about the poem (e.g., "I like the poem because it is about nature") without picking a specific line.
    *   **Incorrectly recalling a line:** They might paraphrase or misremember a line.
    *   **Vague "why":** The most common mistake. "It is good," "I like it," "It is nice." These answers show a lack of vocabulary to express more nuanced feelings or a lack of comprehension of *what* about the line appeals to them.
    *   **Hindi Interference:** Many will think of the reason in Hindi and struggle to translate it into simple, coherent English sentences. They might resort to one-word answers or fragmented phrases.
    *   **Copying a peer:** Some will simply copy a line and a very generic "why" from a peer, without genuine understanding.
    *   **Fear of making mistakes:** Some bright students might know *why* but are afraid to articulate it incorrectly in English, leading them to give short, unconvincing answers or no answer at all.

**Detailed Breakdown by Category:**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   *0% full marks:* These students struggle with basic reading. Identifying *any* line reliably, let alone understanding it, is a massive challenge. Even if they somehow point to a line, articulating a "why" beyond a one-word answer like "good" or "nice" (which wouldn't get full marks) is almost impossible for them in English. They would likely either leave it blank, point randomly, or give a non-specific answer.

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   *5% full marks:* A small percentage might be able to read and understand one or two simpler lines from the poem. They might pick a relatively straightforward line. The challenge is still the "why." A very few might be able to construct a simple, two-to-three-word reason like "It talks about birds" (if the line is about birds), which *might* just scrape full marks if interpreted leniently. Most will offer "It is good" or struggle to phrase anything. They might get partial credit for identifying a line, but the "why" will be the stumbling block.

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   *50% full marks:* This group has a reasonable chance. They can read and understand most lines. They have enough vocabulary to articulate a simple reason. For example, "I like the line 'The sun shines bright' because it makes me feel happy" or "I like 'The birds sing sweetly' because I love listening to birds." The other 50% might identify a line but still give a somewhat
