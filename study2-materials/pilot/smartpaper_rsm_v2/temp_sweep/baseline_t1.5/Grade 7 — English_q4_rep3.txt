Here's my breakdown based on experience:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Do you think," "important," "real life," and "reason" are all abstract concepts that many struggling students will not grasp, let alone be able to articulate a response for. They'd likely just stare blankly or give a random answer not connected to the text.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question demands reasoning, which is a higher-order skill. They might recall *what* the questions were, but understanding their *importance* and applying it to "real life" is beyond them.
* **Specific answer:** While the rubric is somewhat flexible ("any valid reason"), expressing that valid reason in English is the challenge.
* **Common mistakes:** No response, single word answers unrelated to the question, or simply repeating a phrase from the text without understanding.

**basic: 10% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Some might understand the *gist* of the question but struggle to formulate a coherent English sentence. They might grasp "important" but linking it to "real life" and then providing a "reason" is tough.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall the king's questions. Some might make a rudimentary connection between "right time" and "important" in a general sense, but explaining *why* will be the stumbling block.
* **Specific answer:** A very few might manage a simple, valid reason like "Yes, because it helps us to do work good." or "Yes, if we know these things, we will be successful."
* **Common mistakes:** Yes/No answers without a reason, very garbled reasons, or reasons that don't directly address the *importance* in real life. They might just reiterate the questions.

**competent: 60% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Most would understand the question clearly. They have enough vocabulary and sentence structure to attempt an answer.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can definitely recall the questions. They are capable of basic reasoning and linking the king's questions to practical outcomes.
* **Specific answer:** They would likely give reasons like: "Yes, because knowing the right time helps us to complete tasks efficiently," "Yes, it is important to know the right people to help us," or "Yes, we need to know the right thing to do so we don't make mistakes." They might not be highly sophisticated but would be valid and understandable.
* **Common mistakes:** Some might provide a reason that is a bit vague, or perhaps focuses on only one of the king's questions rather than the collective importance. Some might still struggle with perfectly grammatical English, but the core meaning would be there.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issue here. They will understand the nuances of the question.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will easily recall the questions and readily apply higher-order thinking to connect them to real-life scenarios, demonstrating clear understanding of their practical importance.
* **Specific answer:** They will provide articulate and well-reasoned answers. For example, "Yes, these questions are profoundly important in real life because making timely decisions, performing the correct actions, and collaborating with the appropriate individuals are foundational for personal success, effective leadership, and achieving desired outcomes in any endeavor."
* **Common mistakes:** A very rare grammatical error or a reason that is slightly less sophisticated, but still perfectly valid and demonstrates full understanding.
