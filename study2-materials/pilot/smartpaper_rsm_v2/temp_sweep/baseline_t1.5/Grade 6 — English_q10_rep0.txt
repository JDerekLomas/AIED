This is a classic question that highlights the challenges faced in our Class 6 English classroom. Here's my breakdown based on my experience:

**struggling: 0-5% full marks**
For these students, the concept of "some/any" is completely alien. Many will struggle to even read "some" and "any" correctly, let alone understand their meaning in context. They might just guess randomly or be unable to attempt it. Their focus is often on basic vocabulary and sentence structure, not the nuances of quantifiers. If anyone gets it right, it's likely a lucky guess.

**basic: 20-30% full marks**
These students might have encountered "some" and "any" before, perhaps through rote learning of specific sentence patterns like "Are there any...?" or "There are some...". However, their understanding is fragile. They might not fully grasp the rule that "some" is generally used in affirmative sentences and "any" in negative or interrogative ones. They might get confused because they see "apples" and think of counting, or they might associate "any" with "no" which isn't the case here. Some might recall the correct pattern for an affirmative statement.

**competent: 70-80% full marks**
These students generally have a better grasp of basic grammar rules, including the use of quantifiers. They might have been taught the rule explicitly, or they've picked it up through more exposure to English texts. They would likely identify "apples in the basket" as a positive statement and correctly choose "some." However, even within this group, some might falter if they're still building their reading fluency or get confused by similar-sounding words or common Hindi-English interference patterns.

**advanced: 95-100% full marks**
For the advanced students, this question would be straightforward. They've likely mastered this grammar point and can apply the rule confidently. They read the sentence, identify it as an affirmative statement about the existence of something, and immediately know that "some" is the correct choice. They would also be able to explain *why* "some" is correct if asked.
