This is a very common question for Class 6 Social Science, and it deals with basic geography of India. Let's break down how different groups of students might perform.

**struggling: 10% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Many in this group would struggle just to read and understand the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." They might not grasp "major mountain ranges" or even "located in India."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is purely recall. They either know it or they don't. For this group, basic factual recall like this is often weak if not constantly reinforced in their native language.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might write names of cities, rivers, or just random words. If they recognize "India," they might write "India" as an answer. They might recall *one* range but miss the requirement for *two* due to reading comprehension issues.

**basic: 40% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** This group would likely be able to decipher the question with some effort, though they might not fully understand "major." They would definitely understand "mountain ranges" and "India."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall "Himalayas" easily as it's the most prominent. They might struggle to recall a second one accurately. "Aravalli" is often taught early as well due to its historical significance in Rajasthan.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Many would write only one range (likely Himalayas), missing the "any two" part due to hurried reading or limited recall. Some might misspell the ranges significantly, but I would likely accept it given the context of a government school and the focus on content.

**competent: 80% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They would read and understand the question clearly without issues.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would easily recall at least two major ranges. Himalayas would be immediate, and then Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, or Eastern Ghats would likely follow. They've heard these repeatedly.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very few mistakes for this group. Perhaps a minor spelling error for a less common range, but they would definitely get two correct names.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue whatsoever.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would quickly list off two or three correctly spelled mountain ranges. They likely have a mental map of India's physical features.
*   **Common Mistakes:** The only way they might miss full marks is a silly mistake, like writing only one name if they were rushing, but it's highly unlikely. They are usually meticulous.
