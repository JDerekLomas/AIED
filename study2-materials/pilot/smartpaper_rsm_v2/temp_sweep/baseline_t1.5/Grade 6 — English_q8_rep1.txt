Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 6 students in a government school, keeping in mind the demographics and mixed abilities.

This kind of sentence arrangement task is common, but the specific wording and student context are key.

**Analysis of the item:**
*   **Target sentence:** "He is reading a book." (Simple present continuous, SVO)
*   **Words provided:** book/reading/a/is/he
*   **Complexity:** The vocabulary is common. The grammatical structure (present continuous) is usually introduced in Class 4 or 5. It requires identifying the subject, auxiliary verb, main verb, article, and object.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** It's more reasoning based on learned sentence structures than pure recall. However, familiarity with this particular structure (S + is/am/are + V-ing + O) is crucial.
*   **Specificity of answer:** Very specific. There's only one grammatically correct and meaningful sentence from these words.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Missing articles or putting them in the wrong place.
    *   Incorrect word order (e.g., "Reading he is a book," "He reading is a book").
    *   Not capitalizing the first word or adding a full stop (though the rubric doesn't mention punctuation, it's a common oversight).
    *   Students sometimes get confused between "is" and "a," especially if they don't fully grasp their functions.

Here's my estimation for full marks:

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** These students often have difficulty decoding individual words, let alone understanding their grammatical roles. They might recognize "he" and "book" but struggle with "reading" and "is." The concept of sentence structure is very weak. They'll likely just string words together randomly or based on visual prominence.
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks** (These would be the rare ones who might just happen to get it right, or who might have recently had this specific structure reinforced one-on-one).

*   **Basic (35% of class):** These students can generally read the words and might understand their individual meanings. They've likely been introduced to present continuous tense. However, they struggle with applying grammatical rules consistently. They might get the subject-verb right ("He is..."), but then struggle with the object placement, or might forget the article. They often make mistakes with the "a" or the verb placement.
    *   **basic: 40% full marks** (Many will get it partially right, but a good chunk will make one minor error like omitting 'a' or incorrect placement. About 40% will manage to string it correctly).

*   **Competent (20% of class):** These students have a solid understanding of basic sentence structures, including the present continuous. They can read fluently enough to process the words and apply the learned rules. They generally know subject-verb-object order and the role of articles. They might pause but will usually arrive at the correct answer.
    *   **competent: 85% full marks** (Most will get this, but there might be a few who rush or overlook something, especially if they are tired or distracted).

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** These students understand grammar concepts well beyond their grade level. They will immediately recognize the required structure and solve this without hesitation. They are likely to apply the correct capitalization and punctuation naturally, even if not explicitly required by the rubric for this question.
    *   **advanced: 100% full marks** (This is a straightforward task for them).

In summary:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 40% full marks
competent: 85% full marks
advanced: 100% full marks
