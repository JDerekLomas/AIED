Let's break down how my students would likely perform on this item, given their backgrounds and my experience.

**Struggling (35% of class):** These students often struggle with basic word recognition and have very limited understanding of English sentence structure. They might pick out familiar words like "book" but struggle to arrange them logically. They are more likely to randomly put words together or just write down what they see. The concept of subject-verb agreement or sentence order is often lost on them.

*   **struggling: 5% full marks** (This 5% might be due to a lucky guess, or perhaps they've been taught this exact sentence frame recently, and it's fresh in their mind. Even then, it's low.)

**Basic (35% of class):** These students can recognize most of the individual words. They might understand that "he" is a person and "book" is an object. They have some exposure to simple English sentences. However, they often make mistakes with the auxiliary verb "is" or the correct placement of "reading." They might come up with "He reading a book" or "He a book reading is." The specific "subject-verb-object" structure with the auxiliary verb can still be tricky for them.

*   **basic: 40% full marks** (Many will get parts right, but the precise SVO order with the auxiliary verb might trip up more than half. They'll show an attempt at order, but not always the correct one.)

**Competent (20% of class):** These students generally understand basic sentence structure and frequently encounter simple sentences like this. They would recognize "he is reading a book" as a common and grammatically correct sentence pattern. They have a decent grasp of English and would apply their understanding of subject-verb-object.

*   **competent: 85% full marks** (The vast majority will get this. There might be one or two who rush or make a silly error, but it's a very standard construction for them.)

**Advanced (10% of class):** For these students, this is a very straightforward task. They have a solid grasp of English grammar and sentence construction. This exercise tests fundamental knowledge that they have already mastered.

*   **advanced: 100% full marks** (This is well within their comfort zone and understanding.)
