Okay, thinking about my Class 6 Social Science students, the mountain ranges question, even with the simple scoring, needs careful consideration.

Here's my breakdown for each group:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** The biggest hurdle. Even if they've heard the names, reading "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" will be difficult. Many won't grasp the core request due to the English.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall, but without understanding the prompt, recall is impossible.
* **Common mistakes:** Will likely leave it blank or write something completely unrelated (e.g., "India," "mountains"). They might even copy what their neighbor writes, but getting two correct is a stretch. Even recognizing *one* word like "mountain" or "India" might make them attempt, but they won't structure two names correctly.

**basic: 10% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They might piece together "mountain" and "India," understanding that they need to name a mountain. "Two" might be missed.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They often remember one prominent name, usually "Himalayas," as it's taught repeatedly and is visually significant on maps. Remembering a second one like Aravalli or Vindhya is harder without strong English recall or focused revision.
* **Common mistakes:** Will often give only one correct answer (Himalayas). If they attempt a second, it might be something vaguely geographical but not a specific range, or an incorrect one. Some might write "पहाड़" (pahad) if allowed Hindi, but not specific ranges. The low percentage here reflects the need for *two* correct answers and the English barrier.

**competent: 50% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They can generally read and understand the prompt.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would have explicitly learned these. Himalayas is a given. They've usually grasped another major one like Aravalli, Vindhya, or Satpura, especially after map work. The requirement for *two* is key here, and they've typically internalized at least two.
* **Common mistakes:** Might occasionally misspell one, but the range would be identifiable. Some might write "mount Everest" instead of a range, demonstrating a slight confusion between peak and range, but usually, they get it right. Missing one name or providing only one is a common issue for the other 50%.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issue here. They'll read and comprehend instantly.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is a straightforward recall task for them. They likely know several ranges.
* **Common mistakes:** A rare spelling error, or perhaps they overthink and try to write four instead of two. The only reason it's not 100% is the possibility of a silly mistake or temporary mental block, which can happen even with the brightest students on simple recall. They'd typically list Himalayas and Aravalli, or Himalayas and Vindhya/Satpura with ease.
