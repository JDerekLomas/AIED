Here's my assessment based on my experience teaching Class 6 English in an Indian government school, considering the student profiles:

The question "Who lived inside the book?" directly asks for recall from the text. The required answer is specific: "a magical fairy" or "fairy".

**Language barriers:** A significant portion of the struggling and even basic students will struggle to read and comprehend the question itself, let alone recall the specific detail from the text. Even if they understand the individual words, putting them together to form meaning is a challenge.
**Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is purely a recall question. Students either remember the specific detail from reading the text (or having it read to them and explained) or they don't.
**Specificity:** The answer needs to be quite specific. "Someone" or "a character" wouldn't be acceptable.
**Common Mistakes:**
*   Misunderstanding the question due to language.
*   Forgetting the specific detail if the story wasn't revisited often or engaged with deeply.
*   Confusing characters from different stories.
*   Providing a generic answer like "a person" or "a character."

Here's my breakdown of expected full marks:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*They will likely not be able to read the question or understand it fully. Even if they somehow remember 'fairy', they might not be able to articulate it in English correctly.*

**basic:** 10% full marks
*Some might recall "fairy" if the story was very recently discussed and emphasized. Their understanding of the question itself might be tenuous, but a good chunk might struggle to phrase the answer correctly even if they know the creature.*

**competent:** 60% full marks
*These students generally understand simple English questions and can recall key details from stories. They would likely remember "fairy." A few might forget or struggle with the "magical" adjective.*

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*These students typically have good comprehension and recall. They would confidently answer "a magical fairy" or "fairy." The 5% margin accounts for a momentary lapse of memory or minor misspellings that might prevent a 'full mark' score if the rubric is very strict.*
