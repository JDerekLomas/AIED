**Explanation from a Teacher's Perspective:**

This question, while seemingly simple, poses several challenges for my diverse Class 7 English students.

**Struggling (35%):** For these students, the biggest hurdle is simply *comprehending* the question itself. "Favourite," "hobby," "when you do it," and "why you enjoy it" might all be unfamiliar or semi-understood words. Many would struggle to even read the prompt fluently, let alone grasp its nuances. Constructing *any* meaningful English sentence, let alone a paragraph that covers specific points, is beyond them at this stage. Their answers, if any, would likely be single words, incomplete phrases, or completely off-topic. For them, this requires significant scaffolding and translation, not independent recall or reasoning.

**Basic (35%):** Students at the basic level can often pick out a few keywords and understand the general gist. They might identify "hobby" and "enjoy." However, they will likely struggle with the sentence structure required for a coherent paragraph. They might list their hobby, but fail to add "when" or "why" adequately. Many might write "My hobby is playing cricket" and "I like cricket." Combining these into grammatically correct sentences and ensuring all elements are present will be a stretch for most. "When you do it" and "why you enjoy it" require slightly more elaborate sentence construction than they are comfortable with. Recall is there, but expressing it coherently is the issue.

**Competent (20%):** These students have a decent grasp of basic English grammar and vocabulary. They will understand the question clearly. They can identify their hobby and express why they like it. The challenge for some might be ensuring all three components (hobby, when, why) are explicitly mentioned in a smooth, paragraph-like flow, rather than just as a list. They might write: "My hobby is reading. I read in the evening. I like it because it is interesting." This is close, but some might forget one element or write it in a slightly disjointed manner. They can recall and apply basic reasoning, but perfection in expression might be lacking for half of them.

**Advanced (10%):** These students are comfortable with English and will likely have no trouble meeting all the criteria. They can form grammatically correct sentences, express their ideas clearly, and ensure all parts of the prompt are addressed in a flowing paragraph. They might add some descriptive language too. This task aligns well with their current abilities. It primarily requires recall and basic reasoning, which they can execute effortlessly.
