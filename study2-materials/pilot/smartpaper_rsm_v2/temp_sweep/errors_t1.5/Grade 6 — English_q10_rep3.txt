REASONING: The common errors show a very low foundational understanding of English grammar and sentence structure.

While "some/any" is a common concept, the general weakness suggests many will struggle even with this relatively straightforward multiple-choice question due to poor exposure, confusion, or a tendency to guess without understanding.
