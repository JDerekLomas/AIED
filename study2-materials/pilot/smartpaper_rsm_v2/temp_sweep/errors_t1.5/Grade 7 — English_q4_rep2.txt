REASONING: Based on the observed error patterns, students struggle significantly with answering analytical and open-ended questions. Even with a direct question, they often give irrelevant answers, show incomplete understanding, or leave it blank. Their writing struggles indicate difficulty forming coherent sentences, especially in response to prompts requiring critical thinking or justification. Given the question asks for a "reason" and relates it to "real life," which requires abstraction beyond simple recall, a very low percentage would score full marks.
