REASONING: Given the pass rate of 4% and the common errors like "I am reading" (which suggests a complete misunderstanding of "writing style" and a focus on their own activity) or empty responses, it's clear students struggle with the concept of literary analysis and the vocabulary to describe it. They likely interpret "describes" literally as something they are doing or fail to grasp "writing style" altogether.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 3%
