REASONING: Given the extremely low pass rates on more complex questions involving comprehension and sentence construction, a simple identification of an adjective like "tiny" might seem straightforward. However, the consistent "Empty Response" and off-topic answers suggest a fundamental lack of understanding of basic grammatical terms and sentence structure. Many students might not even know what an "adjective phrase" is, or even what an "adjective" is, leading to blank answers or incorrect guesses. Even if they identify "tiny" as describing the bird, they might not correctly label it as an "adjective phrase," since the rubric scores just "tiny" as an adjective. Some might point to the whole phrase "a tiny bird" or just "bird," demonstrating confusion.
