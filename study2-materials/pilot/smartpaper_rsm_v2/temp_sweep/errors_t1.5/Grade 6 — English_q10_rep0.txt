REASONING: Given the high percentage of "Empty Response" and off-topic answers in previous questions, many students might struggle to even attempt this question due to limited vocabulary and comprehension. However, the question is a direct "fill in the blank" and doesn't require complex sentence formation or deep understanding of a text, which might be slightly less intimidating than descriptive questions. Some students may guess correctly even if they don't fully understand the rule.
