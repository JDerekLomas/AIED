REASONING: Students may struggle with calculating the time difference correctly, especially converting from "am" to "pm" and counting hours. Many might calculate a simple difference (like 4-10, which is incorrect in terms of hours passed) or miss the initial hour. Some may also correctly find 6 hours, but struggle with the subsequent multiplication or addition steps for the final temperature, but since the rubric only focuses on calculating elapsed time, the issues might be limited to just the time calculation itself.
