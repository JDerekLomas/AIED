REASONING: Students struggle with expressing scientific concepts in English, often resorting to basic vocabulary or incorrect terminology. The question requires explaining decomposition and its benefits, which involves vocabulary like "decomposition," "manure," "nutrients," and "beneficial," which are beyond many students' current proficiency. They might recognize "gobar" or "khaad" but fail to connect it to the decomposition process or explain its benefits for soil health coherently.
