REASONING: Based on the low pass rates on other questions requiring specific grammatical knowledge or conceptual understanding, and the prevalence of incomplete or off-topic responses, most students will likely struggle to identify "tiny" as an adjective, let alone "tiny bird" as an adjective phrase (though the rubric only asks for "tiny"). Many may leave it blank or guess incorrectly due to a lack of foundational grammar knowledge.
