REASONING: Given the high percentage of empty responses or irrelevant answers for questions with higher cognitive demands, I anticipate many students will either leave this question blank or provide answers that are not mountain ranges, especially if they struggle with recalling specific geographical terms. However, some might correctly recall at least one major range like the Himalayas due to its prominence.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
