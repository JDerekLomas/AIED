REASONING: Given the prevalence of empty responses and off-topic answers in more complex questions, a question asking about basic occupations in a specific region, especially Rajasthan which is often covered, should see a slightly higher success rate. However, detailing one occupation "in brief" might be a challenge for some due to limited English or difficulty in expressing thoughts, even if they know the answer in their local language.
