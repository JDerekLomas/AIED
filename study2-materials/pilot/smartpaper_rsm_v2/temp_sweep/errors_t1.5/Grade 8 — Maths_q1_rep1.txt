REASONING: Many students will struggle with the concept of negative numbers, especially when it involves "subtracting" a larger number from a smaller one or "moving" a positive number across the equals sign to become negative. They might guess a positive number that makes the left side bigger (e.g., 4-9=-5 but they might make it 9-4=5 so y=5). Some might also just be doing guess and check without formal algebraic steps and arrive at an incorrect answer due to weak number sense.
