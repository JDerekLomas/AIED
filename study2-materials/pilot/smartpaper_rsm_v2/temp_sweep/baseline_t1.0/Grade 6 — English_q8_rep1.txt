Here's my assessment based on my experience:

struggling: **5%** full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Many struggle to even recognize individual words, let alone understand their meaning or grammatical function. "Reading" might be recognized by a few, but "book" might not be.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires a basic understanding of English sentence structure (SVO), which is often not internalized by struggling learners. They'd primarily be guessing or looking for familiar patterns, which are few.
*   **Specificity:** The exact SVO order is crucial, making it difficult for them.
*   **Common mistakes:** They would likely put words in any order they recognize, perhaps "book reading he is a" or "a book he reading is." They don't have the internal grammar rule to guide them.

basic: **30%** full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They can likely read most of the individual words. "He," "is," "a," "book" are high-frequency words they've encountered. "Reading" might be a bit more challenging but recognizable.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They might have been introduced to simple SVO sentences but haven't fully internalized it. They might try to recall a similar sentence they've heard or seen.
*   **Specificity:** They understand the concept of "doing something with a book," but the exact word order might still be tricky.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might get "He is reading" but then struggle with "a book," sometimes placing "a" after "book" or getting the verb tense mixed up if the words were more complex. "He reading is a book" is a common error, showing they understand the main subject and action but not the auxiliary verb placement.

competent: **75%** full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They can read and understand all the words.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They have a foundational understanding of basic English sentence structure (SVO). They can apply this rule.
*   **Specificity:** They are generally comfortable with this level of rearrangement.
*   **Common mistakes:** A small percentage might still make a minor error if they rush or misread, but generally, they will get the correct SVO order.

advanced: **95%** full marks
*   **Language barriers:** No issue at all.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They fully understand and can apply SVO structure without difficulty. This is a very basic task for them.
*   **Specificity:** They will easily form the correct sentence.
*   **Common mistakes:** The only reason for a lost mark would be extreme carelessness, not a lack of understanding.
