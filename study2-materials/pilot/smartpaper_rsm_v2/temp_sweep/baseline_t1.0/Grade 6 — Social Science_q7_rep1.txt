Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 6 students in an Indian government school, keeping all the context in mind.

First, let's consider the question and the rubric:
**Question:** Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.
**Scoring rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy). Max score: 1

Hold on, the rubric seems to only score for *mentioning two resources*, not for *explaining the influence*. This makes the scoring very lenient for the first part of the question. If the *full marks* are given *only* for mentioning two resources, then the percentage will be higher. However, typically, a question with two parts (mentioning AND explaining) would expect both for full marks. Let me assume the rubric provided is for a *partial* score, and "full marks on this item" implies getting both parts right as intended by the question.

Let's re-evaluate based on a common-sense understanding of "full marks" for a two-part question, assuming the provided rubric is just for one component.
**Revised interpretation for "full marks on this item":**
1.  Mentions two correct natural resources found in Rajasthan. (e.g., Water, Marble, Copper, Sand, Sunlight, Salt, Gypsum, etc.)
2.  Explains how *one* of these influences the lives of the people there. (e.g., Water scarcity leads to reliance on wells/canals, impact on agriculture; Marble used for construction/crafts, providing livelihood; Solar energy potential due to abundant sunlight.)

If "full marks" genuinely means just "Mentions two correct natural resources," as per the provided rubric text, then the percentages would be much higher, especially for "competent" and "advanced" students, as recalling two names is much easier.

Let's assume the question's intent for "full marks" means answering both parts.

**Analysis:**

*   **Language barriers:** "Natural resources," "influences," "lives of the people" are key terms. Many students, especially the struggling ones, will struggle to read and comprehend the question fully in English. They might catch "Rajasthan" and "resources" but miss the nuance of "influences."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:**
    *   *Recalling two natural resources*: This is primarily recall. Students who have attended classes, seen pictures, or learned local examples will have an easier time.
    *   *Explaining influence*: This requires a basic level of reasoning and connecting the resource to human activities/livelihoods. This is where many will struggle, especially if their vocabulary is limited and they can't formulate sentences to express the connection.
*   **Specificity:** The resources need to be specific to Rajasthan. "Water" is general, but its *scarcity* or presence of *lakes/canals* makes it specific. "Marble," "Copper," "Salt" are very specific and commonly taught.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Mentioning only one resource.
    *   Mentioning resources not found in Rajasthan (e.g., coal, petroleum if they just recall general resources).
    *   Not attempting the "explanation" part at all.
    *   Giving very generic explanations that don't specifically link to *how* it influences lives (e.g., "Water is important").
    *   Grammar and spelling errors making their answer unclear, even if they have the right idea.
    *   Copying the question directly or giving very short, incomplete answers due to language limitations.

**Percentage Estimates (assuming "full marks" requires both parts: two resources + one explanation):**

*   **struggling: 0% full marks**
    *   They might recall one resource, maybe two, but the "explain how it influences" part will be a major hurdle. Their English comprehension and sentence construction skills are simply not adequate for this level of explanation. They might give a one-word answer or a very broken sentence that doesn't convey the meaning.
*   **basic: 10% full marks**
    *   A small percentage of these students might recall two resources and manage a very simple, perhaps grammatically imperfect, but understandable explanation. They might say something like "Pani bahut kam hai, isliye log kheti nahi kar pate." (Water is very less, so people cannot do farming) and I would accept that as valid. Their biggest challenge will be formulating the explanation in English or even thinking it through clearly.
