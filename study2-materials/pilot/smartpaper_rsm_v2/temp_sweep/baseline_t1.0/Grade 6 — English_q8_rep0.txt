This is a very common type of sentence rearrangement question, and while it seems simple, the specific context of my classroom makes it a bit tricky.

*   **Language barriers:** Many struggling students will not recognize *reading* or *book* immediately, or will try to translate word-by-word into Hindi sentence structure.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires recalling basic SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) sentence structure. While *He is reading a book* is a very common pattern, the ability to apply it consistently when the words are jumbled is the challenge.
*   **Specificity:** The answer is very specific. Any deviation (e.g., "A book is he reading") would be incorrect.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Incorrect word order, especially putting the object before the verb/subject (e.g., "Book reading he is").
    *   Missing articles or prepositions (though not applicable here, it's a general trend).
    *   Students might struggle to identify the subject and verb first. They might start with "reading a book" and then try to fit "he is" in.

Here's my estimation:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 40% full marks
competent: 85% full marks
advanced: 100% full marks
