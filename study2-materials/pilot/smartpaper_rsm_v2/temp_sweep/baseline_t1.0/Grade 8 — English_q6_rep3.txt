This is a common question, and given the student profile, I'd anticipate the following:

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** 0% full marks. They would struggle to recall the definition and articulate it in English. Even if they've heard the word, connecting it to "animals" and "moral" in a coherent sentence would be very difficult. They might say "a story" or "a animal story" at best, but not hit all the required points.

*   **Basic (35% of class):** 10% full marks. Some might recall parts of the definition (e.g., "animal story" or "story with a moral") but struggle to combine them into a complete and accurate sentence. The 10% would be those who have a slightly better grasp of English vocabulary and sentence structure, and perhaps remember a specific fable discussed in class that helped them internalize the concept.

*   **Competent (20% of class):** 50% full marks. These students generally understand what a fable is. They might be able to articulate "short story, animals, moral" but might miss one of the nuances like "typically uses" or the perfect phrasing. The 50% who score full marks would be those who have a strong enough vocabulary and grammar to construct the precise definition.

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** 90% full marks. These students are likely to have encountered fables and their definitions multiple times, perhaps through independent reading or other resources. Their stronger English proficiency would allow them to articulate the definition accurately and completely. The 10% who don't get full marks might be due to a minor slip in phrasing or forgetting one specific element, but it would be rare.

**Breakdown of anticipated full marks:**

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 10% full marks
competent: 50% full marks
advanced: 90% full marks
