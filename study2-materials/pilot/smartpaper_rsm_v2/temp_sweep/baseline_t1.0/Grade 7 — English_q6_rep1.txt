This is a great question that hits on many of the real challenges we face in the classroom. Here's my breakdown:

**Understanding the Context:**
The question "Describes the poet's writing style" is deceptively simple. For students who have limited English proficiency, even understanding "describes," "poet's," and "writing style" can be a hurdle. The instruction "Identifies a suitable and relevant word" implies a level of abstract thinking and vocabulary that is often underdeveloped in these students.

**Language Barriers:**
Many of my students might struggle to understand "writing style" itself. They might think it's about handwriting, or the way the poem *looks* on the page. Even if they grasp the concept, finding an *appropriate English word* to describe it, beyond very basic adjectives like "good" or "bad," is difficult.

**Recall vs. Reasoning:**
This question requires reasoning, not just recall. They need to read the poem, understand its tone, structure, and language use, and then *deduce* a suitable descriptive word. This is a higher-order thinking skill. If we haven't explicitly taught them different writing styles (e.g., narrative, lyrical, didactic) and the vocabulary to describe them, it's a huge ask.

**Specificity of the Answer:**
"Simple, descriptive, informal, direct" are good examples, but even these words might be new vocabulary for many. Common mistakes would include giving a general opinion ("good poem"), describing the *topic* of the poem instead of the style, or simply not knowing what word to use.

**Common Mistakes:**
*   **Misunderstanding "writing style":** They might describe the poet's personality or the poem's subject.
*   **Limited vocabulary:** Even if they understand the concept, they might only know "good" or "beautiful."
*   **Translating literally:** Trying to translate a Hindi concept of style into English might not yield a suitable English word.
*   **Focusing on the poet's message/theme:** Confusing style with content.

Here's my estimate:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 5% full marks
competent: 40% full marks
advanced: 70% full marks
