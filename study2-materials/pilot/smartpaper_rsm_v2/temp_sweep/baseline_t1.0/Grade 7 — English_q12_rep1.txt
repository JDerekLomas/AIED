Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 7 English students in a government school, keeping in mind their background and the specific challenges.

The sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is a simple past tense active voice sentence. Transforming it to passive voice requires understanding the subject-verb-object structure, knowing the past participle of "blow" (blown), and correctly using the auxiliary verb "were" for plural "leaves."

Here's my estimation for full marks:

*   **struggling:** **0% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** Many wouldn't even be able to read and comprehend the sentence fully. Identifying the subject, verb, and object would be a significant challenge. Recalling "blown" and correctly using "were" would be beyond them. Their common mistakes would be: not attempting, changing tenses, trying to rephrase the active sentence, or completely misunderstanding the task.
*   **basic:** **10% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** Some might grasp the concept of "changing the voice" if I've taught it extensively, but applying it accurately to this specific sentence would be tough. They might identify "leaves" as the new subject and know "blown" but struggle with "were" or the full construction. They might write "The leaves blown away by the wind" (missing 'were') or "The leaves was blown away" (subject-verb agreement error). A small percentage who've specifically practiced this exact type of sentence might get it right.
*   **competent:** **60% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** These students would generally understand the concept of active/passive voice for simple tenses. They'd likely identify the parts of the sentence correctly. Their main challenge might be recalling "blown" instantly or ensuring perfect subject-verb agreement with "were." Some might make a minor spelling error or miss "by the wind" (though the rubric suggests it's required for full marks). The majority should be able to get it, possibly after a moment of thought.
*   **advanced:** **90% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** These students would have a solid grasp of grammar concepts, including active/passive voice. They would read the sentence, identify the tense and parts, and transform it correctly with confidence. Any errors would likely be minor slips, like a missing full stop or a very slight misspelling, rather than a fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation. They've likely seen and practiced many such transformations.
