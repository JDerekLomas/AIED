This is a common grammar point, but the nuances of 'some' and 'any' can be tricky for students with limited exposure to English. Considering the background and varied abilities:

**struggling:** 10% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Many wouldn't be able to read and comprehend the sentence and the options properly. They might guess based on a familiar sound or a random choice.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires a specific recall of the rule for 'some' in affirmative sentences, which they likely haven't firmly grasped yet, or reasoning that 'any' is for negatives/questions.
*   **Common mistakes:** Random guessing, or picking 'any' if they've only heard it in simple questions like "Do you have any?" without understanding the context.

**basic:** 30% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They might be able to decode the words but struggle with the full meaning of the sentence.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Some might have encountered this rule before, perhaps during rote learning, but not internalized it for application. They might recognize "apples in the basket" as a common phrase, but the choice between 'some' and 'any' is where they falter.
*   **Common mistakes:** Confusing 'some' and 'any' in affirmative statements, or just guessing if they are unsure. They might have a vague idea but lack confidence.

**competent:** 70% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They should be able to read and understand the sentence clearly.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would likely have been taught this rule explicitly and practised it. They understand that 'some' is for affirmative statements and 'any' for negatives or questions. This is a fairly standard grammar point for their level.
*   **Common mistakes:** A few might make a careless error, or if they are still processing the rule, might second-guess themselves.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** No issue at all.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would immediately identify this as a straightforward application of the 'some/any' rule in an affirmative sentence. This would be a basic recall task for them.
*   **Common mistakes:** Very rare, perhaps a moment of distraction or a very unusual interpretation, but highly unlikely.
