This is a very common type of question in our Social Science class, and one we try to make accessible even with language barriers.

struggling: 10% full marks
basic: 60% full marks
competent: 90% full marks
advanced: 100% full marks

Here's my thinking:

*   **Language barriers:** While the question is in English, "mountain ranges" and "India" are likely words they've heard frequently in class, especially when we use a map and point things out. I would also write the question on the board and might even quickly say it in Hindi, "Bharat mein koi do pramukh parvat shrinkhalaon ke naam batao." This helps bridge the gap significantly for the struggling and basic learners. Even without direct translation, the visual of "mountain" often helps them connect the English word to their understanding.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall. We would have spent a good amount of time in class identifying and naming major physical features of India.
*   **Specificity:** The answer only requires *one* correct name for 0.5 marks. This is quite generous. Most students would know at least the Himalayas.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Struggling:** Might misspell names, especially if they are trying to write in English for the first time. They might only remember one, or mix up a mountain range with a plain or a river. Some might draw a blank due to anxiety or not having fully grasped the concept despite repetition.
    *   **Basic:** Most would likely remember "Himalayas." Many would also recall "Aravalli" or "Vindhya" because these are often discussed in relation to their regions. They might struggle to recall a second one or misspell it.
    *   **Competent:** Would easily recall two or more, with good spelling.
    *   **Advanced:** Would have no trouble at all.

Given that only *one* correct name is needed for full marks (0.5), it significantly increases the chances, especially for the basic and even some struggling learners who might only remember "Himalayas." If it required *two* names for full marks, the percentages would drop quite a bit for the struggling and basic groups.
