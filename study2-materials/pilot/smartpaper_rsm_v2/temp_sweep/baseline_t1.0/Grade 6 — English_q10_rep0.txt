This is a good question that highlights a common grammatical point that often confuses students, especially those from Hindi-medium backgrounds. Let's break down how my students would likely perform.

First, let's consider the nature of the question: "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket."

*   **Language barriers:** Many struggling and even basic students would find it hard to *read* and *comprehend* the question itself, let alone the nuance between "some" and "any." The vocabulary ("apples," "basket") might be familiar visually, but reading it as a sentence is a challenge.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires a specific rule recall (some for affirmative sentences, any for negative/interrogative). While some reasoning might be applied if they understand the context, it's primarily a recall task.
*   **Specificity:** The answer is very specific. There's only one correct choice.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Using "any" in affirmative sentences (a very common direct translation error from Hindi where "कोई" can be used for "some" and "any").
    *   Guessing randomly due to lack of understanding.
    *   Not understanding the difference between the two words at all.
    *   Struggling to read the options themselves.

Here's my breakdown by ability level:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   These students will struggle to even read the sentence and the options. If they score, it will likely be a lucky guess or because they've seen this exact sentence/rule drilled repetitively and have memorized the answer without understanding. Their understanding of "some" vs. "any" is virtually nonexistent.

**basic:** 30% full marks
*   These students can likely read the sentence and options, but their comprehension of the grammatical rule is shaky. They might have heard the rule ("some in positive, any in negative/question"), but they often misapply it or get confused under pressure. A significant portion might still default to "any" out of habit or confusion with Hindi usage. They would need a recent review or direct teaching of this specific rule to perform well.

**competent:** 75% full marks
*   These students generally understand the basic rules of grammar. They would likely recall that "some" is used for affirmative sentences and "any" for negative or interrogative ones. They might pause for a moment to confirm, but the majority would get this correct. Some might still make a careless error or momentarily confuse the rule if not recently reinforced.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   These students would immediately identify this as an affirmative sentence and apply the rule correctly without hesitation. They have a solid grasp of basic grammar rules and would have encountered and mastered this distinction previously. The only reason for a lost point would be extreme carelessness or misunderstanding of the question's intent (which is unlikely).
