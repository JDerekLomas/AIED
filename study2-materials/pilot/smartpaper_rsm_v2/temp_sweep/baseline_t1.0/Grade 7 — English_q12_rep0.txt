Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 7 English students in a government school, keeping in mind their background and varying proficiencies.

**The sentence:** "The wind blew the leaves away."
**Passive voice:** "The leaves were blown away by the wind."

**Thinking Process:**

*   **Language barriers (reading English):** This is a significant hurdle. Even reading "blew" and understanding its past tense meaning can be tricky for the struggling group. "Away" might also be confusing.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires both. Students need to *recall* the structure of passive voice (object + be verb + past participle + by + subject). They also need to *reason* to identify the object, the correct form of "be" (past tense plural for "leaves"), and the past participle of "blow."
*   **Specificity of answer:** The answer is very specific. Missing "were," using "was," using "blowed" instead of "blown," or omitting "by the wind" would all lead to losing marks.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Identifying object/subject:** Confusing "wind" and "leaves."
    *   **Tense errors:** Using present tense "are blown" instead of "were blown."
    *   **Verb form:** Using "blowed" or just "blow" instead of "blown." This is a major one for irregular verbs.
    *   **Omitting "by the wind":** Often forgotten, especially if they struggle with the full structure.
    *   **Word order issues:** Mixing up "away" with other parts of the sentence.

Here's my prediction:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*They would likely struggle to identify the object and subject, understand the past tense, and certainly wouldn't know the past participle "blown." Even if they know "active-passive," applying it to this sentence with an irregular verb and a phrasal verb ("blew away") would be too complex. They might attempt something like "The leaves wind blow" or "The leaves blew by the wind" if prompted.*

**basic: 10% full marks**
*Some might get the "The leaves..." part and maybe even "by the wind." The biggest hurdle will be "were blown." They might use "are blown" (tense error) or "were blowed" (incorrect past participle). A very small fraction, those who have recently revised this topic and remember "blown," might get it right. They rely heavily on rote learning the structure.*

**competent: 60% full marks**
*This group understands the basic active-passive transformation. They would correctly identify "The leaves" as the new subject and "by the wind" as the agent. Their main challenge would be recalling the correct past participle "blown" (irregular verb) and ensuring the 'be' verb is in the correct tense and number ("were"). Most would get "were," but a significant number might still slip up on "blown" vs. "blowed" or forget "away." Those who correctly recall "blown" would get full marks.*

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*These students generally grasp grammatical concepts well. They would likely identify the object, apply the correct tense for 'be' (were), and correctly recall the past participle "blown." The only potential slip-up could be a momentary lapse in recalling the irregular verb form or possibly misplacing "away," but most would get it perfectly.*
