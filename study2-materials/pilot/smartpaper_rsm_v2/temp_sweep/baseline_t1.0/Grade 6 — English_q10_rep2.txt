This is a classic 'some/any' distinction, which can be tricky for students, especially those from Hindi-medium backgrounds, as direct translation doesn't always work and the rules for positive/negative/questions are specific.

Here's my breakdown for this particular question:

*   **Language barriers:** Reading "There are... apples in the basket" itself might be slow for struggling students. They might not fully grasp the meaning of "apples" or "basket" immediately, even if they recognize the words. The choice between "some" and "any" requires understanding the *affirmative* nature of the sentence, which can be hard if the overall sentence comprehension is weak.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires recall of a grammar rule (some for positive statements, any for negative/questions) and then applying a bit of reasoning to identify the sentence type.
*   **Specificity:** The answer is very specific. There's only one correct choice.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Confusing 'some' and 'any' generally.
    *   Not recognizing the sentence as an affirmative statement.
    *   Guessing without understanding the rule.
    *   Sometimes students associate 'any' with plural things, which isn't the rule.
    *   Over-reliance on literal translation from Hindi, which doesn't directly map to 'some/any' rules in the same way.

Here's my estimated score breakdown:

struggling: 10% full marks (Likely guessing, or a few might have grasped the *very basic* idea if explicitly taught recently and very simply through examples.)
basic: 40% full marks (Many will have been exposed to the rule, but might still struggle with consistent application or quickly recalling it. They might get it right by luck or if the rule was recently reinforced.)
competent: 75% full marks (They would generally understand the rule for positive statements. Minor errors might occur due to carelessness or momentary confusion.)
advanced: 95% full marks (These students would likely know this rule well and apply it consistently without much thought.)
