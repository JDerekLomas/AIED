Alright, let's break this down from the perspective of teaching Class 8 Social Science in our government school.

The question asks to describe one key feature of Harappan Civilization's urban planning. This is a direct recall question. The specific features like grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, and citadel/lower town are standard topics covered.

Here's my estimation for full marks:

*   **Struggling (35% of students): 5% full marks**
    *   **Reasons:** Their biggest hurdle is often the English itself. "Key feature," "urban planning," "Harappan Civilization" – these terms might be difficult to decode, even if we've discussed them in Hindi. Even if they recall "Mohanjodaro ki naaliyan" (drainage of Mohenjodaro), framing it as "advanced drainage system" in English will be a challenge. They might just write "drainage" which isn't a *description*. Many will mix up civilizations or write something completely irrelevant due to poor comprehension.
*   **Basic (35% of students): 40% full marks**
    *   **Reasons:** They will likely understand the question's intent. They know Harappan Civilization is important and associate it with cities. They've probably memorized a few key points. They might recall "well-planned city" or "good drainage system" (achchi naaliyan). They might not use perfect English, but they'll get the core idea across in a way that shows understanding. For example, "Streets were straight like a grid" or "They had very good drainage pipes." This would likely get them full marks.
*   **Competent (20% of students): 85% full marks**
    *   **Reasons:** These students grasp concepts well and can articulate them reasonably in English. They will recall specific features like "grid pattern of streets," "advanced drainage system," or "use of baked bricks." Their language will be clearer and more precise. They might even try to elaborate slightly, like "The city was divided into two parts: a citadel and a lower town."
*   **Advanced (10% of students): 95% full marks**
    *   **Reasons:** They will confidently answer with precise terminology and good sentence structure. They've likely internalized these facts and can easily retrieve and express them. They might even offer multiple features, although only one is required. The 5% who might not get full marks would be due to a rare moment of oversight or perhaps misinterpreting "describe" if they just list a word.

**Common Mistakes I anticipate:**

*   **Language barrier:** Not understanding "urban planning" or "key feature."
*   **Vague answers:** Just writing "good city" or "naaliyan" without describing it as "advanced" or "well-planned."
*   **Lack of specificity:** Not mentioning *what kind* of bricks (baked) or *how* the streets were planned (grid).
*   **Mixing up civilizations:** Attributing features of other civilizations to Harappan or vice-versa.
*   **Incomplete sentences:** One-word answers due to difficulty forming sentences in English.

My teaching strategy for this would involve drilling these key features repeatedly, using visual aids, translating terms into Hindi, and practicing writing short descriptive sentences in English for each feature. We'd focus on simple, direct language.
