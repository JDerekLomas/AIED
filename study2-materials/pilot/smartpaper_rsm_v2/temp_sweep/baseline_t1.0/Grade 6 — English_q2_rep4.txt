Here's my breakdown for the question "Who lived inside the book?" based on my experience with Class 6 English students in a government school in India:

**Thinking Process:**

*   **Source of the question:** This question clearly comes from a specific text they would have studied. Let's assume it's a story where a magical fairy lives inside a book. This is a direct recall question.
*   **Language Barrier (Reading):** For struggling students, even reading and understanding "Who lived inside the book?" can be a hurdle. They might recognize "book" and "lived" but struggle with "who" and the overall sentence structure.
*   **Language Barrier (Answering):** Even if they understand the question, formulating the answer "a magical fairy" can be difficult. They might know the *character* but not be able to articulate it in English. They might say "pari" (Hindi for fairy) or point.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is 100% recall. If they haven't memorized or understood this specific detail from the story, they won't get it right.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** "a magical fairy" or "fairy" is specific enough. "A girl" or "someone" would be incorrect.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Not understanding the question.
    *   Misremembering the character.
    *   Knowing the character but not being able to write it in English.
    *   Providing a partial answer (e.g., just "fairy" without "a magical"). The rubric says "Accept: 'a magical fairy', 'fairy'", which is helpful.

**Percentage Breakdown:**

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** These students often struggle with basic comprehension and recall of details in English. Many would not even understand the question properly, or if they did, they might not recall the specific detail or be able to write the answer.
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks** (This 5% would be those few who might have somehow memorized this specific fact, or a very few who have a slightly better grasp than their peers in this category and can recall it.)

*   **Basic (35% of class):** These students can usually understand simple questions if read clearly. They might recall some details from the story but often struggle with precise recall and spelling. They might know it's a "fairy" but struggle with "magical" or spelling. Given the acceptance of just "fairy," this helps them.
    *   **basic: 40% full marks** (A good portion of these students would recall "fairy" or "magical fairy" due to direct teaching and repetition. Some might struggle with spelling, but if it's recognizable, it would likely pass.)

*   **Competent (20% of class):** These students generally understand questions well and can recall details with reasonable accuracy. They would likely know the answer and be able to spell it correctly.
    *   **competent: 85% full marks** (The vast majority would get this right. The few who miss it might have a momentary lapse of memory or misread something.)

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** These students have good comprehension, recall, and writing skills. This question would be very straightforward for them.
    *   **advanced: 100% full marks** (They would almost certainly ace this direct recall question.)
