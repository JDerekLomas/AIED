This is a good question that probes both comprehension and real-world application, which is a key goal for my students. However, given their background, I'd anticipate varied success.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Many wouldn't even be able to fully read and comprehend the question itself, let alone the implicit context from the story.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires more than just recall; it asks for a *judgment* about importance in "real life" and a *reason*. This is a significant jump for them.
*   **Common mistakes:** They would likely either remain silent, give a one-word answer completely unrelated, or simply repeat a phrase from the story without understanding.

**basic:** 10% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Some might be able to read the question with some effort, perhaps needing help with a word or two. However, understanding "important in real life" and formulating a *reason* in English is the main hurdle.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall the king's questions, but connecting them to "real life" and then articulating a valid reason is difficult. They might say "yes" but struggle to give a coherent reason.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might say "Yes, because the king wanted to know," which shows some recall but not the reasoning needed for "real life importance." Or they might give a very simple, somewhat relevant reason, but not fully developed. They might also confuse the questions or misinterpret the prompt.

**competent:** 60% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They can read and understand the question clearly.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall the king's questions. The jump to "real life" and providing a reason is within their grasp. They understand the *concept* of importance and can link it to the practical implications of the king's search.
*   **Common mistakes:** Some might give a slightly generic reason or struggle to articulate it perfectly in English, but the core idea would be there. For instance, they might say "Yes, because it helps us to do things correctly."

**advanced:** 90% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** No issues here.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will effortlessly recall the questions and understand the prompt. They can articulate a clear, concise, and valid reason, often linking it directly to decision-making, efficiency, or avoiding mistakes. They are comfortable expressing abstract ideas.
*   **Common mistakes:** A very rare mistake might be a minor grammatical error, but the content would be spot on.

**Overall Reflection:**
The biggest hurdle is the *reasoning* and *articulation* in English, not just recalling the king's questions. Many can tell you *what* the questions were, but answering *why* they are important *in real life* requires a higher level of cognitive and linguistic skill. I'd likely need to scaffold this significantly in class, perhaps by brainstorming examples of "right time," "right thing," "right people" from their own lives first.
