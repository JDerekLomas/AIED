Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 6 English students in a government school, keeping in mind the demographics and mixed abilities.

First, the context: This question "Who lived inside the book?" implies that the students have *read* the story in which this detail is mentioned. Assuming this is a direct recall question from a story we've recently covered, my analysis would be:

**Analysis of the question and required answer:**

*   **Language barriers:** "Who lived inside the book?" is a relatively simple sentence structure. "Who" and "inside" are common words. "Lived" might be a bit tricky for some struggling students if they don't immediately connect it to "live."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is 100% recall. There's no reasoning involved. They either remember the detail from the story or they don't.
*   **Specificity of answer:** "a magical fairy" or "fairy" is very specific. They can't just say "a person" or "a creature."
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Misremembering the character (e.g., confusing it with another character from the same story or a different story).
    *   Inability to form a complete sentence, even if they know the answer (especially for struggling/basic). They might just say "fairy" without "a" or "magical."
    *   Writing "faerie" or some other incorrect spelling if they are trying to write it on their own without seeing it.
    *   Not understanding the question at all due to limited English comprehension.
    *   Leaving it blank.

**Percentage breakdown:**

*   **struggling (35%): 0% full marks**
    *   These students will likely struggle to even understand the question fully. Even if they remember *something* about a fairy, articulating it correctly or even recalling the specific detail will be very difficult. Their reading comprehension and recall of specific details in English are extremely limited. They might write something completely irrelevant or nothing at all.
*   **basic (35%): 15% full marks**
    *   Some of these students might remember the "fairy" part if it was emphasized during the lesson and if they have a decent memory. However, many might only remember "fairy" and struggle with "a magical fairy." The expectation for a "full mark" answer ("a magical fairy") is quite high for this group. They might just write "fairy" which *would* be accepted, but the "magical" part is a differentiator. Let's assume a few will get the complete phrase or at least "fairy."
*   **competent (20%): 80% full marks**
    *   These students generally understand the question and can recall key details from stories they've read. If the story was covered well, most will remember the "magical fairy." They are also more likely to form the correct phrase. Some might miss "magical" but still get "fairy."
*   **advanced (10%): 100% full marks**
    *   These students have strong comprehension and recall. They would easily remember this detail and be able to articulate it correctly, including the adjective "magical." They are also generally good at following instructions and providing the specific answer requested.

**Final percentages:**

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 15% full marks
competent: 80% full marks
advanced: 100% full marks
