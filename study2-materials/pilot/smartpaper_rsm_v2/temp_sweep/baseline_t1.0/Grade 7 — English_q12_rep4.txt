Alright, let's break this down based on my experience in a Class 7 English classroom, keeping in mind the specific context.

**Understanding the Challenge for Each Group:**

*   **Language Barriers:** Many students, especially in the struggling and basic groups, will struggle with the vocabulary itself ("blew," "leaves," "away"). Reading the sentence itself might be a task.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This isn't just recall of a formula. It requires understanding the subject and object, the verb tense, and then applying the passive voice structure (object + 'to be' verb + past participle + by + subject). This is a multi-step reasoning process.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The answer is very specific. Any deviation in tense, form of the verb, or subject/object placement will lead to loss of marks.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Tense Errors:** Using "are blown" instead of "were blown."
    *   **Incorrect Past Participle:** "blowed" instead of "blown."
    *   **Omitting "by the wind":** While often optional in real-world use, for a direct transformation exercise, it's usually expected.
    *   **Confusing Subject/Object:** Reversing them incorrectly.
    *   **Simply rephrasing in active voice:** Not understanding the concept of passive voice at all.

**Percentage Predictions:**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   They will struggle to even read and comprehend the original sentence.
    *   The concept of active/passive voice will be completely alien or poorly grasped.
    *   Errors in verb form ("blowed"), tense ("are blowed"), and structure will be rampant.
    *   **struggling: 0% full marks** (They might write something, but it's highly unlikely to be correct. Even partial understanding would be rare.)

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   Some might understand the words, but the grammatical transformation is a leap.
    *   They might recognize that the 'object' comes first, but the correct verb form and tense will be a major hurdle.
    *   Common errors will be "The leaves are blown away by the wind" (tense error) or "The leaves was blown away by the wind" (agreement error).
    *   **basic: 5% full marks** (This 5% would be the very top end of the basic group who might have recently revised this topic and caught on to the pattern just enough.)

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   They generally understand the concept of active/passive voice and the need for past participle.
    *   They might still make a tense error (e.g., "are blown" instead of "were blown") if they're not careful about the original sentence's past tense.
    *   They understand the role of "by the wind."
    *   **competent: 60% full marks** (A significant portion will get it right, but a good 40% might slip up on the tense or a minor structural point.)

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   These students grasp grammatical concepts more readily.
    *   They are usually adept at identifying the tense and correctly forming the past participle.
    *   They would confidently apply the rule.
    *   **advanced: 90% full marks** (There's always a small chance of a silly mistake even with advanced students, but they would overwhelmingly succeed.)
