Here's my assessment based on my experience:

*   **Language Barrier:** The equation itself (`y + 9 = 4`) is very straightforward and uses universal mathematical symbols. The English instruction "Find the value of y in the equation" is also quite common and would likely be understood, or at least the core task of solving for 'y' would be inferred from the structure of the question. This isn't a major hurdle for most.

*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question primarily requires reasoning, specifically understanding the concept of balancing an equation and performing the inverse operation. While the *method* might be recalled (subtract 9 from both sides), the actual step of dealing with a positive number on the right side becoming a negative result is where the reasoning comes in.

*   **Specificity of Answer:** The answer `y = -5` is very specific. Any deviation (e.g., `y = 5`, `y = 13`, `y = -13`) would result in 0 marks.

*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **"Bade mein se chhote ko ghatao" (Subtract smaller from larger):** Many students, especially struggling and basic, will just subtract 4 from 9 and give `y = 5`. They often struggle with the concept of negative numbers arising from such subtractions when the smaller number is being subtracted from a larger one on the *same side* of the implied zero point, or when the result needs to be negative.
    *   **Adding instead of subtracting:** Some might mistakenly add 9 to 4, getting `y = 13`. This shows a lack of understanding of inverse operations.
    *   **Sign errors:** Even if they subtract correctly, they might forget the negative sign, resulting in `y = 5`.
    *   **Procedural errors:** Simply guessing or writing an answer without showing steps, which often indicates a lack of understanding.

Here's my percentage breakdown:

struggling: 0% full marks (They would almost certainly give `y = 5` or `y = 13`. The concept of negative results from such an equation is a major block for them.)
basic: 15% full marks (A small percentage might have grasped negative numbers and inverse operations, but many would still make the "9-4=5" mistake or other sign errors.)
competent: 80% full marks (Most would understand inverse operations and negative numbers. Occasional careless sign errors might occur.)
advanced: 100% full marks (This is a fundamental concept they would have mastered and understood thoroughly.)
