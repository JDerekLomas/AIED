Okay, let's break this down based on my experience in a Class 6 English classroom in an Indian government school, with students from similar backgrounds and ability levels.

The question is: Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket.

**Thinking Process:**

*   **Language barriers:** The sentence structure is relatively simple, but "some" and "any" are often confusing for Hindi-medium learners. They might try to directly translate, which doesn't always work for these quantifiers. The instructions "Choose the correct word" are also in English, but most students at this level would understand the intent through context or a quick Hindi explanation from me.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires recall of a grammatical rule (some for affirmative sentences, any for negative/interrogative). However, for the struggling and basic groups, it might feel more like a guess if they haven't explicitly learned or internalized this rule. For competent and advanced students, it's a straightforward recall.
*   **Specificity:** The answer is very specific: 'some'. There's no room for partial credit.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Confusing "some" and "any" because they both refer to an unspecified quantity.
    *   Over-generalizing the rule (e.g., using "any" in an affirmative sentence if they've only seen it in negative contexts recently).
    *   Simply guessing because they don't understand the difference.
    *   For the struggling students, even reading the words "some" and "any" might be a challenge, let alone distinguishing their usage.

**Percentage of students who would score full marks:**

*   **Struggling (35%):** These students often struggle with basic sight words and simple sentence structures. The rule for "some/any" is usually introduced and reinforced, but for them, it's often a rote memorization task that they forget quickly, or they simply haven't grasped the core concept. They are more likely to guess or choose randomly.
    *   **struggling: 10% full marks** (This accounts for a few who might have recently revised it, or made a lucky guess, or understood it better than their usual performance suggests on this specific item).

*   **Basic (35%):** These students have a foundational understanding but often make errors with grammatical nuances. They might recall the rule but apply it incorrectly, or waver between "some" and "any." They've likely been taught this rule, but consistent application is still a challenge.
    *   **basic: 40% full marks** (A good portion would get it right due to recent teaching, but many would still get confused or make a common error).

*   **Competent (20%):** These students generally understand grammatical rules and can apply them in simple sentences. This rule is quite fundamental, and they would likely have internalized it.
    *   **competent: 85% full marks** (Most would get this, with a small margin for a silly mistake or momentary confusion).

*   **Advanced (10%):** These students have a strong grasp of English grammar for their age and often read outside of school. This question would be very straightforward for them.
    *   **advanced: 100% full marks** (They would confidently choose "some").
