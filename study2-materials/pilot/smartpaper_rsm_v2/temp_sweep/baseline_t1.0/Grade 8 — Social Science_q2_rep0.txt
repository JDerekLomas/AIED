This is a great question that highlights the challenges and nuances of teaching in a government school setting, especially with the specified student demographic.

Here's my breakdown of expected scores, keeping in mind the factors mentioned:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Many struggling students would have difficulty even understanding the question, let alone formulating an answer in English. "Key feature," "urban planning," "Harappan Civilization" are all complex terms for them.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is primarily a recall question. While we would have taught it, their memory recall for specific details, especially when presented in an unfamiliar language context, is often weak.
*   **Specificity:** The answer needs to be specific. "Houses" or "walls" won't cut it. They need to mention the *planning* aspect.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might remember "Harappa" but confuse it with another ancient civilization or recall a general fact not related to urban planning (e.g., "they grew wheat"). Many would leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant. The 5% would be those who have a strong visual memory from classroom activities or picked up a key phrase like "drainage system" and managed to connect it.

**basic: 30% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They would likely understand the gist of the question ("Harappa," "city," "what was special?"), but might struggle with precise terminology.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They have a better chance of recalling specific facts if taught well, but they might struggle to select the *most appropriate* "key feature."
*   **Specificity:** They might get close. For example, they might say "good roads" instead of "grid pattern of streets," or "water pipes" instead of "advanced drainage system." This might get partial credit in a real exam but not full marks here.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Stating general facts that aren't *key features of urban planning* (e.g., "they traded"). Some might correctly identify one feature but struggle to articulate it clearly in English. The 30% are those who can recall a distinct feature like the drainage system or the grid layout and express it, even if simply.

**competent: 75% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They would mostly understand the question and be able to articulate a coherent answer.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They have a good grasp of the subject matter and can recall specific details.
*   **Specificity:** They are more likely to provide a precise answer like "well-planned grid layout of streets" or "advanced drainage system."
*   **Common Mistakes:** A small percentage might misremember a detail or choose a less impactful feature. They might also sometimes make grammatical errors that don't obscure the meaning but might make the answer less 'polished'. The 75% assumes they've absorbed the core points and can express them.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here. They'll understand the question perfectly.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Excellent recall. They've likely made connections between different features of Harappan urban planning.
*   **Specificity:** They would easily identify and articulate a precise key feature. They might even be able to offer more than one, demonstrating their strong understanding.
*   **Common Mistakes:** The 5% who might not get full marks would be due to a rare lapse of memory, momentary confusion, or perhaps choosing a feature that, while correct, is not considered "key" enough by the strict rubric, though this is less likely for this particular question.

This distribution reflects the significant impact of language proficiency and memory recall on objective, specific recall questions in this educational environment.
