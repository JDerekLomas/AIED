Namaste, Bachon! (Hello, children!)

This is a good question for our Class 6 students, as it connects directly to our state, Rajasthan.

Let's break down how my students would likely perform.

**Scoring Rubric Analysis:**
*   Mentions two correct natural resources.
*   Explains how one influences lives.

**Thinking Process for Each Group:**

*   **Language Barriers:** This is a major hurdle. "Natural resources," "influences," and "lives" are vocabulary many struggling students won't grasp easily in English. They might know the Hindi equivalent (प्राकृतिक संसाधन, प्रभाव डालना, जीवन).
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:**
    *   **Recall:** Listing natural resources of Rajasthan is recall. We've likely discussed this in class, possibly even in Hindi first. Marble, sand, copper, gypsum, water (though scarce) are common.
    *   **Reasoning:** Explaining *how* it influences lives requires a basic cause-and-effect understanding. For example, "Marble is used for buildings," or "Water helps us grow crops."
*   **Specificity:** "Two correct natural resources" is specific. The explanation needs to be relevant to the chosen resource.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Listing only one resource.
    *   Listing resources not found in Rajasthan (e.g., coal, tea).
    *   Not explaining the influence clearly, or just stating "it is important" without details.
    *   Struggling to articulate the explanation in English. They might know the answer in Hindi but can't frame it in English.
    *   Confusing "natural resources" with "man-made things."
    *   Missing the "how it influences" part entirely.

Let's consider the breakdown:

**struggling: 0-5% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** The language is a huge barrier here. Many wouldn't even understand "natural resources" or "influences" in English. Even if they recall one or two resources (like "paani" for water, or "patthar" for stone/marble), articulating the influence in English would be near impossible. They might write a few random words or leave it blank. A very small percentage might understand enough key terms from class discussions (if I've repeated them in Hindi) and manage a very simple, broken sentence for the explanation.

**basic: 15-25% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** These students might recognize "natural resources" from keywords or repeated class discussions, especially if I've provided Hindi equivalents. They could likely recall one or two common resources like "water," "marble," or "sand." However, the explanation part is where they will struggle. They might give a very simplistic, incomplete explanation ("Water is for drinking," "Marble is used for homes") but might not fully elaborate on the "influence on lives." Some might struggle with the grammar and vocabulary to form a complete, coherent sentence in English. Many would get 1/2 marks for listing resources, but lose marks on the explanation.

**competent: 60-75% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** These students generally understand the question's core meaning, even with some unfamiliar English words, because they can connect it to our lessons. They can easily list two resources (e.g., Marble, Copper, Water). They would be able to construct a reasonably clear explanation for one resource, for example: "Marble is found in Rajasthan. It influences people's lives because it is used to build houses and temples, providing jobs for many workers." They might make minor grammatical errors but the meaning would be clear.

**advanced: 90-100% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** These students would have no trouble understanding the question's language or concepts. They would easily recall two resources (and perhaps even more). Their explanation would be clear, concise, and well-structured, demonstrating a good understanding of cause and effect. They might even include a slight detail like "Marble is exported, bringing money to the state." They would likely aim for perfect grammar and vocabulary.

**Final Percentage Breakdown:**

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 20% full marks
competent: 70% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
