As an experienced teacher in this setting, here's my breakdown of how my students would likely perform on that question, along with my reasoning:

**Context for my thinking:**

*   **"Describes the poet's writing style."** This is a *reasoning* question, not direct recall, which is immediately a hurdle for many. It requires understanding the poem, abstracting its *manner* of writing, and then selecting an appropriate descriptive word.
*   **"Suitable and relevant word."** This implies a range of acceptable answers, which is good, but finding *any* suitable word when you struggle with the poem's content is hard.
*   **Language Barrier:** The biggest hurdle. Even if a student grasps the *concept* of the poem, articulating "writing style" and finding a suitable English adjective is very difficult. Many will not even understand "writing style" itself.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Confusing style with content:** Describing *what* the poet writes about (e.g., "sad," "about nature") instead of *how* they write it.
    *   **Lack of vocabulary:** Understanding the concept but not having the English word (e.g., they know it's easy to understand but don't know "simple" or "lucid").
    *   **Guessing:** Picking a random adjective they know.
    *   **Leaving blank:** If they don't understand the question or how to answer it.
    *   **Translating literally from Hindi:** This rarely works for abstract concepts like "writing style."

Here's my percentage breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   They will almost certainly not understand "writing style" or "poet's." Even if they understood a few words of the poem, abstracting the *style* is beyond them. They might write something about the poem's theme if they catch a word or two, but not its style.

**basic: 5% full marks**
*   A very small fraction might grasp "writing style" as "how the poet writes." They might pick up on a very obvious characteristic like "simple" if the language of the poem was exceptionally straightforward. However, the vocabulary to describe it is still a major hurdle. They are more likely to describe the *mood* or *topic* of the poem rather than the *style*. Many will still confuse "style" with "content."

**competent: 40% full marks**
*   These students will understand "writing style" and "poet." They will be able to read and generally comprehend the poem. They will likely be able to identify a characteristic like "simple," "descriptive," or "direct" if the poem lends itself to it. Their challenge might be choosing the *best* word or having enough vocabulary, but they stand a good chance. They are more likely to have encountered this type of question or concept before.

**advanced: 80% full marks**
*   These students will fully understand the question and the poem. They have the vocabulary and analytical skills to pick an appropriate and relevant word. They are more likely to consider several options before settling on one, and their answers will often be more nuanced (e.g., "evocative," "narrative," "colloquial" if appropriate). The 20% that miss out might just pick a less precise word that still fits the rubric, or perhaps misinterpret a very subtle aspect of the poem's style, but they'd largely succeed.
