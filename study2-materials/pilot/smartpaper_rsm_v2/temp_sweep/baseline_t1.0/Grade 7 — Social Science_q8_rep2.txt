Here's my breakdown based on my experience:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** These students would struggle significantly to even read and comprehend the question in English. Even if they knew the answer in Hindi, translating it and writing it down would be a major hurdle.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** This question requires direct recall. Their knowledge base might be very limited due to sporadic attendance, lack of exposure, and difficulty grasping concepts taught in class.
* **Common mistakes:** Blank answers, completely irrelevant answers, or just copying words from the question.

**basic: 15% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They might be able to read the question with some difficulty, perhaps needing a little help with a word or two. They might understand the gist.
* **Recall:** They might recall *one* major occupation, likely agriculture, as it's the most common and widely discussed. Getting two correct and spelled reasonably well would be a challenge.
* **Common mistakes:** Naming only one occupation, misspelling, or providing very vague answers. They might get partial credit for one correct answer, but full marks for two and a brief description would be tough.

**competent: 70% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They would generally understand the question without much issue.
* **Recall:** They are likely to recall at least two main occupations (Agriculture and Animal Husbandry are very prominent in Rajasthan and would have been covered). They might also recall handicrafts.
* **Specificity:** They would be able to briefly describe one, likely agriculture, as it's the easiest to explain.
* **Common mistakes:** Minor spelling errors, or a description that's a bit too short, but generally hitting the mark for full credit.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issues at all.
* **Recall:** They would easily recall multiple occupations and describe one clearly and concisely.
* **Specificity:** Their descriptions would be articulate and accurate. They might even offer more than what's strictly required, showcasing a deeper understanding.
* **Common mistakes:** Extremely rare, perhaps a very minor grammatical error that doesn't hinder understanding.

**Summary:**

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 15% full marks
competent: 70% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
