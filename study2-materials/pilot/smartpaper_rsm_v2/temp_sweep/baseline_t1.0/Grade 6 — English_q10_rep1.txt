This is a common grammar point, but with the specific context of a Class 6 Indian government school in an economically weaker section, the performance will vary significantly.

Here's my breakdown:

*   **Language barriers:** Many struggling and even some basic students will have difficulty simply *reading* and *understanding* the question and the options, let alone knowing the rule. They might guess based on familiarity with one word or the other.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This item primarily requires recall of a grammar rule, not deep reasoning. However, for those who haven't been taught it explicitly or reinforced, it becomes a guessing game.
*   **Specificity:** The answer is very specific. There's only one correct choice.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Using 'any' in affirmative sentences, especially if they hear it in other contexts (e.g., "Are there any apples?").
    *   Confusing 'some' and 'any' due to general lack of exposure and practice.
    *   Simply not knowing the rule at all.
    *   Choosing 'any' because it's a shorter word, or just a random guess.

Based on this, here's my estimate:

struggling: 10% full marks (likely due to a lucky guess or someone helping them)
basic: 30% full marks (some might have a vague idea or recall from a recent lesson, but many will struggle)
competent: 75% full marks (they would have been taught this and have a reasonable recall, though some might make a careless error or momentary confusion)
advanced: 95% full marks (they would almost certainly know this rule and apply it correctly)
