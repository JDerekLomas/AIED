Here's my breakdown based on experience:

The question asks for an **adjective phrase**, but the scoring rubric indicates that identifying "tiny" as an **adjective** would earn full marks. This discrepancy is important. If the expectation truly is to identify *just* the adjective "tiny," then the percentages will be higher than if they had to identify an *adjective phrase*. Since the rubric explicitly mentions "tiny" as an adjective, I will assume that is the expected full mark answer.

**Thinking process:**

*   **Language barriers:** Many struggling students would have difficulty even understanding the term "adjective phrase" or even "adjective" if not recently taught and reinforced in Hindi. The sentence itself is relatively simple, but the grammatical terminology is the hurdle.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** Identifying "tiny" is mostly recall (what describes a noun?). Identifying an "adjective phrase" requires more nuanced reasoning and understanding of multi-word modifiers. Given the rubric, it's leaning towards recall of "adjective."
*   **Specificity of answer:** "Tiny" is very specific. If they were looking for an *adjective phrase*, it would be "A tiny" (modifying "bird") or potentially "in our balcony" (modifying "nest" if we stretch it, but that's more prepositional/adverbial usually). The rubric simplifies this significantly.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Confusing adjective with verb or noun, especially for struggling students.
    *   Not understanding "adjective" or "phrase" at all.
    *   Identifying the entire sentence or just "bird" or "nest."
    *   If they actually tried to find a *phrase*, they might incorrectly pick "in our balcony" (thinking it describes the location, which it does, but it's not an *adjective phrase*).

**Assuming the rubric means identifying "tiny" as the adjective (not an adjective *phrase*):**

struggling: 10% full marks (A few might recall "describing word" from Hindi explanations, or guess based on the simplicity of "tiny").
basic: 40% full marks (They've likely been introduced to adjectives, might recognize "tiny" as a describing word, but the terminology "adjective" might still be a bit shaky).
competent: 85% full marks (They should be able to identify "tiny" as an adjective with good confidence).
advanced: 95% full marks (They will easily identify "tiny" as an adjective. The only potential pitfall would be if they were *overthinking* and trying to find a *phrase* as per the question, and then getting confused when there isn't an obvious multi-word adjective phrase).
