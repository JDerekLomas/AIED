This is a great question that makes me think deeply about my students' understanding. Here's my breakdown:

**Overall Assessment:**
The question requires recall of a specific historical event and understanding its direct consequence, rather than complex reasoning. However, the language "contribute to the expansion of British power" might be a slight hurdle for some. The core idea is "British control over Bengal" and "puppet nawab."

**Common Mistakes & Challenges:**

*   **Language Barrier:** Many struggling and basic students will struggle to even *read* the question accurately. "Contribute to the expansion" can be a mouthful. They might pick out "Battle of Plassey 1757" and "British power" but miss the nuance of "expansion" and "contribute."
*   **Recall Difficulty:** While it's a key event, some students, especially those struggling, might confuse the *outcome* with other battles or general British tactics. They might remember "British won" but not the *specific consequence* for Bengal.
*   **Specificity:** The rubric requires "political dominance/control over Bengal" or "puppet nawab." A general answer like "British became powerful" or "British got a lot of money" might not get full marks, even if partly true.
*   **Focus on Mir Jafar:** For students who have grasped this, linking it to Mir Jafar as a puppet is a strong indicator of understanding.
*   **Syllabus Coverage:** We cover this extensively, often using stories, visual aids (maps, pictures of Clive and Mir Jafar), and simplified Hindi explanations. We emphasize the "how did they get control" aspect.

Here's my prediction for full marks:

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   Many will struggle to understand the question itself.
    *   Some might write "British won" or "British became strong."
    *   Very few will pinpoint "control over Bengal" or "puppet nawab."
    *   **Prediction: 5% full marks** (These would be the ones who've managed to internalize this specific fact through repeated exposure and perhaps some home support).

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   They'll likely understand the question's intent.
    *   Many will recall that the British won and became powerful *in that region*.
    *   Some might mention "control over Bengal" but might not articulate the "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" part clearly enough for full marks according to the strict rubric.
    *   **Prediction: 25% full marks** (They'll get close, but often miss the specific articulation of "political dominance" or "Mir Jafar as puppet").

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   They understand the question well.
    *   They can recall the event and its significance.
    *   They should be able to articulate that the victory led to British political control over Bengal, or the installation of Mir Jafar as a puppet ruler, which aligns perfectly with the rubric.
    *   **Prediction: 80% full marks** (A few might still use slightly less precise language, but the core idea will be there).

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   They will understand the question thoroughly and have a strong grasp of the topic.
    *   They will articulate the answer clearly and concisely, meeting all the requirements of the rubric, likely mentioning both political dominance and the puppet nawab.
    *   **Prediction: 95% full marks** (A rare moment of misinterpretation or a slight lapse in memory might prevent 100%).
