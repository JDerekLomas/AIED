This is a common type of question in Class 8, and while the concept of negative numbers might be new to some struggling students, others would have encountered it. The language is simple, and it's more about recall and basic application than complex reasoning.

Here's my breakdown based on experience:

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** These students often struggle with the concept of negative numbers, especially when it involves "crossing" the zero. They might try to subtract 4 from 9, or simply get confused by the subtraction. The English is simple enough not to be the main barrier here, but the mathematical operation of `4 - 9` is the challenge.
    *   **Common mistakes:** `y = 5` (subtracting 4 from 9), `y = 13` (adding), or simply leaving it blank.
    *   **Prediction:** 10% full marks

*   **Basic (35% of class):** These students have been introduced to negative numbers and usually grasp the concept of transposing terms (moving +9 to the other side as -9). They might do it mentally or write `y = 4 - 9`. The key is whether they can accurately perform `4 - 9`.
    *   **Common mistakes:** Still some may make the `y = 5` mistake if they're not careful with signs, or get confused if they try to do it mentally and aren't solid on number line understanding.
    *   **Prediction:** 50% full marks

*   **Competent (20% of class):** These students are generally comfortable with basic algebraic manipulation and operations involving integers. They would likely solve this quickly and accurately.
    *   **Prediction:** 90% full marks

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** This question is very straightforward for them. They would solve it without any difficulty.
    *   **Prediction:** 100% full marks
