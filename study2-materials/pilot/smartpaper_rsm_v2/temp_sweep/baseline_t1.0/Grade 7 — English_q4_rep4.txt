Here's my breakdown of how my Class 7 English students would likely perform on that question, keeping in mind their background and abilities:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Many wouldn't even be able to fully comprehend the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?" They would struggle with "important," "real life," and linking it to "king's questions."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires reasoning and opinion, which is a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall. Even if they recall the king's questions, they can't connect it to real life.
*   **Specificity:** Providing "one reason" is also a challenge. They might just say "yes" or "no" without any justification.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Misinterpreting the question, giving a one-word answer, or simply repeating a phrase from the text without understanding.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They might understand the general gist of the question, but linking "king's questions" to their own "real life" might still be difficult. They would understand "important" but struggle to articulate *why*.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall the king's questions (right time, right people, right thing) but making the leap to their relevance in everyday life is a hurdle.
*   **Specificity:** Some might manage a very simple reason, like "because it helps us" but without much elaboration.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Giving a vague reason, using incorrect grammar, or struggling to form a coherent sentence. A few might get a point for "yes, because it helps us to do things better" if I'm very generous with the "any valid reason."

**competent: 60% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They would understand the question fully.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall the king's questions and connect them to real-life scenarios. They've likely discussed the themes of the story in class.
*   **Specificity:** They would be able to give a valid reason, even if simple. Examples: "Yes, because knowing the right time helps us succeed," or "Yes, because we always need to know what to do."
*   **Common Mistakes:** Some might provide a slightly weak or general reason, or struggle with perfect sentence structure, but the core idea would be there.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They not only recall the questions but have likely internalized the lesson's message. They can easily articulate the relevance.
*   **Specificity:** They would confidently provide a clear, valid, and well-articulated reason. Examples: "Yes, because in real life, making the right decisions about timing, actions, and who to trust is crucial for success and avoiding problems," or "These questions teach us to be mindful and responsible in our daily lives, which is very important."
*   **Common Mistakes:** A rare grammatical error, but the substance of their answer would be spot on. The 10% not getting full marks might be due to a very minor slip or a slightly less convincing "reason."
