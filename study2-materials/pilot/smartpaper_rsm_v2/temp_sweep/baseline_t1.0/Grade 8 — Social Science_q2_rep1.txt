This is a great question that highlights the challenges we face in government schools with diverse learning needs and language barriers. Let's break down how my Class 8 Social Science students would likely perform on this specific question.

**Thinking process for the student groups:**

*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they know the answer in Hindi, translating it into coherent English is tough. Many will struggle to *understand* the question itself, let alone formulate an answer.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is primarily a recall question. They either remember the feature or they don't. There's not much scope for reasoning or deduction here.
*   **Specificity:** The required answer is quite specific. "Good planning" isn't enough; they need to mention *what kind* of planning (grid, drainage, bricks, city division).
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Misunderstanding "urban planning." They might just say "Harappa was a city."
    *   Providing a vague answer: "They had good cities."
    *   Mixing up features with other civilizations.
    *   Inability to express the correct feature in English, even if they know it in Hindi.
    *   Focusing on non-urban planning aspects like seals or crafts.
    *   Simply copying parts of the question or unrelated words they remember.

Here's my breakdown of expected full marks:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*Reasoning:* These students will struggle to even comprehend the question due to language. Even if they've heard about Harappa, recalling a *specific* feature of its *urban planning* and expressing it in English is beyond them. They might write something completely irrelevant or just leave it blank.

**basic:** 10% full marks
*Reasoning:* These students might understand the gist of the question ("Harappa city planning"). They might remember a key term like "drainage system" or "baked bricks" if we've drilled it extensively and I've provided the English term. However, their sentence structure might be broken, or they might only give a single word. Only a small fraction will manage a coherent, correct sentence. Many will give vague answers like "clean cities" or "strong houses."

**competent:** 60% full marks
*Reasoning:* These students have a decent grasp of English and usually pay attention in class. If we've covered Harappan civilization thoroughly, they would likely recall one of the major features like the grid pattern, drainage, or baked bricks. They might struggle a bit with perfect sentence formation, but they would get the core idea across in a way that deserves a full mark. They are more likely to attempt a specific answer.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*Reasoning:* These students typically understand the question clearly, even with complex vocabulary. They will have a good recall of the topic and can articulate a specific feature in clear, concise English. They often remember multiple features and will pick one that best fits. The 5% not getting full marks might be due to a momentary lapse in memory, or perhaps focusing on an obscure feature that isn't considered "key," but it's rare.
