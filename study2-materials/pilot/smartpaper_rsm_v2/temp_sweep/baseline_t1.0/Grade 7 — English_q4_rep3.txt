This is a great question to gauge both comprehension and critical thinking, but in a Class 7 Indian government school with the described student demographic, the language barrier and the need for reasoning will significantly impact scores.

Let's break down the question and the rubric:

**The Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."
**The King's Questions (implied from passage):** What is the right time to begin everything? Who are the right people to listen to? What is the most important thing to do? (Though the rubric simplifies to: right time, right thing, right people).
**Scoring Rubric:** Any valid reason. Max score: 1.

**Analysis of the task for students:**

1.  **Recall/Comprehension:** Students first need to understand *what* the king's questions were, even if not explicitly stated in this prompt. This means remembering the core theme of the story "The Three Questions."
2.  **Vocabulary/Sentence Structure:** "Important in real life" requires understanding "important" and "real life." The question itself is simple in structure, which is good.
3.  **Reasoning/Application:** This is the crucial part. Students need to connect the king's philosophical quest to their own understanding of "real life" and articulate *why* it's important. This moves beyond simple recall.
4.  **Language Production:** Students need to form a coherent sentence or two to give a reason. This is where many will struggle, even if they grasp the concept.

**Common Mistakes Students Might Make:**

*   **Not understanding "important in real life":** They might just recall the story details without connecting it to the prompt.
*   **Struggling with "give one reason":** Even if they think it's important, articulating *why* in English can be tough. They might give a very vague answer or just repeat "because it is important."
*   **Literal interpretation:** Some might struggle with the abstract nature of the questions and think only of practical, immediate things.
*   **Grammar and vocabulary errors:** Even if they have a good idea, expressing it clearly might be an issue.
*   **Lack of confidence:** Students, especially those struggling, might be hesitant to even try if they feel their English isn't perfect.

Given these considerations, here's my breakdown of expected full marks:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*Reasoning:* These students will likely struggle with both understanding the question fully (especially "important in real life" beyond a literal sense) and formulating a coherent reason in English. They might be able to recall the king asked questions but won't be able to connect it meaningfully or articulate a 'why'.

**basic:** 10% full marks
*Reasoning:* These students might grasp the *idea* that the questions are about making good decisions, but articulating a *valid reason* in clear English will be challenging. They might say something like "Yes, because we need to know what to do," which is very basic and might or might not fully meet the "valid reason" criteria depending on strictness. The 10% would be for those who manage a slightly better-formulated, even if simple, reason like "Yes, because it helps us live a good life."

**competent:** 60% full marks
*Reasoning:* These students will understand the prompt and the essence of the king's questions. Many will be able to formulate a valid reason, even if it's a simple one, in reasonably correct English. For example: "Yes, because knowing the right time and the right people helps us make good decisions." or "Yes, because these questions help us live a successful life." They might not give the most profound answer, but it will be valid.

**advanced:** 90% full marks
*Reasoning:* These students will not only understand the question and its philosophical underpinnings but also be able to articulate a clear, well-reasoned answer with good sentence structure. They might elaborate slightly more or use more appropriate vocabulary. They might say something like: "Yes, because understanding the right time, the right people, and the right action is fundamental for effective decision-making and leading a purposeful life." The 10% not scoring full marks might be due to a minor grammatical error or a slightly less convincing reason, or simply misinterpreting "valid reason" in a very specific way.
