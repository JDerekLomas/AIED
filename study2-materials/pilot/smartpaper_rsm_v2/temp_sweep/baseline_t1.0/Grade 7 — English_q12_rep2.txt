This is a very common type of question in Class 7, and while it might seem straightforward, the various challenges faced by students in a government school context make it trickier than it appears.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling:** **0% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They likely wouldn't understand "Active Voice" or "Passive Voice" as concepts, even if translated. The sentence itself might be challenging to read and comprehend ("blew," "away").
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires a foundational understanding of sentence structure and verb forms that they lack. They can't reason it out if they don't know the rules.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Even if they recognize "the leaves" as the object, they wouldn't know to use "were blown." They might just rearrange words randomly or change the verb tense incorrectly. "The leaves blow by the wind" or "Wind leaves blown" would be common attempts.

**basic:** **10% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Some might be able to read and understand the sentence "The wind blew the leaves away." The terms "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" are likely still a hurdle, but they might recall *examples* from prior teaching rather than the rules.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might have memorized a few common passive constructions, but applying it to a new sentence is difficult. They primarily rely on recall.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might correctly identify "The leaves" as the start, but struggle with "were blown." Common errors would be "The leaves was blown away by the wind" (subject-verb agreement), "The leaves blew away by the wind" (incorrect verb form), or forgetting "by the wind."

**competent:** **60% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They can read and understand the instruction and the sentence. They would have been taught the basic rules of active/passive voice.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would attempt to apply the rules they've learned, identifying the subject, verb, and object, and then reconstructing the sentence. They are using both recall of rules and a degree of reasoning.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Their mistakes would be more subtle: "The leaves were blowed away by the wind" (incorrect past participle of irregular verb), or occasionally forgetting "by the wind," or getting the tense slightly wrong if they overthink it. Most would get it right.

**advanced:** **95% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issue here.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would easily recall the rules for active to passive transformation, identify the components, and correctly form the passive sentence. This is a standard grammatical transformation for them.
*   **Common Mistakes:** A rare careless error, perhaps. Otherwise, they would get this correct without much difficulty. The irregular verb "blew/blown" is something they are likely familiar with.
