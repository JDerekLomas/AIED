Okay, reflecting on my Class 6 English students in a government school, especially with their diverse backgrounds and proficiency levels, here's my breakdown for the sentence rearrangement "book/reading/a/is/he":

struggling: **0-5%** full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Many would struggle just to read and understand all the individual words, let alone their meaning in a sentence. They might identify 'he' and 'book' but connecting 'reading' and 'is' in the correct order for a verb phrase would be very challenging.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires some basic grammatical reasoning (understanding subject-verb-object) which is a higher-order skill for them. They likely haven't explicitly learned sentence structure in English in a way that translates easily to this task.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might just write the words as they appear, or try to put 'book' first because it's a familiar noun. They lack the foundational understanding to apply SVO structure.

basic: **20-30%** full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Most of them would be able to read and understand the individual words. They might even recognize 'he' as a person and 'book' as an object.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might have encountered simple sentences like "He is a boy" or "She is reading" but putting it all together in the correct SVO format with a continuous verb ("is reading") might still be tricky. They'd need to reason a bit.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might struggle with the 'is reading' part, perhaps writing "He reading is a book" or "He a book is reading." The auxiliary verb and main verb order can be confusing. Some might try "A book he is reading."

competent: **70-80%** full marks
*   **Language barriers:** No issue reading or understanding the words.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would generally have a good grasp of basic English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object). They've seen and used sentences like this before, so it's more of a recall and application task rather than pure reasoning from scratch.
*   **Common mistakes:** A few might still make a minor error like forgetting the capital 'H' or a full stop, but the core word order would likely be correct.

advanced: **95-100%** full marks
*   **Language barriers:** No issue whatsoever.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is a straightforward task for them. They understand sentence structure well and can easily identify the subject, verb phrase, and object. It's a basic application of their existing knowledge.
*   **Common mistakes:** Extremely rare, perhaps a slip of the pen or an oversight of punctuation, but the word order would be accurate.
