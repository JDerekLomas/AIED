This is a straightforward recall question that we've likely covered multiple times in class, probably using maps and local examples where possible. The biggest hurdle will be the English language for some.

Here's my breakdown:

*   **struggling: 10% full marks**
    *   Many of these students will struggle to even read "mountain ranges" in English. They might recognize "India" and "mountain" but not connect it to the need for two *names*. If they manage to grasp it, they might recall "Himalaya" as it's the most prominent. However, getting two correct names, especially with the English spelling, will be very hard for them.
*   **basic: 40% full marks**
    *   These students will likely understand the question after a bit of thought or if they recognize keywords. They will almost certainly recall "Himalayas." For the second, they might recall Aravalli, Vindhya, or Satpura, which are often discussed in relation to different parts of India. Spelling might be an issue, but since it's "name any two," a recognizable phonetic spelling would likely get them partial credit, and full credit if one is perfect.
*   **competent: 85% full marks**
    *   These students will read and understand the question easily. They will definitely know the Himalayas. They will also likely know a second major range like Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, or the Western/Eastern Ghats. Their spelling will generally be accurate enough to secure full marks.
*   **advanced: 95% full marks**
    *   These students will find this question very easy. They will recall multiple mountain ranges and likely spell them correctly without any problem. The only reason it's not 100% is the rare chance of a silly mistake or misunderstanding of "major" leading them to pick something less prominent, but that's highly unlikely given the simplicity of the question.
