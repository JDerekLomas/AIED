This is a great question that really makes me think about my students!

Here's my breakdown, keeping in mind the specific rubric and my students' typical performance:

*   **struggling:** 0% full marks
    *   *Reasoning:* These students often struggle to even read the question "Define fable." Even if they recognize the word "fable" from a story we've read, they wouldn't be able to articulate a definition in English, especially one that includes both "animals as characters" and "moral lesson." Their vocabulary is very limited. They might write a single word like "story" or just leave it blank.

*   **basic:** 5% full marks
    *   *Reasoning:* While they might understand the concept of a fable if we've discussed it extensively in class, putting it into a coherent English sentence that captures all the required elements (short story, animals, moral) would be very challenging. They might remember "story" and "animals," or "story" and "moral," but rarely all three. Their sentence construction skills are weak. They might write something like "Fable is animal story" or "Fable teaches us good thing."

*   **competent:** 40% full marks
    *   *Reasoning:* These students have a better grasp of English and might have a good understanding of what a fable is. They've likely read a few and we've discussed the concept. They would probably remember the key elements: animals and a moral. They might produce a sentence like, "A fable is a short story with animals that teaches a lesson." They might miss the "typically" or "imparts" for "teaches," but would get the core ideas. Some might still struggle to combine all three precisely as per the rubric.

*   **advanced:** 85% full marks
    *   *Reasoning:* These students are generally strong in English and would have a clear understanding of the definition. They would likely recall the essential components and be able to articulate them in a grammatically correct sentence close to the rubric's expectation. They might not use "imparts" but would use a suitable synonym like "teaches" or "gives." The precision of "short story," "animals as characters," and "moral lesson" would likely be there. The remaining 15% might make a minor error in phrasing or forget one small element.
