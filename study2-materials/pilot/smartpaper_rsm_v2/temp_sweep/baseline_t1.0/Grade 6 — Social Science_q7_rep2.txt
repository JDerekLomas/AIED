Namaste bachchon! Kaise ho sab? Aaj hum Rajasthan ke baare mein kuch khaas baatein karenge.

**Question:** Rajasthan mein paaye jaane wale koi bhi do prakritik sansadhan (natural resources) batao aur unmein se kisi ek ka logon ke jeevan par kya asar hota hai, woh samjhao.

**(In simple Hindi):** Rajasthan mein milne wali do cheezein batao jo prakriti ne humein di hain (jaise pani, patthar, ya khanij). Phir unmein se kisi ek cheez ka logon ki zindagi par kya asar padta hai, woh samjhao.

**Based on my experience with Class 6 students in an Indian government school, here's my assessment:**

*   **Language barriers:** The biggest hurdle will be the English instruction. Even if they know the answer in Hindi, translating it to correct English terms for "natural resources" (prakritik sansadhan), "influences" (asar), etc., will be tough for many. I'd likely provide the question in both English and simple Hindi to ensure comprehension.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** Naming two resources is primarily recall, which some will manage if we've covered it in class. Explaining the influence requires a bit of basic reasoning/understanding of cause and effect, which is harder.
*   **Specificity:** Naming two resources is quite specific. Explaining the influence needs a relevant and clear connection.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Naming resources that are not "natural" (e.g., forts, camels, which are cultural/animal wealth, not natural resources in the geographical sense).
    *   Naming only one resource.
    *   Not explaining the influence clearly or making a vague statement.
    *   Spelling mistakes making words unintelligible.
    *   Focusing on just the economic aspect, not broader life aspects (e.g., for water: agriculture, daily life, scarcity issues).
    *   Writing the answer fully in Hindi despite the English question (if not given Hindi option).

Here's my estimated percentage of students scoring full marks:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*(They might name one resource like 'water' or 'sand' but struggle with the second, or fail to explain the influence in coherent English. Some might get lucky if they recall a very simple phrase.)*

**basic:** 25% full marks
*(They will likely name two common resources like 'water' and 'marble/sand'. They might attempt to explain the influence, perhaps picking 'water' and mentioning farming or scarcity, but the English might be grammatically weak or incomplete. They'll get partial credit for clarity, but full marks will be challenging due to language and structured explanation.)*

**competent:** 60% full marks
*(They can name two correct resources. They will be able to explain the influence of one resource fairly well, for example, linking water to agriculture, daily life, or scarcity, or marble/sandstone to construction and livelihoods. Their English will be understandable, though not necessarily perfect.)*

**advanced:** 90% full marks
*(They will easily identify two natural resources (e.g., water, copper, marble, sunlight). They will provide a clear, concise, and accurate explanation of how one resource influences life, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, even if it's simple English. They might give examples for clarity.)*
