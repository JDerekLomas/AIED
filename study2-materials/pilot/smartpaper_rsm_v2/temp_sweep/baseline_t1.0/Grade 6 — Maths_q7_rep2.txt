Okay, let's break down this problem from my perspective in the classroom.

**Language Barriers:** This is a big one. "Temperature," "increases by," "per hour," "elapsed" (even if not explicitly asked, it's implied in the rubric) – these are all terms that many of my Hindi-medium students will struggle with. They might pick up on "30 C" and "2 C per hour" and "4:00 evening" but connecting it all into a coherent understanding of the problem is tough. "10 am" to "4 pm" in English is also a potential hurdle; they might count hours starting from 1 rather than thinking of it as 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4.

**Recall vs. Reasoning:** This problem primarily requires *reasoning* and a sequential understanding of time and addition/multiplication. It's not a direct recall of a formula. They need to:
1.  Understand the starting time and temperature.
2.  Understand the ending time.
3.  Calculate the duration between the two times.
4.  Understand the rate of increase.
5.  Apply the rate to the duration to find the total increase.
6.  Add the total increase to the initial temperature.

The rubric specifically focuses on step 3: "Calculates the time elapsed from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm as 6 hours." This is *the critical first step* in the reasoning process for this problem, and it's where many will stumble even before getting to the multiplication.

**Specific Answer:** The rubric is very specific about *how* to get the 1 mark – calculating the time elapsed. It doesn't even mention the final temperature.

**Common Mistakes:**
*   **Time Calculation:**
    *   Counting 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 as 7 hours.
    *   Getting confused between am/pm, especially crossing noon.
    *   Just subtracting 10 from 4 (4-10 = -6 or misunderstanding this).
    *   Only counting 1, 2, 3, 4 as 4 hours.
*   **Misinterpreting "per hour":** Some might just add 2 to 30, or multiply 2 by 4 (for 4 pm).
*   **Not understanding "increases":** Some might subtract.
*   **Language:** Simply not understanding the question at all.

Given these considerations, here's my estimate for full marks (specifically for calculating 6 hours):

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 30% full marks
competent: 70% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
