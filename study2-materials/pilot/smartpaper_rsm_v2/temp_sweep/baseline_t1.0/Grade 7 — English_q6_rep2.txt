Here's my assessment based on my experience with Class 7 English students in an Indian government school, considering the given student demographics and challenges:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** These students will struggle to even understand the question "Describes the poet's writing style." The words "describes," "poet's," and "writing style" are likely beyond their current comprehension.
* **Abstract concept:** "Writing style" is an abstract concept that requires a level of analysis and vocabulary they do not possess. They might be able to identify a word if given options, but generating one is impossible.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** This question requires reasoning and the ability to synthesize information from the poem, which is a significant hurdle.

**basic: 5% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** Some might partially understand "poet's" and "writing," but "style" would still be a challenge. They might pick up on a very obvious feature if the poem is exceptionally simple (e.g., "It's easy to understand").
* **Vocabulary limitations:** Even if they grasp the concept, their English vocabulary to describe it would be very limited. They might use a simple word like "good" or "nice," which wouldn't get full marks.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They struggle with the reasoning aspect. They might try to recall specific lines rather than analyzing the overall style.
* **Common mistakes:** Will likely use very general, non-specific words, or misunderstand the question entirely and describe the content of the poem instead of the *style*. A very rare student might, by chance or by having a slightly better grasp of one specific poem, hit upon "simple" or "easy."

**competent: 40% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** They will likely understand the question.
* **Vocabulary:** They would possess a basic vocabulary to attempt an answer. Words like "simple," "clear," "descriptive," or "easy" are within their reach.
* **Reasoning:** They can usually identify an obvious characteristic of the poet's style, especially if it's not overly complex. They might notice if the language is straightforward or if there's a lot of imagery.
* **Common mistakes:** Some might still provide a slightly vague answer ("good writing") or struggle to find the *most* appropriate single word. They might also confuse "style" with "theme" or "message" if the poem is not explicitly simple in its presentation.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** No issue understanding the question.
* **Vocabulary:** They will have a broader vocabulary and can select more precise descriptors (e.g., "evocative," "vivid," "colloquial," "lyrical," in addition to "simple" or "descriptive").
* **Reasoning:** They can easily analyze and identify key characteristics of the poet's writing style.
* **Common mistakes:** A small percentage might overthink it and try to use a very complex descriptor that isn't quite fitting, or they might struggle if the poem's style is exceptionally subtle or ambiguous, which is rare for a Class 7 text. They might also, in a rare instance, struggle to condense their understanding into a single, appropriate word.
