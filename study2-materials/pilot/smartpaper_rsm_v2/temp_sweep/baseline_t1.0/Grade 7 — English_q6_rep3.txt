This is a challenging question for most of my students, especially given the "writing style" part. Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Most struggling students would not understand "writing style" at all. They might pick out a random word from the poem if they could read it, but it wouldn't be relevant to style.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires reasoning about literary elements, which is far beyond their current comprehension. They'd struggle even with basic recall of facts from the poem.
* **Common mistakes:** They'd likely leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant, like "good" or "nice" if prompted to say *something*.

**basic: 5% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** A few basic students might vaguely grasp "writing style" if I've introduced the concept before, but their understanding would be very superficial. They'd struggle to connect it to specific features.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might be able to identify a *feeling* the poem evokes (e.g., happy, sad) but translating that into a *writing style* word (like "simple" or "descriptive") would be difficult.
* **Common mistakes:** They might write "interesting," "easy to understand," or "fun," which are closer to an opinion of the poem than a description of its style. A very small number *might* accidentally stumble upon "simple" if the poem itself is very straightforward.

**competent: 40% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Competent students would generally understand "writing style." They might need a bit of prompting or prior discussion in class about what "style" means in poetry.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They have the ability to reason and connect features of the poem (e.g., use of everyday language, clear imagery) to a descriptive word like "simple," "descriptive," or "direct." They might still struggle with more nuanced terms like "informal."
* **Common mistakes:** Some might still lean towards general positive adjectives rather than stylistic ones. Others might get confused between the poet's style and the poem's theme. However, many would be able to pick out "simple" or "descriptive" if the poem lends itself to those.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Advanced students would fully understand "writing style."
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would be able to analyze the poem's language, structure, and imagery to identify appropriate stylistic descriptors. They could use words like "simple," "descriptive," "direct," "evocative," or "narrative" (if applicable).
* **Common mistakes:** Even advanced students might occasionally use a less precise word, but they would almost always hit on a relevant and suitable one within the rubric's scope. The 10% not getting full marks might pick a word that is technically correct but not the *most* fitting, or slightly misinterpret a nuance.
