Okay, let's break this down from the perspective of teaching Class 8 Social Science in an Indian government school, with all the nuances you've described.

The question: "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"
Scoring rubric: For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab). Max score: 1

**Thinking Process:**

*   **Language Barrier:** This is the *biggest* hurdle. Many students, especially the struggling and basic ones, will struggle to even fully comprehend the question in English. They might pick out "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "British power," but connecting "contribute to expansion" and forming a coherent answer in English is tough. I would have definitely taught this in Hindi/mixed language in class.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question primarily requires recall of a specific consequence. It's not a deep reasoning question, but it requires understanding the *impact* rather than just *what happened*. They need to recall "What was the *result* of Plassey for the British?"
*   **Specificity:** The required answer is quite specific: "political dominance/control over Bengal" and the "puppet nawab" example. Just saying "British became powerful" might not get full marks.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Misunderstanding the question:** Simply narrating *who fought whom* or *what happened during the battle* instead of its *contribution* to British power.
    *   **Vague answers:** "British became stronger," "They got more land."
    *   **Language struggle:** Inability to articulate the correct answer in English, even if they understand it in Hindi.
    *   **Confusing with other battles/events:** Mixing up consequences of Plassey with Buxar or other early British victories.
    *   **Forgetting "Bengal":** Just saying "political control" without specifying "Bengal."

**Percentage Breakdown:**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   Many will not understand the question fully.
    *   Even if they remember "Plassey" and "British," articulating the political dominance over Bengal will be extremely difficult in English.
    *   They might recall "Mir Jafar" but struggle to link it to "puppet" or "control."
    *   *My expectation:* Very few, almost none, will get the full, specific answer. Maybe 1-2% if they coincidentally remembered a key phrase and could write it down.
    *   **struggling: 1% full marks**

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   They might understand the general gist of the question in English, especially if they try to translate it mentally or recall the Hindi explanation.
    *   They would remember that the British "won" and "became powerful."
    *   Some might vaguely say "British got control" or "Mir Jafar became king," but struggle to add "puppet" or specify "Bengal" for full clarity.
    *   The specificity of "political dominance/control over Bengal" and the puppet nawab example will be a stretch for most. They might get partial credit for "British got control."
    *   *My expectation:* A small fraction might hit all the points, likely those who have a slightly better grasp of English and recall.
    *   **basic: 8% full marks**

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   These students will largely understand the question and have a good grasp of the content.
    *   They should be able to recall the key consequence: British control over Bengal.
    *   Many would mention Mir Jafar as a puppet.
    *   The main challenge would be precise English phrasing to match the rubric perfectly.
    *   *My expectation:* A good portion will get it right. Some might miss "Bengal" but get the puppet part, or vice-versa, leading to near-misses for full marks.
    *   **competent: 60% full marks**

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   These students understand the English question clearly and have a strong command of the subject matter.
    *   They would confidently state the establishment of British political control over Bengal and cite Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab.
    *   Their English phrasing would likely be accurate and precise.
    *   *My expectation:* The vast majority would score full marks, perhaps only a minor slip in wording preventing 100%.
    *   **advanced: 90% full marks**
