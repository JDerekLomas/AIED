Here's my breakdown of how my Class 6 English students would likely perform on that question, given their background and the specific nature of the question:

**Important Context:**

*   **The "Book":** This question *must* be referring to a specific text we've studied in class. I'm assuming it's a story where a magical fairy *literally* lives inside a book, not just a character *in* a book. If it's a general question without a specific text, the answer would be 0% for everyone as it makes no sense. I'll proceed assuming it's a recall question from a specific story recently covered.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is a direct recall question. There's no reasoning involved beyond remembering the story's details.
*   **Specificity:** "A magical fairy" or "fairy" is quite specific but also the core subject of the answer. "Magical fairy" is a slightly better answer but "fairy" is perfectly acceptable.

struggling: **5%** full marks
*   **Why so low?** These students struggle significantly with reading comprehension and recalling specific details from English texts. Even if we've read the story multiple times, they often get lost in the overall plot and miss specific character attributes or locations. Many would struggle to even read "Who lived inside the book?" correctly, let alone formulate an answer in English. They might remember *something* about a fairy but not connect it to "inside the book" or express it coherentl.

basic: **40%** full marks
*   **Why this percentage?** These students understand basic English and can follow a story with some effort and teacher support. They likely remember the main characters and key plot points. If the story was covered recently and the "fairy inside the book" was a prominent feature, many would recall it. However, some might just remember "fairy" but forget the "magical" part, or struggle with the exact phrasing. They might also confuse it with other details if the story had multiple fantastical elements.

competent: **85%** full marks
*   **Why high?** These students can read and comprehend most of the text. They pay attention to details and are generally good at recalling information from stories. If we've discussed the story and the unique aspect of the fairy living *inside* the book, they would likely remember it and be able to articulate the answer correctly. They are less likely to miss the "magical" descriptor if it was emphasized.

advanced: **100%** full marks
*   **Why full marks?** These students have strong English comprehension skills. They read attentively, remember details, and can formulate answers clearly. They would undoubtedly recall the specific detail of the magical fairy living inside the book and provide the correct answer, including "magical" if it was part of the story's description. They are adept at extracting specific information from a text.
