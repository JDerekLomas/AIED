Okay, let's break this down based on my experience in a government school, Class 8.

The question is quite specific about the *contribution* to the *expansion* of British power, linking it to the *Battle of Plassey 1757* and asking for the connection. The rubric requires explaining political dominance/control over Bengal, specifically mentioning Mir Jafar as a puppet.

Here's my estimation:

*   **Language barriers:** This is a major hurdle. Even if they've *heard* about Plassey, understanding the nuance of "contribute to the expansion" and formulating a coherent answer in English is tough for many. They might recall facts but struggle to articulate the cause-and-effect relationship required for the rubric.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** It requires both recall (Battle of Plassey, 1757, Mir Jafar) and a level of reasoning to connect these facts to the *expansion of British power* through *political dominance*. Simple recall of "Plassey happened, British won" won't get full marks. They need to explain *how* that victory led to power.
*   **Specificity of required answer:** "Political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)" is quite specific. Just saying "British became powerful" or "they got money" won't suffice.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Vagueness:** "British won and got more powerful." (Doesn't explain *how* or *where*).
    *   **Focus on economic aspects:** Many students recall the economic exploitation that followed Plassey (trade, revenue collection) but struggle to connect it to the *initial political dominance* as the *direct result* of the battle.
    *   **Chronological confusion:** Some might know bits and pieces but struggle to link them coherently.
    *   **Direct translation issues:** Hindi-medium students often translate literally, which can make their English answers grammatically incorrect or unclear.
    *   **Inability to articulate the 'puppet' concept:** While they might know Mir Jafar was made Nawab, explaining that he was a 'puppet' or under 'British control' is a higher-level articulation.

Here's my estimation:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*(They might recall "Plassey" or "British won" but won't be able to articulate the political dominance or the puppet Nawab concept in English sufficiently.)*

**basic:** 5% full marks
*(A small percentage here might manage to connect the victory to British control over Bengal, perhaps mentioning Mir Jafar, even if the language isn't perfect. Many would say "British became strong" or "got money" but miss the political angle.)*

**competent:** 40% full marks
*(These students have a better grasp of concepts and can typically form more coherent sentences. They are more likely to articulate the British gaining political control over Bengal and might mention Mir Jafar as a puppet, hitting the key points of the rubric.)*

**advanced:** 80% full marks
*(These students understand the nuances, can recall specific details like Mir Jafar, and articulate the concept of political dominance and control over Bengal clearly in English. The remaining 20% might lose a mark due to minor language issues or a slightly less precise explanation.)*
