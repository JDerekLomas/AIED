This is a common question in our Class 6 English curriculum, and I have a good sense of how my students would perform. Given their diverse backgrounds and proficiency levels, the scores would vary significantly.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language Barriers:** Many of these students struggle with decoding individual words, let alone understanding the overall meaning of a line or the poem. They would find it very difficult to *identify* a line, let alone *express* a reason.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires both. They'd struggle with recall (finding a line they "like") and even more with reasoning (explaining *why*).
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might point to a random line or not answer at all. If they try to answer, it would likely be in Hindi, or a jumbled English phrase without a clear connection to the "why." They often lack the vocabulary and sentence structure to articulate a reason in English.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   **Language Barriers:** These students can often read the words aloud, but comprehension beyond a very literal level is challenging. They might understand the surface meaning of a simple line.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might be able to *identify* a line, especially if it's short and has concrete imagery. However, articulating *why* they like it in English would be the main hurdle. They might give very simplistic reasons like "it is good" or "I like this."
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might choose a line but provide a very vague or non-specific reason. For example, they might say "I like 'the bird sings' because the bird sings." They lack the ability to connect the line to a personal feeling or a deeper meaning. They might also give a reason in broken English that doesn't quite make sense.

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   **Language Barriers:** These students can generally read and understand most lines of a Class 6 poem. They might need some prompting or clarification for more abstract concepts.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would be able to identify a line and likely formulate a reason. The challenge would be in providing a *specific* enough reason that goes beyond a very literal interpretation.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Some might provide a reason that is too general or not deeply connected to the nuances of the poem. For instance, "I like the line 'the flowers bloom' because flowers are beautiful." While correct, it's not always specific enough for "full marks" if the poem offers more profound reasons for liking that line (e.g., freedom, hope). They might also make grammatical errors, but the core idea would be discernible.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Language Barriers:** These students are comfortable with the language and can understand the poem's meaning, including subtle implications.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would easily identify a line and articulate a clear, specific, and often thoughtful reason for their choice. They have the vocabulary and grammatical structures to express their ideas effectively.
*   **Common Mistakes:** The occasional grammatical error might occur, or a reason might be slightly less insightful than another student's, but they would definitely meet the criteria of "denotes a line and mentions why." Very rarely, one might struggle to articulate a reason if the poem itself is exceptionally abstract, but for a Class 6 poem, this is unlikely.
