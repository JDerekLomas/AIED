Here's my breakdown of expected full marks for this question, based on my experience in a Class 6 English government school setting:

**Poem Context (Assumed):** For this question to make sense, the students would have recently studied a poem. Let's assume it was a relatively simple poem, perhaps from their NCERT textbook, with clear imagery and a positive message, like "The Kite" or "Where the Mind is Without Fear" (simplified version) or even a nature poem. The key is that they would have been exposed to it multiple times, with the teacher explaining the meaning of lines.

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **"Which line from the poem do you like the most..."**: This requires recall AND personal choice. Students need to remember lines from the poem.
*   **"...and why?"**: This requires reasoning and expression. This is the more challenging part for most students. They need to articulate *why* they like a particular line, which involves understanding its meaning and connecting it to a feeling or idea.
*   **Scoring Rubric: "Denotes a line from the poem AND mentions why."**: Both parts are essential.
*   **Max score: 1.5**: This suggests a degree of leniency in the "why" part, but still requires a valid reason.

**Common Challenges for My Students:**

1.  **Reading Comprehension:** Even if they've heard the poem, recalling specific lines in written form can be tough for those struggling with reading English. They might mix up lines or misquote.
2.  **Vocabulary for "Why":** Students often lack the specific vocabulary to express their reasons effectively. They might say "good" or "nice" but struggle to elaborate.
3.  **Translating Thought to English:** Many students will form their "why" in Hindi and then try to translate it directly, leading to grammatically incorrect or awkward English.
4.  **Confidence:** The act of choosing a line and then articulating a personal reason can be intimidating for students who lack confidence in their English abilities. They might simply write a line without the "why" to avoid making a mistake.
5.  **Understanding "Why":** Some students might not fully grasp what kind of "reason" is expected. They might give a descriptive answer rather than an analytical or emotional one.
6.  **Copying:** A common mistake, especially in mixed-ability classrooms, is for weaker students to copy an answer from a slightly stronger peer if they hear it or see it.

Here's my breakdown of expected full marks:

*   **Struggling (35% of students): 0% full marks**
    *   They might write a word or two from the poem, or even a completely unrelated sentence.
    *   Many wouldn't attempt the "why" part at all.
    *   If they manage a line, it would likely be incorrect or incomplete.
    *   Their "why" would be non-existent or completely off-topic.
    *   They might confuse it with another poem or simply stare blankly.

*   **Basic (35% of students): 10% full marks**
    *   A significant portion might be able to recall *a* line, possibly with some errors.
    *   Their "why" would be extremely simplistic, like "because it is nice" or "it sounds good." Even with leniency, this might not always fully meet "mentions why" if it lacks any substance.
    *   A small percentage, perhaps those who grasped the main emotion of the poem and have a slightly better vocabulary, might manage a simple, valid reason like "I like it because it talks about trees" (if the poem was about trees).
    *   Many would get 0.5 or 1 mark, but full 1.5 would be rare due to the simplicity of their "why."

*   **Competent (20% of students): 60% full marks**
    *   Most students in this group would be able to accurately recall a line from the poem.
    *   They would be able to formulate a basic, understandable reason, even if the English isn't perfect.
    *   For example, "I like the line 'The kite flies high' because it makes me think of freedom" or "I like 'Where the mind is without fear' because it talks about a good country."
    *   They might make grammatical errors in their "why," but the core reason would be clear enough to score full marks given the rubric's leniency.

*   **Advanced (10% of students): 90% full marks**
    *   These students would have no trouble recalling a line and articulating a clear, relevant reason
