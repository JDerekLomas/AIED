This is a classic sentence rearrangement task, and while it seems straightforward to a fluent English speaker, it presents several hurdles for my Class 6 students, especially those from Hindi-medium backgrounds.

Here's my breakdown:

*   **Language Barriers (reading):** Many struggling and even some basic students will have difficulty simply reading all the words correctly. *Book*, *is*, *a* are easy. *Reading* and *he* might be mispronounced or misinterpreted initially.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires reasoning based on their understanding of basic English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object). They'll need to identify the 'doer' (he), the 'action' (reading), and the 'what' (a book). It's not pure recall, but applying a learned pattern.
*   **Specific Answer:** The answer is very specific: "He is reading a book." No other arrangement is acceptable.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Word order confusion:** The biggest challenge. They might put the verb first, or the object first, like "Reading he is a book" or "A book is he reading."
    *   **Omitting words:** Accidentally leaving out 'a' or 'is'.
    *   **Capitalization/Punctuation:** While not directly assessed by the rubric, it's a common error that reflects a general lack of understanding of sentence formation.
    *   **Direct translation from Hindi:** Hindi sentence structure is often Subject-Object-Verb, which can interfere. "He book reading is" (वह किताब पढ़ रहा है - Vah kitaab padh raha hai) is a common mental block.

Given these factors, here's my estimate:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 30% full marks
competent: 75% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
