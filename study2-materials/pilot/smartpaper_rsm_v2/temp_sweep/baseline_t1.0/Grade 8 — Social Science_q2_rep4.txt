Okay, this is a very practical question. As an experienced teacher in a Class 8 Government school, I've taught this topic many times and know my students well.

Here's my breakdown for the question: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Analysis of the Question:**
*   **Topic:** Harappan Civilization - Urban Planning. This is a core topic usually covered in Class 6/7 history and reinforced in Class 8. So, the content *should* be familiar.
*   **Cognitive Skill:** Recall. It requires remembering specific facts learned.
*   **Specificity:** "One key feature." This means students don't need to list everything, just pick one prominent aspect.
*   **Language:** "Describe one key feature." The language is relatively simple, but "urban planning" might be slightly technical for some, though we usually simplify it in class as "शहरों की बनावट" or "नियोजन."

**Common Student Challenges & Considerations:**

1.  **Language Barrier (English):** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they know the answer in Hindi, expressing it accurately in English can be tough.
    *   "Grid layout" -> May know "सड़कें सीधी थीं, एक-दूसरे को काटती थीं" but struggle with "grid layout."
    *   "Advanced drainage system" -> May know "पक्की नालियां थीं, ढकी हुई थीं" but struggle with "advanced drainage system."
    *   "Baked bricks" -> May know "पक्की ईंटें" but might just write "bricks" or struggle with "baked."
    *   "Citadel and lower town" -> May know "ऊंचा हिस्सा और नीचा हिस्सा" but struggle with "citadel" and "lower town."

2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:** It's pure recall. If they haven't revised or didn't grasp it well during teaching, they won't get it.

3.  **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric allows for several correct answers. This is good, as it gives students options. However, vague answers like "cities were good" won't score. They need to mention a *specific* feature.

4.  **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Vague answers:** "Cities were nice." "They had houses."
    *   **Incorrect details:** Confusing Harappan features with other civilizations.
    *   **Partial answers:** Stating "streets" but not "grid pattern" or "straight."
    *   **Grammatical errors/Poor English:** Even if they know the feature, their written English might make it difficult to understand. I'd usually be lenient on grammar if the core idea is present.
    *   **Not answering the "key feature" part:** Describing something else about the Harappan civilization (e.g., their pottery, agriculture) instead of urban planning.

Based on my experience, here's my estimate:

*   **struggling: 5% full marks**
    *   These students struggle with basic literacy in English and often miss core concepts. Even if I've taught it in Hindi, recalling and writing *anything* coherent in English is a major challenge. The 5% would be those who might have memorized a very simple phrase like "Pakkki eentein" and can transliterate/write "baked bricks" or "good drainage."
*   **basic: 30% full marks**
    *   They understand the Hindi explanation and can recall some facts. The challenge for them is translating that knowledge into acceptable English. Many might write "straight roads" or "covered drains" or "pakka bricks," which would likely score full marks given the leniency I'd apply for language. They might struggle with "grid layout" or "citadel."
*   **competent: 80% full marks**
    *   These students grasp concepts well and can usually express themselves reasonably in English. They would recall one of the major features (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, two-part city) and be able to articulate it clearly enough to get full marks. They might not use perfect academic English, but the core idea would be evident.
*   **advanced: 95% full marks**
    *   These students excel. They understand the concept, retain information, and can articulate it well in English. They would likely provide a clear and concise answer using appropriate terminology, scoring full marks easily. The 5% who might not score would be due to a rare lapse in recall or misinterpretation of "key feature."
