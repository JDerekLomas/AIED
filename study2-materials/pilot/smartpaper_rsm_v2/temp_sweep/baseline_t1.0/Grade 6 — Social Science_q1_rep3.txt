This is a classic recall question, but the language barrier is a significant hurdle for many.

**struggling:** 0% full marks
* **Language barrier:** They wouldn't even be able to read and understand the question properly, let alone recall the answer in English. Even if they knew the names in Hindi, translating or recognizing them in English would be very difficult.
* **Recall:** While it's a recall question, the specific recall of *English names* is the challenge.

**basic:** 10% full marks
* **Language barrier:** Some might struggle with the English, but a few might grasp "mountain ranges" and "India".
* **Recall:** They might vaguely remember "Himalayas" as a big mountain, but remembering a second one, or spelling them correctly, would be a problem. Many might just write "Himalaya" (singular) or struggle with the spelling. A few might get lucky with one name.

**competent:** 60% full marks
* **Language barrier:** Most would understand the question.
* **Recall:** They would likely recall "Himalayas" easily. For the second, some might recall Aravalli, Vindhya, or Satpura, which are often discussed in Class 6. They might make minor spelling errors, but the core name would be recognizable.
* **Common mistakes:** Spelling errors, or only providing one range.

**advanced:** 90% full marks
* **Language barrier:** No issue here.
* **Recall:** They would confidently recall at least two major ranges (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western/Eastern Ghats) and spell them reasonably accurately.
* **Common mistakes:** Very rare, perhaps a very minor spelling slip.
