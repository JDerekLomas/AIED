Namaste bachcho! (Hello children!)

Let's break down this temperature problem and think about how my wonderful Class 6 students would tackle it.

First, I'd probably write the question on the blackboard in Hindi as well, or at least explain the key terms in Hindi, like "temperature" (taapmaan), "increases" (badhta hai), and "per hour" (prati ghanta). This is crucial for *all* my students.

Here's my breakdown by ability level:

**Struggling: 5% full marks**

*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even with Hindi explanation, understanding the full context of "increases by 2 degrees C *per hour*" can be tough. They might get "temperature" and "Jodhpur" but miss the dynamic part.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This isn't a direct recall problem. It requires a multi-step reasoning process: calculating elapsed time, then multiplying. This is a big leap for them.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   They might just add 2 to 30, thinking it's a single increase.
    *   They might struggle to count the hours correctly from 10 am to 4 pm, especially crossing the 12 pm mark.
    *   They might multiply 4 (from 4:00 pm) by 2, or make other arbitrary calculations.
    *   Arithmetic errors (30 + something) even if they get part of the setup right.
    *   For the rubric point (time elapsed), they would most likely struggle to systematically count the hours.

**Basic: 30% full marks**

*   **Language Barrier:** With some initial Hindi explanation, they can grasp the core idea. They understand "temperature" and "increase."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can handle single-step problems well. Multi-step is where it gets tricky. They might understand "increase by 2 degrees" but struggle with *how many times* to increase it.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Time Calculation:** This is the most common pitfall. They might count 10 to 4 as 4 hours, or 5 hours, forgetting to include the 10-11 hour. This is the exact point the rubric focuses on. Many will miss counting 11-12, 12-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 accurately. They might even just subtract 10 from 4 directly, leading to confusion.
    *   They might correctly calculate 6 hours but then add 2 degrees only once, or multiply 30 by 2.
    *   They might set up the multiplication correctly (6 x 2) but make a calculation error.
    *   *For the rubric point (6 hours):* Many will get close (5 hours or 7 hours) but not precisely 6 hours, missing full marks for that specific step.

**Competent: 70% full marks**

*   **Language Barrier:** With a quick glance or minimal explanation, they can usually understand the question fully.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They are comfortable with multi-step problems. They can break it down into finding the time difference and then applying the rate of increase.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Still, the *most common error* even at this level will be in the **precise counting of hours**. 10 am to 4 pm can sometimes trip them up. They might accidentally count 5 hours instead of 6, or vice-versa. This is a recurring issue when time spans the noon mark.
    *   Less common, but possible, are arithmetic errors in 6 x 2 or 30 + 12.
    *   *For the rubric point (6 hours):* A good portion will get this right, but a significant minority might still miscount by an hour.

**Advanced: 95% full marks**

*   **Language Barrier:** No issue at all. They read and comprehend easily.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They identify this as a multi-step problem involving time calculation and multiplication/addition. They can quickly formulate the steps.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Extremely rare, but an advanced student might make a simple arithmetic slip (e.g., 6 x 2 = 14) due to carelessness, or misread "per hour" as "per two hours" (very unlikely).
    *   The time calculation from 10 am to 4 pm is generally straightforward for them. They would typically count it out as 10-11 (1), 11-12 (
