Okay, let's break this down based on my experience in a Class 7 government school in India, keeping in mind the specific student profile.

**Analysis of the Question and Potential Difficulties:**

*   **Active to Passive Voice Transformation:** This is a core grammatical concept taught in Class 6/7.
*   **Vocabulary:** "Blew" (past tense of blow) and "away" are relatively common words, but "blew" might still be a hurdle for some struggling readers. "Leaves" is common.
*   **Syntactic Complexity:** The original sentence is simple SVO. The transformation requires understanding tense, identifying subject/object, and knowing the past participle ("blown") of an irregular verb ("blow").
*   **Irregular Verb "blow-blew-blown":** This is a *major* stumbling block for all but the most proficient students. Many will struggle to recall "blown." They might try "blowed" or simply keep "blew."
*   **"by the wind":** While grammatically correct and part of the full transformation, many students (even those who get the core change) might omit the "by the agent" phrase, especially if they are focusing on just getting the subject/verb/object right. The rubric specifically asks for the "by the wind" part.
*   **"were" vs. "was":** Plural object "leaves" requires "were." This could be an error for basic/struggling students who might default to "was."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** It requires both. Recalling the rules of passive voice, recalling the past participle, and then applying them correctly to the given sentence.
*   **Reading Comprehension:** "The wind blew the leaves away" is simple, but for struggling readers, even this can be slow and laborious, consuming mental energy before they even start the grammar task.

**Estimated Full Marks Percentage:**

Given these factors, especially the irregular verb and the "by the agent" requirement for *full* marks:

*   **struggling (35%): 0% full marks**
    *   They will struggle with reading the sentence, identifying the verb, knowing "blew" is past tense, and certainly won't recall "blown." They might try to rephrase it in an active way, or just write random words. They are unlikely to get any part correct.
*   **basic (35%): 5% full marks**
    *   A small fraction of these might grasp the idea of swapping subject/object and using "were," but the irregular verb "blown" will be their downfall. They might write "The leaves were blew away by the wind" or "The leaves were blowed away..." If they somehow get "blown," they might miss "by the wind." The chances of *both* are very slim.
*   **competent (20%): 40% full marks**
    *   These students have a decent grasp of grammar. They will likely identify the tense, the subject, and the object. The main hurdle will still be the irregular verb "blown." Many might get "The leaves were blew away" or "The leaves were blowed away." However, about 40% of this group would have practiced enough irregular verbs to recall "blown" and also correctly include "by the wind."
*   **advanced (10%): 85% full marks**
    *   These students are generally strong in English. They would know the rules for passive voice, understand irregular verbs, and be able to apply them. The 15% who might *not* get full marks could be due to a momentary lapse in recalling "blown" or an oversight in adding "by the wind" under exam pressure, rather than a lack of understanding.
