This is a good question that highlights the challenges we face daily. Here's my breakdown based on my experience:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   They would struggle significantly with understanding the question itself, let alone recalling a precise definition. "Define" is a challenging instruction.
*   "Fable" is likely an unfamiliar word or a word they've only vaguely heard.
*   They might recall a story like "The Lion and the Mouse" but wouldn't be able to articulate the *characteristics* of a fable.
*   Even if they recognize "kahani" (story), the specific elements like "animals as characters" and "moral lesson" would be beyond their current English vocabulary and conceptual understanding.

**basic: 5% full marks**
*   Some might recognize the word "fable" if it's been discussed recently and if they are good at rote memorization.
*   They might recall *one* aspect, like "it's a story with animals," but struggle to include "moral lesson."
*   Their English expression would be very basic, making it hard to form a coherent definition, even if they have some understanding.
*   A few might have memorized a simple definition if it was explicitly taught and written on the board, but the "typically uses animals as characters" and "imparts a moral lesson" is quite specific. They might say "animal story" and "lesson."

**competent: 40% full marks**
*   These students are more likely to have a foundational understanding of what a fable is.
*   They would recall key elements like "story," "animals," and "moral/lesson."
*   Their challenge would be in structuring the definition precisely to meet all parts of the rubric. They might miss "typically uses animals" and just say "uses animals," or might struggle with "imparts a moral lesson" and say "gives a lesson."
*   If we've explicitly taught and practiced definitions, their chances increase.

**advanced: 85% full marks**
*   These students would likely have encountered the term "fable" before, possibly in previous classes or through wider reading (even in Hindi).
*   They have stronger English vocabulary and sentence construction skills.
*   They would understand the need for a comprehensive definition and be able to articulate both the "animals as characters" and "moral lesson" aspects accurately.
*   Their main challenge might be recalling the exact phrasing if they haven't specifically memorized *this* particular definition, but they would get very close.
