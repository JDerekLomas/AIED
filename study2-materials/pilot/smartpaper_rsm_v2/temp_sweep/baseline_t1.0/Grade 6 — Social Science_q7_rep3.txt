This is a great question to gauge understanding, but also highlights the challenges our students face. Let's break it down.

First, for the natural resources, Rajasthan is rich! Common ones I'd expect: water (though scarce, it's vital!), sand, marble, gypsum, mica, salt, copper, zinc, limestone, and even sunlight/wind for energy.

Now, let's think about the scoring for this specific question and our students.

**Understanding the question:**
*   "Natural resources": This is a key term we teach, but translating it to *prakritik sansadhan* is crucial.
*   "Found in Rajasthan": This requires specific geographical knowledge.
*   "Explain how one of them influences the lives": This demands a basic cause-and-effect understanding and descriptive ability.

**Challenges for students:**
1.  **Language:** "Mention," "natural resources," "influences," "lives" – these are all potential stumbling blocks for our Hindi-medium students. Many will struggle to *read* the question, let alone *understand* it fully.
2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Identifying two resources is recall. Explaining influence is basic reasoning, requiring a connection between the resource and human activity.
3.  **Specificity:** The question asks for *any* two, which is good. The explanation needs to be specific enough.
4.  **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Listing man-made things instead of natural resources.
    *   Naming resources not found in Rajasthan.
    *   Not being able to articulate the influence clearly due to language or lack of conceptual clarity.
    *   Only listing resources and not explaining the influence.

Based on my experience:

**struggling:** **0% full marks**
*   They will struggle immensely with reading the question. Even if they recognise "Rajasthan," the rest of the vocabulary will be too difficult. They might point to pictures of resources if I show them, but writing it down or explaining is beyond them at this stage.

**basic:** **10% full marks**
*   A small percentage might be able to identify "Rajasthan" and "natural resources" (if we've drilled it recently). They might name one or two common resources like "sand" or "water" (pani), often in Hindi or broken English. Explaining the influence is where they'll likely fall short due to language and structuring their thoughts. They might say "pani is important" but struggle to elaborate.

**competent:** **50% full marks**
*   These students will likely understand the question's core. They'll probably name two correct natural resources (e.g., sand and water, or marble and copper). They might be able to give a basic explanation for one, such as "Sand is used to make houses" or "Water is used for drinking and farming." Their explanation might be simple and not fully detailed, but it will be a correct influence.

**advanced:** **90% full marks**
*   These students will read and understand the question easily. They will correctly identify two natural resources (e.g., Marble and Copper, or Water and Sand). Their explanation for the influence of one will be clear and concise, for example: "Marble is found in Rajasthan and is used for building houses, monuments, and statues. Many people work in marble quarries, so it provides jobs and income for families." They might even think of multiple influences. The only reason it's not 100% is a very rare chance of a misunderstanding or a silly mistake.
