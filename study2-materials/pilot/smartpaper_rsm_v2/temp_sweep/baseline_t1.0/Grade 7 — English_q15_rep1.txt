Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 7 English students in a government school, keeping in mind the specific context.

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language Barriers:** These students would struggle immensely just to decode the prompt. "Paragraph," "favourite," "hobby," "mention," "enjoyable" would all be difficult words. They might just write one or two words.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** While it's recall of personal information, the *articulation* of it in English is a major hurdle. They might have a hobby but cannot express it.
* **Common Mistakes:** One-word answers, writing in Hindi, completely misunderstanding the question and writing about something else entirely (e.g., "My school"), or simply drawing. Sentence construction is virtually non-existent.

**basic: 10% full marks**
* **Language Barriers:** They would understand key words like "hobby," "when," "why," but linking them into coherent sentences would be a struggle. "Paragraph" might still be a vague concept.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall their hobby, but forming four to five *complete and grammatically acceptable* sentences is a significant leap.
* **Common Mistakes:** They might write 2-3 very short, simple sentences with grammatical errors (e.g., "My hobby is play cricket. I play in evening. It is good."). They might omit "why I enjoy it" or give a very generic answer like "It is fun." The idea of a *complete* paragraph with all elements specifically mentioned would be missed by most.

**competent: 60% full marks**
* **Language Barriers:** They would understand the prompt well.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can articulate their hobby, when they do it, and why.
* **Common Mistakes:** The main challenge here would be writing *four to five* complete sentences. Some might write three good ones, or five very short, slightly repetitive ones. There might be minor grammatical errors (e.g., missing 's' in verbs, incorrect prepositions) but the meaning would be clear. They might struggle to vary sentence structure, but the core information would be present.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language Barriers:** No issue with understanding the prompt.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can easily recall and articulate the information.
* **Common Mistakes:** A few might write six sentences instead of five, or have a very minor, isolated grammatical slip. They would be able to construct a clear, well-structured paragraph that addresses all parts of the prompt, often with a slightly richer vocabulary or more varied sentence structures than the 'competent' group.
