Let's break down how my Class 8 Science students might perform on this question, keeping their background and the scoring rubric in mind.

**Analyzing the Question:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The English is relatively simple, but words like "collected," "waste," "pit," "notice," "beneficial," and "soil health" might be slightly challenging for struggling students. "Evaluate" is a higher-order thinking verb that many might not grasp fully.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:**
    *   **Recall:** The idea of decomposition, organic matter, and compost is taught. They recall that "things rot."
    *   **Reasoning:** Connecting "rotting" to "changes," identifying *what* those changes are (smell, appearance, becoming manure), and then linking it to "beneficial for soil health" requires reasoning. "Give reasons" specifically asks for this. "Evaluate" also pushes beyond simple recall.
*   **Specificity:** "Significant changes" is somewhat subjective, but the implied changes are decomposition. The reasons need to link to decomposition. "Beneficial for soil health" requires a specific "yes" and why.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Simply saying "yes" without explaining the changes.
    *   Not linking the changes to decomposition (e.g., just saying "it will become dirty").
    *   Not fully explaining *why* it's beneficial for soil (e.g., just saying "it's good for plants").
    *   Getting stuck on the English phrasing and not understanding the core question.
    *   Forgetting the term "manure" or "compost."
    *   Confusing it with burning or simply throwing away.

**Applying to Student Groups:**

Given the rubric (suggests significant changes, implying decomposition), this is how I'd expect my students to perform:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Why so low?** Many will struggle with "notice any change" and "evaluate if this is beneficial." They might recall "ganda ho jayega" (it will become dirty) or "kharaab ho jayega" (it will spoil), but struggle to articulate *how* or *why* it's beneficial in English. The concept of decomposition is taught, but applying it and articulating it in English, plus linking it to "soil health," will be very difficult. They might just say "yes" but fail to give reasons or evaluate benefit.

**basic: 25% full marks**
*   **Why this percentage?** A good number of these students will understand the core idea of things rotting and forming "khaad" (manure). They might say "yes, it will change" and "it will become खाद (khaad)" or "मिट्टी बन जाएगी" (it will become soil). They might even link it to plants growing better. However, articulating *why* (decomposition by microorganisms) and fully evaluating the *benefit for soil health* in a structured way, addressing all parts of the question, will be a challenge for many. Some might miss explaining *what* changes occur, just stating a general outcome.

**competent: 70% full marks**
*   **Why this percentage?** These students generally grasp the concepts well and can communicate them, even if their English isn't perfect. They would likely state "yes, it will change," describe the rotting/decomposition, mention microorganisms, and connect it to forming compost/manure which enriches the soil and helps plants grow. They might not use highly sophisticated vocabulary, but they'll cover the key points required by the rubric. They are more likely to attempt to explain *why* it's beneficial.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Why so high?** These students would have a strong understanding of decomposition, the role of microbes, and the benefits of organic matter/compost for soil health (improving fertility, water retention, aeration). They would articulate the changes clearly (smell, appearance, texture) and logically connect them to the formation of manure, explaining its benefits for soil health explicitly. They are also less likely to be hindered by the English phrasing. The 5% gap accounts for a possible minor oversight or a slight misinterpretation of "significant changes" if they focus too much on just the end product.
