Here's my estimation based on teaching Class 7 English in a government school with the described student profile:

**Struggling: 5% full marks**
Even though it's a simple paragraph, the expectation of "complete paragraph" and "clearly mentions" would be a hurdle. Many in this group struggle with forming complete sentences, let alone combining them into a coherent paragraph. They might write isolated sentences like "My hobby is reading." or "I like it." but connecting them with appropriate conjunctions or transitional phrases would be difficult. They also might misspell many words, making their answer unclear. Recalling simple vocabulary is fine, but structuring it into a paragraph is a challenge.

**Basic: 30% full marks**
Students at this level can generally form simple sentences and understand basic instructions. They would likely be able to state their hobby, when they do it, and why they like it, but the "paragraph" part might be a bit rough. They might write three separate sentences instead of connecting them smoothly, or use very simplistic language. For example, "My hobby is playing cricket. I play in evening. I like it because it is fun." This might score full marks depending on how strictly "complete paragraph" is interpreted, but it won't be sophisticated. Spelling mistakes would be common but usually decipherable.

**Competent: 75% full marks**
These students have a better grasp of sentence structure and basic grammar. They would be able to construct a clear, albeit simple, paragraph. They might use slightly more varied vocabulary and attempt to link their sentences more cohesively. They would understand the expectation of a "paragraph" and generally fulfill the criteria without major errors. For example: "My favourite hobby is drawing. I usually draw in the afternoons after school. I enjoy it very much because it helps me relax and I love creating new things."

**Advanced: 95% full marks**
These students would easily achieve full marks. They would demonstrate good command of language, grammar, and sentence structure. Their paragraphs would be well-formed, coherent, and might even include some slightly more complex vocabulary or sentence variations. They would comfortably meet all the criteria and present a polished answer. The 5% who might not score full marks could be due to a careless error or misunderstanding of one small aspect of the prompt, rather than a lack of ability.
