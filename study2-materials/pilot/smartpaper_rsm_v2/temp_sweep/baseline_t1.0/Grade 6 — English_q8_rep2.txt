Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 6 students in a government school, keeping in mind the specific demographics and ability levels.

The sentence "He is reading a book" is a very common, simple present continuous structure. However, the context of Hindi-medium background and limited English proficiency is crucial.

*   **Language barriers (many can't read English well):** This is a significant hurdle. Many struggling students might not even be able to reliably identify individual words like "reading" or "book" quickly, let alone understand their meaning or function in a sentence. They might try to piece together words based on sound or appearance rather than comprehension.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** For most students, especially at the struggling and basic levels, this is primarily a recall task of a memorized sentence structure (Subject + is/am/are + Verb-ing + Object). They've likely seen "He is reading" or "She is singing" many times. For the advanced students, it might involve a bit more reasoning about grammatical roles, but even for them, it's a very standard pattern.
*   **Specificity of the required answer:** The answer "He is reading a book" is very specific. While other combinations might be grammatically plausible in different contexts (e.g., "A book is he reading" is not natural English, but a student might attempt it), only the SVO structure with present continuous is considered correct here.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Ignoring 'a':** Students often forget small words like 'a', 'an', 'the', or prepositions.
    *   **Incorrect word order:** The most common mistake would be putting the verb before the subject ("Is he reading a book" - turning it into a question) or mixing up the object and the auxiliary verb ("He reading is a book").
    *   **Literal translation issues:** Hindi word order is different (e.g., "वह किताब पढ़ रहा है" - Vah kitaab padh raha hai - He book reading is). This can lead to errors like "He book reading a is."
    *   **Inability to identify words:** Struggling readers might just put words in the order they were given or in a random sequence they think 'sounds' okay, without understanding the meaning.

Here's my estimation:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 40% full marks
competent: 85% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
