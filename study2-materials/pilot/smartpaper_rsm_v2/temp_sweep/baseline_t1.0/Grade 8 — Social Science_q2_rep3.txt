This is a great question that probes not just content recall but also the realities of our classroom. Let's break it down.

First, the *key feature* of Harappan urban planning is something we definitely cover. We spend time on it because it's so distinctive.

Now, let's consider the student groups:

*   **Language barriers:** This is the *biggest* hurdle. Even if they know the answer in Hindi, expressing it clearly in English is a challenge. "Describe one key feature" is a simple enough instruction, but for some, even "describe" can be a bit tricky.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is primarily a recall question. They either know a feature of urban planning or they don't.
*   **Specificity:** The rubric is quite specific – "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel/lower town." Vague answers like "it was well-planned" might not get full marks.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Not understanding the question:** Answering about their discovery or famous sites instead of urban planning.
    *   **Vague answers:** "They had good cities."
    *   **Language issues:** Knowing the concept but not being able to articulate it in English. For example, knowing "pucca bricks" but writing "strong bricks" which might not be specific enough without "baked."
    *   **Partial answers:** Mentioning streets but not "grid layout."

Based on my experience:

**struggling:** 0-5% full marks
*   Most in this group would struggle significantly with both understanding the question and formulating an English answer, even if they had some vague recall from class. They might say "bricks" but not "baked bricks" or "well-planned streets" without "grid." Getting the full "baked bricks" or "grid layout" with an understanding of "urban planning" would be rare.

**basic:** 20-30% full marks
*   This group likely has some memory of the key features. They might recall "drainage system" or "pucca bricks" (baked bricks). The challenge will be expressing it precisely in English. Some might say "good roads" instead of "grid pattern." Those who manage to articulate "well-planned drainage system" or "used baked bricks" would get it. The prompt only asks for *one* feature, which helps.

**competent:** 70-80% full marks
*   Most students in this group would recall at least one specific feature like the grid layout, the drainage system, or the division into citadel and lower town. Their English proficiency would generally be sufficient to describe it accurately (e.g., "The streets were laid out in a grid pattern" or "They had an advanced drainage system"). They are more likely to use the precise terminology we teach.

**advanced:** 90-100% full marks
*   These students would almost certainly recall multiple features and be able to articulate one clearly and accurately in English, using appropriate vocabulary (e.g., "The Harappan cities were characterized by a sophisticated grid layout of streets," or "A key feature was their advanced drainage system, with covered drains"). They would grasp the term "urban planning" fully.
