REASONING: This question requires specific historical knowledge of cause and effect (Battle of Plassey → control of Bengal), similar to the "three questions" item (50% pass) which required recalling specific points from a text, but likely harder as it depends on recalled curriculum knowledge rather than a provided passage.  
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
