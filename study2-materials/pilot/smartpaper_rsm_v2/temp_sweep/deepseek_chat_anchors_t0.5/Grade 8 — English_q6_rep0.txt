REASONING: This question requires a specific, textbook-style definition with two key components (animals as characters and a moral lesson), similar to the "archaeological vs literary sources" item (15% pass) which also required precise definitions and examples. It is more difficult than naming Fundamental Rights (66%) or listing simple facts from a passage (50%), but likely easier than writing a thematic summary (5%) or a paragraph (30%).

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
