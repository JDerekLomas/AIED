REASONING: This item requires both recall of a specific line and a simple personal justification, which is more demanding than naming fundamental rights (66%) but less complex than writing a theme (5%) or differentiating source types (15%). It is similar in cognitive demand to the "favorite season" paragraph (30%), but here the content is fixed (must use the poem), making it slightly harder.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
