REASONING: This question requires recall of specific state-based factual knowledge (resources of Rajasthan) and a brief explanation, making it more difficult than naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass) but likely easier than the abstract poem theme (5% pass). It is comparable to the "three questions" item (50% pass) in requiring recall of specific points.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
