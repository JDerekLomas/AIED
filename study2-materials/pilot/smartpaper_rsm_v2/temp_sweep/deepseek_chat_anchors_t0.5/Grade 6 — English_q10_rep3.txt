REASONING: This item is a basic grammar fill-in-the-blank with only two choices, requiring recognition of a positive statement ("There are") versus a negative/interrogative context for "any." It is far simpler than constructing a theme, differentiating concepts, writing a paragraph, recalling story details, or naming constitutional rights.
