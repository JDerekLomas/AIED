REASONING: This item is most similar to the "My favorite season" anchor (30% pass rate) but is simpler, as it asks for a personal, concrete hobby description rather than requiring seasonal activities, foods, and clothing. It is less abstract than the poem theme (5%) and less content-specific than the history sources (15%) or fundamental rights (66%) questions.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
