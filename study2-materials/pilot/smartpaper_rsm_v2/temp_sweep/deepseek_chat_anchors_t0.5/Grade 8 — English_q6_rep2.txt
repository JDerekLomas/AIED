REASONING: This question requires a specific, concise definition with two key elements (animals as characters, moral lesson), similar to the "archaeological vs. literary sources" item (15% pass) which also required a precise definition with examples, but likely slightly easier as it's a single concept. It is harder than naming Fundamental Rights (66%) or listing the three questions (50%), which are more direct recalls.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
