REASONING: This item requires both recall of a specific line and a simple personal justification, which is more demanding than naming rights or seasons but less complex than deriving a theme or differentiating source types. It is similar in cognitive demand to the "three questions" item (50% pass), but with an added subjective explanation, likely making it slightly harder.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
