REASONING: This item requires identifying a single word ("tiny") as an adjective, which is a simpler and more mechanical grammar task compared to the thematic interpretation, paragraph writing, or definition required in the anchor items. It is most similar to the 66% pass rate item (naming two Fundamental Rights), but is even more direct and has only one correct answer.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
