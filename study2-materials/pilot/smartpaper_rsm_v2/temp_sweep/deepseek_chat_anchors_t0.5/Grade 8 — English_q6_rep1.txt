REASONING: This question requires a specific, concise definition with two key elements (animals as characters and a moral lesson), similar to the "archaeological vs. literary sources" item (15% pass) which also required a definition with examples, but likely slightly easier as it's a single term. It is harder than naming Fundamental Rights (66%) but easier than writing a paragraph or identifying a poem's theme.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
