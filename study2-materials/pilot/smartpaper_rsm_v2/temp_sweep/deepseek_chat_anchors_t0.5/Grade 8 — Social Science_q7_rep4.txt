REASONING: This question requires specific historical knowledge of cause and effect (Battle of Plassey → control of Bengal), similar to the "three questions" item (50% pass) but more conceptually demanding than naming Fundamental Rights (66% pass). It is harder than recalling facts but less abstract than identifying a poem's theme (5% pass).

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
