REASONING: This question requires recall of specific state-based knowledge (Rajasthan's natural resources) and a brief explanation, making it more difficult than naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass) but likely easier than differentiating archaeological/literary sources (15% pass) due to more concrete, textbook-based answers.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
