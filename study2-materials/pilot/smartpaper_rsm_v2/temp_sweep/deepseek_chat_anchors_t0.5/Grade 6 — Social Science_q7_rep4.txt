REASONING: This question requires recall of specific state-based knowledge (Rajasthan's natural resources) and a brief explanation, making it more difficult than naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass) but likely easier than explaining a poem's theme (5% pass) or differentiating source types (15% pass). It is comparable to the "three questions" item (50% pass), but the need for local geographical knowledge adds a layer of difficulty.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
