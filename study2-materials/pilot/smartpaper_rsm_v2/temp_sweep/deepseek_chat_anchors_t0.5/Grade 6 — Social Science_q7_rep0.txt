REASONING: This question requires recall of specific state-based knowledge (Rajasthan's natural resources) and a brief explanation, making it more difficult than naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass) but likely easier than differentiating archaeological/literary sources (15% pass) or writing a thematic summary (5% pass). It is comparable to the "three questions" item (50% pass) but demands more than simple reproduction from a given passage.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
