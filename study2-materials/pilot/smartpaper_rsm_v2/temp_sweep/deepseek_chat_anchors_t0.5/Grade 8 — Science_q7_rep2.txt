REASONING: This question is about a simple, observable composting process, which is more concrete and likely covered in the Class 8 Science curriculum (microorganisms, manure) than the abstract poem theme (5% pass) or historical source differentiation (15% pass). It is closer in difficulty to naming Fundamental Rights (66% pass), but requires a basic causal explanation rather than just recall.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
