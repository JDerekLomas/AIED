REASONING: This item requires identifying a single word as an adjective, which is a simpler, more concrete task than explaining themes, differentiating concepts, writing paragraphs, or recalling specific story details or rights. It is most comparable to the 66% pass rate item (naming two Fundamental Rights), but is even more direct and has only one correct answer.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
