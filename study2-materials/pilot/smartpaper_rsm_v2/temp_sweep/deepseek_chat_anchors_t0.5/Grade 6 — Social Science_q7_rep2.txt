REASONING: This item requires recall of specific state-based knowledge (Rajasthan's natural resources) and a brief explanation, making it more difficult than naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass) but likely easier than the abstract poem theme (5% pass) or differentiating source types (15% pass). It is comparable to the "three questions" item (50% pass) but with added explanatory demand.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
