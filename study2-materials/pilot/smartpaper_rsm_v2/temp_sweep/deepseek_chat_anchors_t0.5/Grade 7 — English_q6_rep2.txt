REASONING: This item requires a single descriptive word about writing style, which is more abstract and less directly taught than recalling facts (like Fundamental Rights) or basic comprehension (like naming a season), making it harder than the 50% and 66% items but likely easier than the highly abstract theme question (5%) and the two-part differentiation question (15%).  
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
