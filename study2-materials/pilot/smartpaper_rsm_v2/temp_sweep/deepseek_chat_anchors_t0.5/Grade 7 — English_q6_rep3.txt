REASONING: This item requires a single descriptive word about writing style, which is more abstract and less directly taught than recalling facts (like Fundamental Rights) or basic comprehension (like naming a season), but less demanding than constructing a theme or differentiating source types. It is likely harder than the 66% and 50% anchor items but easier than the 15% and 5% ones.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
