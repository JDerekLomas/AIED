REASONING: This item requires both recall of a specific line and a simple personal justification, which is more demanding than naming two rights (66% pass) but less demanding than constructing a thematic interpretation (5% pass). It is similar in cognitive demand to the "favorite season" paragraph (30% pass), but with the added step of recalling text.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
