REASONING: This question requires specific, factual recall about Harappan urban planning, similar to the archaeological sources question (15% pass rate), but is more focused and likely less frequently emphasized than Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate). It is harder than naming rights but easier than extracting a poem's theme.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
