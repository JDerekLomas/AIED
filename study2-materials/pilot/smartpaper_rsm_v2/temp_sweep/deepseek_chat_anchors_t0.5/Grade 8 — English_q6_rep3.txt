REASONING: This question requires a specific, concise definition with two key elements (animals as characters and a moral lesson), similar to the "archaeological vs. literary sources" item (15% pass) which required a definition with examples, making it moderately difficult and likely harder than the factual recall items (50%, 66%).

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
