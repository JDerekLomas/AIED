REASONING: Given the extremely low pass rates on questions requiring abstract concepts (like "writing style" or "theme") and even simple paragraph construction, many students will likely struggle to identify grammatical terms. They might pick the wrong word or leave it empty, as "adjective phrase" is a specific grammatical concept often not fully grasped with their current proficiency. While "tiny" is a simple word, identifying it as an *adjective* (let alone an adjective *phrase*) will be a significant challenge for a large portion of the class.
