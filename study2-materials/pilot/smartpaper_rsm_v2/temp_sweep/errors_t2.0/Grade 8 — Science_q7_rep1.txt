REASONING: Students struggle with explaining concepts clearly and using scientific terminology. They might know that something changes but fail to articulate what the change is or why it happens. Many responses are fragmented, include unrelated information, or demonstrate a poor grasp of English vocabulary and grammar needed for detailed explanations. They often struggle with applying general knowledge to specific scientific contexts, making it difficult to link the observations to "soil health."
