REASONING: Students may struggle with recall of the correct formula, or correctly identifying the base and height from a diagram (if provided, or visualising it). They might also make simple multiplication or division errors despite knowing the formula. Some might try to use other triangle properties not relevant to area calculation. Given the low average pass rate, formula recall will be a major issue.
