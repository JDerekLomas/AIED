REASONING: Given the overall low pass rates and the struggle with basic comprehension and writing, many students are unlikely to know what an "adjective phrase" is. Even if they recognize "tiny" as describing the bird, the concept of a "phrase" and specifically an "adjective phrase" is probably beyond their current grasp. They might circle the whole sentence, parts of the sentence, or leave it blank. Some might guess "tiny bird" as a phrase.
