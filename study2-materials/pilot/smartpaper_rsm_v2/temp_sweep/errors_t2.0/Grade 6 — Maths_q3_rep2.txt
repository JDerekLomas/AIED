REASONING: Students may struggle with comparing numbers with a different number of digits (e.g., 736 vs. 3367). They might also try to compare the first digit directly without considering place value, leading to errors in identifying the smallest number, especially when the first digit of a smaller number is larger (e.g., 7 in 736 vs 3 in 3367). Given the overall low pass rate, many will likely fail to correctly identify the smallest number and place it first.
