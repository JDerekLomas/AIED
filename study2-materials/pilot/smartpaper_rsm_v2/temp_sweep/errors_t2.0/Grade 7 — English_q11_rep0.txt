REASONING: Given the extremely low pass rates on questions requiring more complex understanding and production, students will likely struggle with identifying a grammatical concept like an adjective phrase. Many might attempt to answer, but due to limited vocabulary and grasp of sentence structure, they may struggle to pinpoint just "tiny" or they might identify the entire "tiny bird" as an adjective phrase or just "bird" or the verb "built".
