REASONING: Given the high percentage of empty responses and off-topic answers on more complex questions, and the tendency to identify single words or phrases rather than full ideas, many students will likely provide fragmented or incorrect answers, if any. However, 'fairy' is a common and relatively simple word, and 'magical' also a relatively accessible adjective if it's explicitly mentioned in the text or widely associated with fairies, making the direct retrieval more manageable than complex reasoning. The "Who lived" structure also points directly to a living thing as an answer.
