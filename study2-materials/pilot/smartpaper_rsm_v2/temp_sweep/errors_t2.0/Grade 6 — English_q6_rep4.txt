REASONING: Many students will likely struggle to understand the question due to complex vocabulary ("denotes," "mentions," "most"). They may respond with irrelevant information, a generic sentence like "I like the poem," or leave it blank, mirroring the issues seen with the "poet's writing style" question. The low pass rates for similar questions indicate difficulty with comprehension and providing specific, relevant answers. Even if they understand the question, articulating a *reason* why they like a specific line in English, rather than simply stating "I like this line," will be challenging given their limited English proficiency.
