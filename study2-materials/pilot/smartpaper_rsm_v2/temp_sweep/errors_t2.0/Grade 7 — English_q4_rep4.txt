REASONING: Based on the error patterns observed in the previous questions, students struggle significantly with answering questions that require interpretation, understanding themes, or extended writing in English. The prompt also asks them to connect a text to their "real life" which is an abstract concept that may be difficult for students with limited English to grasp and express. The low pass rates for similar conceptual questions (4-5%) suggest students will likely provide irrelevant answers, partially complete sentences, or leave it blank due to difficulties in comprehension and expression.
