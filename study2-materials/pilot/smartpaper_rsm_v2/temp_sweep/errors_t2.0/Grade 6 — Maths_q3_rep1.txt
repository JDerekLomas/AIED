REASONING: Students may struggle with comparing numbers with a different number of digits (like 736 vs. the 4-digit numbers). Some might look at the first digit and think 7 is larger than 3 or 5, not realizing 736 has fewer digits and is therefore smaller than any 4-digit number. Others may try to order from the largest digit in some way that doesn't account for place value.
