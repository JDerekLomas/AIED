REASONING: Given the prevalent issues with basic sentence comprehension and extended writing, a significant number of students will likely struggle to even understand what an "adjective phrase" is. Even if they can identify individual words like "tiny," asking them to isolate a "phrase" will be a conceptual leap. Many will leave it blank or circle "a tiny bird" or "in our balcony" without understanding the grammatical function. The concept of "adjective" itself might be weak.
