REASONING: Based on the very low pass rates for open-ended questions requiring sentence construction, and given that Active/Passive Voice transformations often involve a conceptual shift and specific grammatical rules (past participle, 'by' phrase, "be" verb forms), it's highly likely most students will struggle with this. Many may either leave it blank or attempt to rearrange words incorrectly without understanding the structure of passive voice.
