REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate) because it requires recalling specific, memorized facts. It might be slightly harder than recalling Fundamental Rights as there are a greater variety of correct answers for mountain ranges, but generally it's a straightforward recall from textbook content, similar to the 50% anchor if a reading passage was not provided (but even without the passage, the 50% item is easier if the general facts are well-known).
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55-60%
