REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" anchor in terms of recall and identifying relevant examples, but the additional requirement to "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people" makes it slightly more demanding. Students will likely be able to name two resources, but linking it to "influences the lives" might challenge some.
