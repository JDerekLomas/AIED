REASONING: This item is comparable to the "Favorite Season" item in terms of requiring personal expression and recalling text, but it's slightly harder because it asks for a specific line from the poem, which may require deeper recall and understanding of the poem's content. However, the 'why' doesn't demand a sophisticated literary analysis like the 'theme' question, making it significantly easier than that.
