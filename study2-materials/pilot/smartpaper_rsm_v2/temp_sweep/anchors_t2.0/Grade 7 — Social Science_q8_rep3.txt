REASONING: This question is comparable to the 66% anchor item ("Name any two Fundamental Rights") in that it asks for recall of specific, foundational information that would be covered in Class 7 Social Science, but with a slight addition of describing one briefly. The 50% anchor asks for 3 items and is directly from a passage, making it easier than recalling taught facts. The 30% anchor involves more descriptive writing, making it harder for simple recall. Given the topic of Rajasthan and its rural occupations, this is core curriculum for Indian geography and livelihoods studies in Social Science.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
