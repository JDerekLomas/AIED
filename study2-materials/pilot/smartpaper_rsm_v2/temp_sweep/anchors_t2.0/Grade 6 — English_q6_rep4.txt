REASONING: This item is similar to the "favorite season" prompt but for a poem. It allows for a more personal response than the anchor item on the poem's theme, reducing the pressure to extract a single correct answer. However, it still requires understanding the poem and articulating a preference, which is a step above pure recall. Many students may identify a line but struggle to explain *why*, similar to the "favorite season" where they named things but didn't elaborate.
