REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) in that it requires recalling specific historical facts, but it also demands a slightly higher level of understanding and ability to articulate a causal link rather than just listing. It's more complex than the "King's Questions" (50% pass rate) which can be directly lifted from a passage. However, it's significantly easier than "The Last Bargain" or "Archaeological Sources" which require inferential thinking or more detailed definitional knowledge. I'd expect the top third of the class to get this right.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
