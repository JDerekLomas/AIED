REASONING: This item involves basic arithmetic and time calculation. It's more straightforward than even the highest-passing English and Social Science anchor items which often require recall or comprehension of a passage. It requires a two-step calculation (hours elapsed, then total temperature increase) but both steps are simple for Class 6 mathematics students. The language is also very clear. I expect the pass rate to be quite high, comparable to, if not higher than, the 66% anchor.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
