REASONING: This question involves basic number ordering, a fundamental skill typically covered early in Class 6. While some students might make small errors in transposing numbers, the task itself is much simpler than comprehension or descriptive writing, which most anchor items demand. The partial credit for correctly identifying only the smallest number also lowers the difficulty threshold for getting some points. It is harder than merely copying a sentence, but much easier than forming original thoughts or paragraphs.
