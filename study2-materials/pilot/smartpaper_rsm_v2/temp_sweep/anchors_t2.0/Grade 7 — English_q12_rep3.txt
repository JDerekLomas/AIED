REASONING: This item is likely to be harder than "Fundamental Rights" and "King's questions" because it requires applying a grammatical transformation, not just recalling facts or finding information. It is probably similar in difficulty to the "Archaeological/Literary sources" differentiation, which also requires conceptual understanding and application, or potentially slightly harder due to the specific rule-based transformation. It's significantly easier than "Theme of poem" as it's a direct grammatical task, not interpretive.
