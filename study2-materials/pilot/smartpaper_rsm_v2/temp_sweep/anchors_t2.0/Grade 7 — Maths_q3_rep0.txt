REASONING: This question is a direct application of a basic geometric formula typically taught in Class 7. While some students might misrecall the formula or make a calculation error, the task is much more straightforward than explaining a poem's theme, differentiating historical sources, or composing a paragraph. It is similar in difficulty to recalling fundamental rights but with numerical input rather than conceptual. I expect it to be easier than the 66% anchor because mathematical formula application can often feel more 'certain' to students than recall of concepts, which often have slightly varied phrasings.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
