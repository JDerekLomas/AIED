REASONING: This question is at a similar difficulty level to the 50% anchor item ("What were the three questions..."). It requires recall of basic science concepts (decomposition) and a simple inference based on observations, but also includes a more open-ended "evaluate" component that may trip up some students. Many students will know that the waste changes and becomes beneficial, but explaining *why* it is beneficial or the *exact* changes (decomposition, manure formation) might be difficult for many students to articulate, especially the "give reasons" part. Given the common empty or very partial responses in the anchor items, I anticipate many will answer partially, or focus only on the 'beneficial' aspect without much 'reasoning'.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
