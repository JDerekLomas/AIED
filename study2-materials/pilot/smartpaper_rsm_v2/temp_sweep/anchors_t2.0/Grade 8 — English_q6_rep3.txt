REASONING: This question is comparable to the 50% pass rate anchor because it asks for a definition, which requires recall from direct instruction. However, "fable" is a core literary term frequently discussed, making it slightly easier to recall than specific details from a reading passage. It's likely easier than the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) which has two required answers rather than one simple definition.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
