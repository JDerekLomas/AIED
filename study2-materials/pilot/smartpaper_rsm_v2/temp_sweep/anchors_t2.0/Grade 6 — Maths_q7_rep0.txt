REASONING: This question is a multi-step word problem involving time and simple multiplication/addition. While the individual operations are straightforward (counting hours, multiplying, adding), the challenge lies in understanding the question and performing the correct sequence of steps. Many students at this level struggle with word problems and multi-step calculations, as evidenced by the difficulty of the English and Social Science anchor items that require critical thinking or extended written responses. The mathematical components (addition, multiplication) are generally easier than essay writing or complex conceptual understanding, but the need to calculate elapsed time *and* then the temperature change will trip some up. It is harder than direct recall (like Fundamental Rights) or finding answers directly in a passage (King's questions) but likely easier than the thematic interpretation or differentiation required in the lower-pass-rate items.
