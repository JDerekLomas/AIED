REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) as it requires recalling a specific fact, but it might be slightly harder as Harappan civilization features can be more detailed and numerous. However, requiring only one key feature simplifies it considerably. It is easier than the "archaeological sources" anchor because it's a direct recall, not a differentiation.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
