REASONING: This item is significantly easier than all the anchor items. It tests a very basic sentence structure in English (Subject-Verb-Object) which students would have practiced extensively at earlier stages and would be very common. Unlike the anchors, it doesn't require inferential thinking, recall of complex concepts, or paragraph writing. The vocabulary is also extremely simple.
