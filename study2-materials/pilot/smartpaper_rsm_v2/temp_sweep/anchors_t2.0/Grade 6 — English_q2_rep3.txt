REASONING: This question is a direct recall from a story that is likely simple and taught explicitly in class. It's much simpler than the anchor item with a 5% pass rate (which requires abstract thematic understanding) and even easier than the 50% pass rate item (which requires identifying three distinct facts). It is comparable to the 66% pass rate question (recalling two facts).
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
