REASONING: This item is likely to be harder than "Fundamental Rights" and "King's questions" because it requires applying a grammatical rule, not just recalling facts. However, it's generally easier than "Theme of poem" and "Archaeological vs Literary sources" as it's a direct transformation with fewer conceptual nuances. It's comparable in difficulty to the "Favorite Season" paragraph as both involve sentence construction, though "Favorite Season" has more open-ended creativity while this is a specific grammatical task.
