REASONING: This item tests a very specific grammatical concept (adjective phrase), but the "phrase" is actually just a single word in this simple sentence. Given the low pass rates on tasks requiring deeper comprehension (like theme or differentiation) and even paragraph writing, and considering that some students struggled with even simple recall of factual information, this item is likely to be challenging. However, it's a direct identification question, unlike the theme question, and much simpler than paragraph writing, so it might fare better than the very hardest anchors. It is probably harder than factual recall of specific rights or elements from a text. The fact that the rubric asks for an "adjective phrase" but the answer is a single word ("tiny") might cause some confusion for students.
