REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) because it requires recall of specific facts that should have been covered in the curriculum, but also has some potential for students to interpret and articulate answers differently, similar to the "Archaeological/Literary sources" question (15% pass rate), due to the 'describe in brief' part. However, 'occupations' is a more concrete concept. I expect the overall pass rate to be similar to, if not slightly higher than, the Fundamental Rights question, as occupations in rural Rajasthan would likely be a significant topic discussed in Social Science for this region.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
