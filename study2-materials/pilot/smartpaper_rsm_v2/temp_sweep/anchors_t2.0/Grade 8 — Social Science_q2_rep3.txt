REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) because it requires recall of a specific historical fact that is typically taught in Class 8, and the answer can be concise. Students will have studied this explicitly in their history textbook. It's easier than "Archaeological vs. Literary" as it asks for *one* feature, reducing the cognitive load.
