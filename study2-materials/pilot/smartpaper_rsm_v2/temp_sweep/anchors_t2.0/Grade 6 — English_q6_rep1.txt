REASONING: This item is harder than the "Three Questions" anchor (50%) and similar in difficulty to the "My Favorite Season" anchor (30%). While students can identify a line, explaining "why" requires personal connection and articulate expression, which is often challenging for this age group, as seen with the theme question. The additional constraint of a specific line and its justification makes it more complex than merely recalling information or naming a favorite season without much detail.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
