REASONING: This item is similar to the "My Favorite Season" paragraph but with fewer lines and a less complex topic (hobby vs. season's broader scope). The explicit prompts for 'what it is', 'when', and 'why' provide a clear structure. Therefore, it should be easier than the 'season' item and comparable to the 'Fundamental Rights' or 'King's Questions' items.
