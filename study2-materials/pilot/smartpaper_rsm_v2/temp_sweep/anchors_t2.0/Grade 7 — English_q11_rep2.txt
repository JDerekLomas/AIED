REASONING: This item tests a very specific grammatical concept (identifying an adjective phrase), which is often challenging for students in Class 7, especially when asked to pick it out from a sentence rather than just defining it. While it's a direct identification, the nuance of 'adjective phrase' might trip some students up, as "tiny" is a single adjective. I anticipate it will be harder than the direct recall questions like Fundamental Rights but possibly easier than interpreting a poem's theme.
