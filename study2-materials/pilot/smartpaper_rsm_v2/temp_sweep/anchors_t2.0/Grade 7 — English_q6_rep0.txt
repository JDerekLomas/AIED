REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the 'Name two Fundamental Rights' question, requiring students to recall and apply a single appropriate word. However, "poet's writing style" is a more abstract concept for Class 7, so it might be slightly harder to generate a suitable word compared to simply naming rights.
