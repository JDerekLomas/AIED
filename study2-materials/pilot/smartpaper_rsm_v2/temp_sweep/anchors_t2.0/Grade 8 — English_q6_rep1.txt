REASONING: This item requires recalling a definition, similar to the Fundamental Rights question (66% pass rate) but for a specific literary term rather than common civic knowledge. However, 'fable' is likely less familiar to students than 'Fundamental Rights'. It's also less complex than "differentiating sources" (15% pass rate) but requires more precise recall than "king's questions" (50% pass rate) which can often be found verbatim in a passage.
