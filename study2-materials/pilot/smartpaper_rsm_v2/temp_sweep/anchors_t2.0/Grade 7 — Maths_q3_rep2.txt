REASONING: This question is a direct application of a well-known formula that is a fundamental concept in Class 7 mathematics. Compared to the anchor items, it requires rote memorization and direct application, similar to naming Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate) but with numerical calculation which can be a stumbling block. It's much simpler than the comprehension or analytical tasks of the lower pass rate English and History questions. I anticipate many students will know the formula, but some may struggle with the calculation or recall.
