REASONING: This item tests a fundamental concept of parts of speech, specifically identifying an adjective, which is a common grammatical structure. Compared to identifying an "adjective phrase," merely identifying "tiny" as an adjective is significantly easier, making it comparable to identifying a subject/verb, but easier than tasks requiring comprehension or detailed differentiation. Given that many students still struggle with basic vocabulary and paragraph writing, some may misinterpret 'adjective phrase' or fail to correctly identify the modifying word.
