REASONING: This item involves a basic linear equation, requiring only a single subtraction operation to solve for 'y'. While it does introduce negative numbers, the complexity is significantly lower than comprehension-based English questions or definitional history questions. Compared to other Mathematics questions at this grade level, this would be considered a fundamental skill. Given that students can often recall direct facts (like Fundamental Rights) with higher accuracy than applying complex understanding, a direct calculation task like this should have a relatively high pass rate among math students, assuming they grasp basic integer operations. The main potential hurdle would be correctly handling the subtraction that results in a negative number, which might trip up some, but generally, Class 8 students should be familiar with it. It's similar in cognitive demand to simple recall facts.
