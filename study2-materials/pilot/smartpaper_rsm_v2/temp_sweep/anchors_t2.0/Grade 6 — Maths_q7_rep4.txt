REASONING: This item involves basic arithmetic and understanding time, which should be relatively accessible to Class 6 students. It is likely easier than the English comprehension (poem theme, "The Last Bargain"), history differentiation (archaeological vs. literary sources), and creative writing ("My favorite season") anchors, but potentially similar in difficulty to recalling the king's three questions (if they can correctly count time) or slightly harder than naming two Fundamental Rights, as it requires a multi-step calculation. Many students might struggle with calculating the elapsed time accurately or performing the multiplication/addition correctly, despite the simple numbers.
