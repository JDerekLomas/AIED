REASONING: This item requires identifying a basic grammatical component, which is a common focus in Class 7 English. Compared to analyzing a poem's theme (5%) or differentiating historical sources (15%), this is a much more direct and concrete task. It's similar to recalling factual information (66%) but involves applying a definition rather than simple recall. The catch here is the prompt specifies an "adjective *phrase*," and the rubric only accepts "tiny" (a single adjective). If students identify "tiny bird" as an adjective phrase or get confused by the word "phrase," it might reduce the pass rate slightly. However, "tiny" is clearly an adjective describing the bird, and its identification is a foundational skill. It's much harder than identifying an adjective but a bit easier than generating a paragraph.
