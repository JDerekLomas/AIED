REASONING: This question is similar to the 'theme of the poem' anchor in that it requires interpreting something about the text beyond just recalling facts, but it asks for a descriptive word, which is generally easier than a complex thematic idea. Compared to identifying rights or answers to the king's questions (which are direct recall), this requires some level of inference. However, students might struggle with vocabulary to describe writing styles, especially those with limited exposure to literary analysis. I'd estimate it's harder than recall questions but potentially easier than extracting the nuanced theme, closer to the differentiation or "My favorite season" item in terms of complexity, but likely at the lower end due to abstractness.
