REASONING: This question involves basic arithmetic operations (subtraction, multiplication, and addition) which are fundamental to Class 6 mathematics. It's an application-based problem, but the numbers are small and direct, making it less abstract than the English or Social Science questions. It is similar to the 50% anchor, but slightly easier as it's a direct calculation, not a recall of information from a passage that some students might not have fully grasped. It requires multiple steps but each step is straightforward and familiar to students at this level.
