REASONING: This question is slightly harder than naming two Fundamental Rights because it requires recalling specific knowledge about a particular region (Rajasthan) and then elaborating on one occupation, rather than simply listing general constitutional rights. However, it's easier than defining historical sources or finding the theme of a complex poem, as it deals with common societal knowledge and requires less abstract thought. It is similar in difficulty to the king's three questions, as it involves retrieving information directly taught in context.
