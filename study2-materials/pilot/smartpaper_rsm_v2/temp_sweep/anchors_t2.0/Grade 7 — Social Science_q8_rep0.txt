REASONING: This question is slightly harder than the 66% and 50% pass rate anchors because it requires specific recall of information about a particular region, not general knowledge or information easily found in a passage. However, it's easier than the 30% pass rate "My Favorite Season" essay, as it only requires naming and briefly describing one occupation, not constructing a full paragraph with multiple details. It's much easier than the "The Last Bargain" or "Archaeological/Literary Sources" questions, which demand higher-order thinking (theme identification) or more complex differentiation.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
