REASONING: This question requires historical recall and a basic understanding of cause-and-effect in historical events. While it doesn't require complex interpretation like the poem, it demands more specific factual knowledge and ability to link events than simply naming Fundamental Rights or recalling details from a short passage. The expectation to explain 'how' rather than just 'what' makes it slightly more challenging than a simple recall question. I anticipate it will be harder than recalling from a passage or listing two rights but easier than complex literary analysis or differentiation of source types.
