REASONING: This question is harder than the 66% anchor as it requires specific knowledge of Rajasthan's resources and their impact, not just memorization of general rights. However, it's easier than the 5%, 15%, and 30% anchors because the first part (naming two resources) is relatively straightforward recall, and the second part (influence on lives) allows for simple, direct connections without requiring complex analysis or lengthy paragraph writing. The challenge will be linking the resource to a societal influence in a clear way, which many students struggle with beyond basic recall.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
