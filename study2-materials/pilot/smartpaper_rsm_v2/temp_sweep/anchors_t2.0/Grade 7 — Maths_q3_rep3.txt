REASONING: This question is a direct application of a fundamental geometry formula, `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. Compared to the English literature and history questions that require conceptual understanding or recall of specific facts, this mathematics problem requires less interpretation and direct recall/application. Even the 66% pass rate anchor item requires students to *name* something (Fundamental Rights), which involves specific factual recall beyond a simple formula.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
