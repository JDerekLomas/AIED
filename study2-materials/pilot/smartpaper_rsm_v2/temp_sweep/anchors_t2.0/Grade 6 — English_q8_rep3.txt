REASONING: This item is significantly easier than all anchor items, as it tests a basic sentence structure familiar from early English learning, and only requires word reordering without requiring creative thought, abstract understanding, or recall of factual information. Compared to the 50% anchor, this is just a re-arrangement; the 66% anchor required specific factual recall.
