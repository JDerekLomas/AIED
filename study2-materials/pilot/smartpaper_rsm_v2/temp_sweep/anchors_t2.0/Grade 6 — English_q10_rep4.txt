REASONING: This item tests a basic grammar concept often covered in primary classes. It is significantly easier than any of the anchor items as it requires only recall of a simple rule for "some/any," unlike the analytical or paragraph-writing tasks which demand deeper comprehension, synthesis, or creative expression. The success rate for multiple-choice questions or fill-in-the-blanks with two clear options for a basic grammar rule would be high for Class 6 students who have had regular exposure to English.
