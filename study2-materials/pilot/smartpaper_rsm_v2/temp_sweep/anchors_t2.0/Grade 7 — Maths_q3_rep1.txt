REASONING: This question is a direct application of a basic geometric formula. While the "Fundamental Rights" question (66% pass rate) requires recall of social science facts, the triangle area problem involves applying a memorized formula to given numbers, a skill many students would have practiced repeatedly in Class 6 and 7. The difficulty is likely comparable to or slightly easier than "Fundamental Rights," but still requires conceptual understanding beyond simple recall as seen in higher pass rate anchors. The lowest anchor items demonstrate struggles with abstract concepts and comprehension (e.g., poem theme, differentiating sources). This problem is much more concrete and procedural.
