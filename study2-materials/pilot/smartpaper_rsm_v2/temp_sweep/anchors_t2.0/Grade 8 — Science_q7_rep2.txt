REASONING: This question is complex, requiring students to understand decomposition, its impact on soil, and its benefits. It is significantly more demanding than simple recall tasks (like Fundamental Rights) and even tasks requiring application from a provided text (King's questions). While it touches upon everyday observations, the scientific explanation and evaluation component make it harder than a personal essay (My favorite season). The language "evaluate if this is beneficial" also adds a layer of analytical thinking. It's comparable in difficulty to the "archaeological vs. literary sources" but likely harder because it expects applied scientific reasoning rather than just factual differentiation, pushing it closer to the "poem theme" in requiring deeper conceptual understanding and expression, though still tied to observable phenomena.
