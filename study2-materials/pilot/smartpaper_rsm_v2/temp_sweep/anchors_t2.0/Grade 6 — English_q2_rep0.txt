REASONING: This question is a direct recall from a story, similar to the "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" item (50% pass rate). However, the specific answer ("magical fairy") is simpler and less complex than recalling three distinct questions. I expect a slightly higher pass rate.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
