REASONING: This item requires recalling a specific definition, similar to the "Fundamental Rights" question but slightly more abstract. However, "fable" is a core literary term usually covered explicitly, making it less likely to be misunderstood than "archaeological/literary sources" and definitely less open to interpretation than "theme." Given its direct nature, it's easier than the low-pass rate questions but slightly harder than merely listing facts or direct recall from a passage.
