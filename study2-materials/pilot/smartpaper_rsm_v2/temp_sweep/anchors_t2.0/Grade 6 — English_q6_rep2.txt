REASONING: This item is comparable to the "My Favorite Season" and "King's Three Questions" items. While it requires recalling a line from the poem (like the King's questions from the passage), it also involves personal expression, similar to "My Favorite Season." However, directly quoting a line and providing a "why" might be slightly more challenging than simply naming a favorite season or recounting factual questions.
