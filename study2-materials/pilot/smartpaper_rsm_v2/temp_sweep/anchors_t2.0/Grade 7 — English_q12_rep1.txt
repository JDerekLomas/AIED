REASONING: This item is likely to be harder than "My favorite season" but potentially similar to or slightly easier than "The Last Bargain" or "Archaeological vs. Literary sources."

Assuming it is 1 point for the full answer, then students who partially transform it correctly will likely lose the mark.
