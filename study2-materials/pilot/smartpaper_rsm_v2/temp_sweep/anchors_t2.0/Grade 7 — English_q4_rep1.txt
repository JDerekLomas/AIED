REASONING: This item builds directly on the 50% anchor item about the king's three questions. Students who understand the questions (which 50% did) will likely find it easy to give a simple, common-sense reason why such questions are important in real life, making it easier than simply recalling the questions themselves. It is similar in difficulty to naming fundamental rights, requiring recall plus a very basic opinion/application.
