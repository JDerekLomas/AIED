REASONING: This question is similar to the 50% pass rate anchor because it asks for a direct retrieval of information from the text (a line) and a simple explanation. However, it is slightly harder as it requires personal choice and a "why", moving beyond pure recall, but doesn't demand the complex synthesis of "theme" (5% anchor) or differentiation (15% anchor). It's also less open-ended than the "My Favorite Season" (30% anchor) where students create new content. The 'why' part is often where students struggle.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
