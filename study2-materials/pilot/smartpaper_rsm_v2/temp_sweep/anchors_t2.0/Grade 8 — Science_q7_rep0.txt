REASONING: This question is at a moderate difficulty level. It requires a basic understanding of decomposition and its benefits, which is covered in Class 8 science. However, it also demands more than just recalling facts, asking students to explain the change and its benefits for soil health, similar to the "My Favorite Season" prompt in requiring a short explanatory response but focused on a scientific concept. The concept of decomposition is fundamental and less abstract than a poem's theme, making it more accessible than the 5% anchor item. Yet, it requires a little more elaboration and understanding than simply naming a fundamental right (66% anchor). It's more complex than recalling direct information (50% anchor) but less demanding than differentiating between two detailed historical sources with examples (15% anchor). The vocabulary used ("waste of plants, vegetables and fruits," "pit," "change," "beneficial for soil health") is generally accessible to an average Class 8 student. The question tests practical understanding and application of scientific concepts learned in environmental science. The prompt for a reason and evaluation adds a layer of complexity compared to direct recall. I predict a score between 30% and 50%.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
