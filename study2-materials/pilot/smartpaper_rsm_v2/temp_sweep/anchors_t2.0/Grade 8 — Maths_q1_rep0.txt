REASONING: This item involves a basic linear equation, requiring the understanding of inverse operations (subtraction to undo addition). While students may struggle with negative numbers, the fundamental concept of isolating 'y' is quite standard for Class 8 Mathematics. Compared to the language arts and social studies questions that require understanding, interpretation, and extended writing, this is a more straightforward computational task. It's likely easier than the 'Fundamental Rights' question which requires recall of specific terms, and significantly easier than interpreting a poem or differentiating historical sources. The primary challenge will be with accurate subtraction of 9 from 4, which some students might reverse to 9-4, but many will arrive at -5.
