REASONING: This item is similar to the "My Favorite Season" paragraph prompt (30% pass rate) in that it requires creative writing and personal expression, but it's simpler since it asks for only 4-5 sentences and focuses on a singular topic. It's likely to have a slightly higher pass rate because 'hobbies' are generally easier to define and describe than an abstract theme from a poem, and it avoids the factual recall issues seen in the history or civics questions.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
