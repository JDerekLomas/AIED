REASONING: This question requires historical recall and a basic understanding of cause and effect, similar to the "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) but requires specific historical knowledge beyond simply finding information in a passage. It's more complex than just naming fundamental rights (66% pass rate) and differentiation of sources (15% pass rate), as it requires a specific event's consequence. The "Last Bargain" question's extremely low pass rate indicates a challenge with abstract thematic understanding, which isn't present here.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
