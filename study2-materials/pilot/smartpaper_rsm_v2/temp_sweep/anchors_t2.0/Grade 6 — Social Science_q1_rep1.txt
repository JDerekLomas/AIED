REASONING: This question is similar in recall difficulty to "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate) but slightly easier due to more commonly recognized geographical features. However, it requires naming specific ranges, which can be a stumbling block for students who only recall "the Himalayas" broadly. The 0.5 score for one correct answer makes it easier to get some credit.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
