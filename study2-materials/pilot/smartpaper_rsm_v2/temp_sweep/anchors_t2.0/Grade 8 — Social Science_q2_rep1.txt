REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" question in terms of recalling a specific factual point from the curriculum. However, "Harappan urban planning" might be slightly less frequently emphasized or conceptually slightly more complex than basic fundamental rights, hence a slightly lower but still relatively high pass rate is expected. It's much simpler than the comprehension and inferential skills required for the "Last Bargain" or "My favorite season" tasks, and directly asks for recall like the "Archaeological/Literary sources" question.
