REASONING: This item involves a basic linear equation, requiring the understanding of inverse operations (subtraction) to isolate the variable. Compared to the anchor items, it's a direct application of a learned mathematical concept, with minimal interpretation or extended writing. It is similar in difficulty to the 'What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?' and 'Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India,' which also require recall of specific facts or direct extraction, but potentially slightly harder than the Fundamental Rights question because it requires an operation. The 'three questions' question's actual responses indicate some struggle with exact recall/transcription. However, the operations in 'y+9=4' are basic. The biggest challenge will be the introduction of negative numbers, which often confuses students at this level.
