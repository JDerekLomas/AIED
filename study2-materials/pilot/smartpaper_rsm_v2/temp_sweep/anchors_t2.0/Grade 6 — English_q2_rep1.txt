REASONING: This question is a direct recall question about a specific detail in a story. It is significantly easier than the anchor items, as it doesn't require complex understanding, differentiation, or extensive writing. The "Who lived inside the book?" is a simple factual recall, similar to the 50% anchor item in terms of recalling a specific piece of information, but even simpler because it only asks for *who* and not multiple parts of a concept. Compared to "Write a theme" (5%), "Differentiate" (15%), or "Write a paragraph" (30%), it demands very little cognitive effort beyond basic comprehension and memory. The 50% and 66% anchor items are closest in format (direct recall) but this new item is less demanding in terms of the number of elements to recall or identify.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
