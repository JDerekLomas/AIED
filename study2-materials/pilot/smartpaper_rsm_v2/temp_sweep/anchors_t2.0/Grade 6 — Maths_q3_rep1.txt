REASONING: This question is about basic ordering of four-digit and three-digit numbers, a skill typically taught and reinforced regularly in primary school. The scoring rubric for partial credit on identifying only the smallest number also suggests it's designed to be approachable. Many students would likely get the first number correct, even if they struggle with the rest of the order, making it comparable to the 50-66% pass rates of straightforward recall questions, but maybe a bit harder than naming two fundamental rights given its math context. It's significantly easier than literary interpretation or differentiating between historical sources.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
