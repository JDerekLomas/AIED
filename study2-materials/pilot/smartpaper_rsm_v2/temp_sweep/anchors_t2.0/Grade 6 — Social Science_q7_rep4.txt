REASONING: This question is comparable to the 50% pass rate anchor question (king's questions) because it asks for recall of specific facts from the Social Science curriculum, which is generally well-covered. However, the additional requirement to explain influence might make it slightly harder than pure recall, similar to "My favorite season" with more direct influence required.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
