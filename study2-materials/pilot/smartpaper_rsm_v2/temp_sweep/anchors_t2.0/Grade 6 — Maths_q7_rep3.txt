REASONING: This question is a straightforward application of arithmetic, involving calculating time elapsed and then multiplying an increase by that time. It's conceptually much simpler than identifying a poem's theme or differentiating historical sources. Most students in Class 6 will have been taught basic time calculations and multiplication/addition. The main challenge will be careful calculation, not conceptual understanding. I expect it to be easier than the 66% anchor because that anchor involved recalling specific facts from Civics (Fundamental Rights), whereas this question only requires basic math skills which are constantly reinforced.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
