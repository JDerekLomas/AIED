REASONING: This item involves a basic concept of number comparison and ordering which is typically taught and reinforced from primary classes. Students at Class 6 should be familiar with this type of task. It requires simple identification of the smallest digit in the thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones place to correctly order the numbers. The cognitive demand is much lower than all the anchor items which require recall of information, critical thinking, or expressive writing. The partial credit available (correctly identifying and placing the smallest number first) makes it even more accessible.
