REASONING: This item is likely to be harder than the 'Fundamental Rights' question but easier than the 'The Last Bargain' theme question. It requires a specific grammatical transformation which students often find challenging without dedicated practice, similar to how they struggle with nuanced comprehension (like theme) or differentiating academic terms (like sources of history). While it doesn't require creative writing, the concept of passive voice is not intuitive and can be a point of struggle for Class 7 students.
