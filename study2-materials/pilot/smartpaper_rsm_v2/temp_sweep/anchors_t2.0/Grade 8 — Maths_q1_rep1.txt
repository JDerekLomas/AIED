REASONING: This item involves a basic linear equation, which is a core concept taught thoroughly in Class 8 mathematics. While negative numbers might be a point of confusion for some, the operation required is simple subtraction. This makes it easier than the poem interpretation, history differentiation, or paragraph writing, as it requires a specific, predictable mathematical operation rather than abstract thinking or extended writing. It is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" question in terms of requiring recall and direct application of learned facts/procedures, but slightly more involved than simple recall.
