REASONING: This item is similar to "My favorite season" but asks for fewer lines and a more straightforward topic. The prompt provides clear guidelines (what it is, when, why) which should help students structure their answers, making it slightly easier than some anchor items requiring specific knowledge. It's likely easier than "My Favorite Season" (30%) as that item required 6-8 lines and this asks for only 4-5.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
