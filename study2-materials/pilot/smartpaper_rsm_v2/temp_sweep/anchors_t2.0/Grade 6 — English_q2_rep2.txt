REASONING: This question is a direct recall question about a specific detail from a text, similar to the 50% pass rate anchor item ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"). It requires minimal inference and the answer is explicitly stated in the likely source material, making it easier than theme or differentiation questions. However, the wording of the question might trick some students who aren't explicitly recalling "a magical fairy" but "a fairy".
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
