REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66%) as it asks for recall of a specific feature from a familiar historical topic. However, "Harappan Civilization" might be slightly less deeply ingrained than Fundamental Rights, pushing it slightly lower. It is harder than the "King's Questions" (50%) as it requires more specific knowledge than retrieving directly from a given passage.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
