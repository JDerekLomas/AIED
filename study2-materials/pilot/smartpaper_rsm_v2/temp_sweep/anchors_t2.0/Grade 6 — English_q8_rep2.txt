REASONING: This item is significantly easier than all the anchor items. It tests basic sentence structure, a fundamental concept taught early in English grammar, unlike the abstract theme identification, factual recall from a history passage, paragraph writing, or naming specific constitutional rights. The provided words directly form a simple declarative sentence with a common subject-verb-object structure, which students at this level often practice.
