**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding an abstract concept ("writing style") and recalling or inferring a specific, appropriate descriptive word from the text or lesson.  
- **Struggling students:** Most cannot comprehend the question itself due to language barriers. They might copy a line from the poem instead of identifying style.  
- **Basic students:** With guidance, some can recall a discussed word like "simple" if reinforced repeatedly, but many confuse "style" with theme or story.  
- **Competent students:** Understand the question and can often pick a correct descriptor from memory, though may not always justify it.  
- **Advanced students:** Easily grasp and recall suitable terms, though occasionally overcomplicate with less relevant words.  

The rubric is lenient (any suitable word scores), but the main hurdle is linguistic and conceptual understanding.
