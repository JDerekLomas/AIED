Based on my experience with this context, here is my estimation:

**struggling:** 15% full marks  
**basic:** 40% full marks  
**competent:** 80% full marks  
**advanced:** 95% full marks

**Explanation of my reasoning:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The question is short, but students must first read and comprehend it. Struggling students often fail to decode "magical fairy" from the text or misunderstand "lived inside the book." Many from Hindi-medium backgrounds might not recall the specific English word "fairy."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall from a story. Struggling and basic students may remember the concept ("a pari" in Hindi) but fail to produce the exact English term. They might write "a lady" or "a ghost," losing the mark.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric is strict ("magical fairy" or "fairy"). Even competent students might write "a good fairy" or "magic lady," which, while semantically close, might be marked incorrect by a rigid scorer, hence my 80% estimate.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Common errors include leaving it blank, writing irrelevant answers ("a king," "a boy"), translating literally to "jadooi pari" in the answer space, or misspelling so severely that the word is unrecognizable ("fare," "faery").

The advanced group will mostly recall and spell it correctly. The competent group understands but may face spelling issues or add minor descriptors. The basic group has a shaky grasp, and the struggling group is largely guessing or unable to engage with the text.
