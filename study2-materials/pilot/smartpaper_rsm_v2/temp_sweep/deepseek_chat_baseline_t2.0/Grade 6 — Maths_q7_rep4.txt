struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
- **Struggling (35%):** Many in this group would not understand the English problem statement clearly. Common mistakes include misreading “10 am to 4:00 in the evening” as only 4 hours (10 to 2 or 10 to 4 am), not converting “evening” to 4 pm, or incorrectly calculating 2°C × 6 hours. Some might add 30 + 2 directly without considering hours. Only about 15% who follow step-by-step guidance might get it right.  
- **Basic (35%):** About half could follow reasoning if explained in Hindi or with a timeline drawn. They often grasp the 6-hour difference but might make arithmetic errors (e.g., 2 × 6 = 14, then wrong addition). Partial credit scenarios occur, but for full marks as per rubric, around 50% succeed.  
- **Competent (20%):** They understand the problem structure, calculate time and multiplication correctly, and add to the initial temperature. Few errors; about 90% score full marks, with rare slips in reading “evening” as 4 am.  
- **Advanced (10%):** All can interpret and compute accurately; 100% would get full marks, often solving quickly with confidence.  

**Language and context factor:** The use of “evening” for “pm” may confuse some, but once clarified in Hindi, competent and advanced students adjust easily. Struggling students need more translation and visual support.
