**Reasoning:** This item tests comprehension and simple application, not just recall. The main barrier is language: struggling students often cannot decode the question itself ("important in real life") or locate the king's three questions from the text. They may leave it blank or copy unrelated lines. Basic-level students can recall the questions but often fail to connect them to "real life" relevance clearly, writing vague or incomplete reasons. Competent students understand both parts and can give a valid reason (e.g., "Yes, because knowing the right time saves us from trouble"). Advanced students handle this confidently. The rubric is generous ("any valid reason"), which helps those who comprehend the question.
