**Explanation:**  
- **Struggling students (10%)**: Most cannot easily read or comprehend the sentence structure. "Adjective phrase" is a grammar term they often confuse with just any describing word or the entire noun phrase. They might incorrectly identify "in our balcony" as it seems longer and more noticeable, or they may not attempt it at all. Only a few with some rote recall might get it.  
- **Basic students (40%)**: They can read the sentence but may misinterpret "adjective phrase" as meaning more than one word (e.g., "tiny bird" or "its nest"). The question’s phrasing ("adjective phrase") can be confusing because "tiny" is actually just an adjective, not a phrase. However, since the rubric accepts "tiny," those who recall that adjectives describe nouns and pick the simplest describing word might score. Common mistake: choosing "a tiny bird."  
- **Competent students (80%)**: They understand adjectives and can identify them in simple sentences. However, some might overthink and look for a multi-word phrase. Once they understand only one word is needed (from instruction or prior practice), most will correctly pick "tiny." A few may still select "in our balcony" (adverbial), hence not 100%.  
- **Advanced students (95%)**: They are comfortable with English grammar terminology and sentence analysis. A small margin of error exists due to the technicality of "phrase" vs. "word," but they usually interpret the intent correctly.
