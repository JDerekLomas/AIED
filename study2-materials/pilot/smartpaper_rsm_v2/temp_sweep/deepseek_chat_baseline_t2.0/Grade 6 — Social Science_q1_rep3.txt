**Reasoning:**  
This is a pure recall item from geography. The language of the question is simple English, but many struggling and basic-level students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may not recognize "mountain ranges" instantly or might confuse names (e.g., saying "Mount Everest" instead of Himalayas). Even if taught, recall can be weak for students who struggle with textbook English terms. Competent students are likely to remember at least two standard examples like Himalayas and Aravalli. Advanced students will recall them easily. Common mistakes include naming local hills instead of major ranges or giving only one correct answer when two are required.
