advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
1. **Language Barrier:** For struggling and basic students, the primary hurdle is reading comprehension. They might not clearly understand the sentence's meaning, confusing "tiny" with "bird" or "nest."  
2. **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This item requires both recalling the definition of an adjective and applying it to identify a single word. Many basic-level students can recall what an adjective is but may select "tiny bird" (noun phrase) as the answer, a very common mistake.  
3. **Specificity:** The rubric is strict—only "tiny" is correct. Even competent students sometimes underline the whole noun phrase by habit.  
4. **Common Mistakes:** As noted, students often pick the phrase describing the noun ("tiny bird") instead of just the adjective. Struggling students might pick "balcony" (a known word) or leave it blank. Advanced students rarely make such errors.
