struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
- **Struggling students (35%)**: Most lack basic English word recognition and sentence structure awareness. They often randomly arrange words or copy the order given. Only a few who have memorized the phrase "He is reading a book" might get it correct.  
- **Basic students (35%)**: They can recognize common words like "he", "is", "a", "book", but may struggle with subject-verb-object order. Common mistakes include "A book he is reading" or "Reading a book he is". With some effort, more than half can arrive at the correct structure.  
- **Competent students (20%)**: They understand basic sentence patterns taught in class. The task is straightforward for them, though some might overthink and choose "He is a reading book" if they confuse parts of speech.  
- **Advanced students (10%)**: This is a simple exercise for them; they grasp syntax intuitively and will almost always get it right.  

**Key factors considered**: The item requires recall of common sentence pattern "He is ___ing a ___" rather than complex reasoning. However, Hindi-medium students often directly translate Hindi syntax (Subject-Object-Verb) to English (S-V-O), causing errors. Specificity is high—only one correct answer—so guessing is unlikely to yield marks.
