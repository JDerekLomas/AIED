struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks

**Explanation based on my experience:**  
- **Language barrier:** Many struggling and basic-level students first translate the sentence mentally. "Adjective" as a grammar term is familiar, but "adjective *phrase*" might confuse them—they may look for a group of words instead of a single word ("tiny").  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires recalling what an adjective is and applying it to a simple sentence. Struggling students often miss it because they can’t isolate the descriptive word. Basic-level students sometimes choose "tiny bird" thinking it’s the "phrase."  
- **Specificity:** The rubric accepts only "tiny." Competent and advanced students know adjectives describe nouns, so they identify it correctly.  
- **Common mistakes:** Common errors include selecting "tiny bird" (noun phrase) or "in our balcony" (prepositional phrase), especially among Hindi-medium students who may focus on location or object rather than quality.
