Based on my experience with this specific classroom context and this specific grammar item, here is my estimated percentage of students in each group who would score full marks:

struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**

*   **Struggling (5%):** This group has significant difficulty reading and parsing even simple English sentences. The concept of subject-object reversal is abstract. They often confuse verb forms (is/am/are/was/were). They might write "The leaves is blown by the wind" or fail to include the agent "by the wind." The few who get it right likely do so through memorized pattern recognition rather than applied understanding.
*   **Basic (40%):** Students here can identify the main elements (wind, blew, leaves). The major hurdles are: 1) recalling the correct past tense of 'be' verb ('were' for plural 'leaves'), and 2) using the past participle 'blown'. Common mistakes include "The leaves was blown away..." (verb agreement error) or "The leaves were blew away..." (not using the participle). About half navigate these pitfalls correctly for a sentence this straightforward.
*   **Competent (85%):** This group understands the active-passive voice rule well. They reliably use 'was/were' + past participle. The mistakes here are usually minor slips or overcomplications, like "The leaves were blown away by *the* wind" (omitting 'the'), or occasionally misspelling 'blown'. The vast majority will produce the correct answer.
*   **Advanced (95%):** For these students, this is a routine application. The 5% who might miss it are typically due to extreme carelessness in copying, or a rare mental block where they might invert incorrectly (e.g., "The wind was blown by the leaves"). It is not a knowledge gap.
