**Explanation based on my experience:**  
The question is in English and requires a specific, recalled fact about the political consequence of Plassey (installing a puppet ruler). Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle to comprehend the question itself, let alone recall the precise answer. Many in the struggling group might only remember "British won" or "Siraj-ud-Daulah lost," missing the key point about political control. The basic group can often grasp the gist but may phrase it incompletely (e.g., "British became powerful") without specifying dominance over Bengal or the puppet nawab. The competent and advanced groups, familiar with the terminology and concept, generally provide the required answer, though some may lose marks for lack of clarity. Translation support during the exam would significantly alter these percentages.
