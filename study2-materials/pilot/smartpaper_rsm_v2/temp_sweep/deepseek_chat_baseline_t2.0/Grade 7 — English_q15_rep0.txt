Based on my experience with this specific item, the scoring would be as follows:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 40% full marks
competent: 85% full marks
advanced: 100% full marks

**Reasoning:**
For the **struggling** group, constructing even 2-3 simple, correct sentences is a major hurdle. The requirement to write a cohesive 4-5 sentence paragraph with three specific elements (what, when, why) is often unmet due to vocabulary gaps, spelling issues, and sentence structure problems. Many may write one sentence or copy the question.

The **basic** group can often produce the required information but with inconsistencies. Common mistakes include run-on sentences, errors in tense ("I enjoying"), or vague reasons ("because it is good"). While the core content is there, grammatical errors sometimes obscure the clarity needed for full marks as per the strict "clearly mentions" rubric.

The **competent** and **advanced** groups understand the task structure well. The **competent** group might have minor errors in articles or prepositions, but most can successfully convey all three elements clearly. The **advanced** group consistently produces accurate, complete paragraphs.

This task hinges on **recall of personal information and basic sentence formulation**, not complex reasoning. The main barrier is **language production skill**, not the cognitive demand of the task itself. A student's ability to scaffold simple sentences directly determines their success.
