struggling: 10% full marks
basic: 50% full marks
competent: 80% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students would fail to comprehend key terms like "occupations," "rural areas," or "Rajasthan" if asked directly in English. They might answer only if the question is read aloud and explained in Hindi.
2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall from the textbook. Students who have read and memorized the chapter can answer. However, struggling students often have low reading fluency and may not retain textual information without repetitive oral revision.
3.  **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric is flexible—naming any two common rural occupations from a likely list of 3-4 (farming, animal husbandry, handicrafts, mining, dairy). This benefits students who recall general ideas even if not the exact textbook phrasing.
4.  **Common Mistakes:** Students, especially in the struggling group, often conflate "Rajasthan" with their own state's rural occupations. Others might give vague or incorrect answers like "shopkeeper" or "teacher," which are present but not the *main* ones highlighted in the text. The "describe any one" part often gets skipped by struggling and basic students due to lack of writing practice or incomplete answers.

**Breakdown by Group:**
*   **Struggling (10%):** Only a handful who, despite general challenges, might have a strong memory for facts heard in class or from home context.
*   **Basic (50%):** About half would recall at least two correct terms, especially if the lesson was recently taught using local examples and Hindi explanations. Many will miss the "describe in brief" part or give a very weak description.
*   **Competent (80%):** They understand the question, have read the text, and can recall the required points. Occasional errors come from writing a poorly structured description.
*   **Advanced (95%):** Near-certain recall and ability to frame a brief description. The rare miss might be due to overcomplication or a careless omission.
