Based on my experience with this type of question and student profile, here is my estimation:

**Reasoning:**  
While the mathematical skill (comparing and ordering 4-digit numbers) is taught in Class 4/5, the barriers here are significant:  
1. **Language:** The instruction is in English. Many students, especially in the struggling and basic groups, may not understand "Arrange in ascending order" unless it is repeatedly demonstrated in class with Hindi support. They might copy the numbers but not attempt to order them.  
2. **Concept:** A common mistake is to compare numbers digit-by-digit from the *right* (like comparing ones place) instead of from the *left* (comparing thousands place first). Some students see 736 as the "biggest" because 7 is the largest first digit, ignoring that it has only 3 digits.  
3. **Specificity:** The rubric only awards 0.5 for the *first* number being correct (736 smallest). A student could get this by luck or partial understanding without ordering all correctly. This slightly raises the chances.

**Estimates:**

struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 55% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks

**Explanation:**  
7% of students' English illiteracy blocks even attempting. Another 8% struggle even if they understand, due to place value confusion. Competent and advanced groups have largely internalized the concept and can follow known question formats despite language barriers. Advanced students all know this.
