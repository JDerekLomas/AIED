competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Rationale (from teacher's perspective):**  
This task requires constructing a coherent paragraph in English, which is a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. The *struggling* group often cannot write complete sentences or stick to the topic. The *basic* group can attempt it but frequently miss one element (usually *when* or *why*) or make grammatical errors that obscure meaning. The *competent* and *advanced* groups generally understand the prompt and can produce the required structure, though some in the competent group may have minor errors in fluency. The task is based on personal recall and simple expression, not complex reasoning, which helps, but language proficiency remains the key constraint. Common mistakes include mixing Hindi and English, listing points instead of writing a paragraph, and not covering all three parts of the prompt clearly.
