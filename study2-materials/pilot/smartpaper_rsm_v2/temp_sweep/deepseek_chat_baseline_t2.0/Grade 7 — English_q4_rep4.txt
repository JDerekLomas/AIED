**Reasoning:** This item requires both *recall* (of the three questions from the passage) and *simple reasoning* (to connect one of them to real life with a valid reason). The language of the question itself is a barrier for struggling learners, who may not fully comprehend "important in real life." Many in the 'struggling' and 'basic' groups might give a reason unrelated to the king's *specific* questions (e.g., "yes, because kings are important") or fail to justify their answer. The 'competent' and 'advanced' groups, having better comprehension, can typically extract the required information and make a basic logical connection. The rubric is generous ("any valid reason"), which helps those who understand what is being asked.
