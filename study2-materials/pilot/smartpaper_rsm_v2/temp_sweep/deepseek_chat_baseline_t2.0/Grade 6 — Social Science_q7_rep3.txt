**Analysis of the question for my Class 6 students:**

1. **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. Many students, especially in the struggling and basic groups, will struggle to understand "natural resources" and "influences the lives." They might recognize place names (Rajasthan) and some keywords from the list if we've done rote memorization in Hindi/English mix.

2. **Recall vs. Reasoning:** The first part (mention two resources) is pure recall. The second part (explain influence) requires basic understanding and explanation, which is harder. The scoring rubric, however, **only awards the full 1 mark for mentioning two correct resources**. The explanation part doesn't affect the score for this mark. This is a critical detail.

3. **Specificity:** The list is specific. Common mistakes include:
   * Giving incorrect examples (e.g., saying "coal" or "iron" which are not major resources of Rajasthan).
   * Confusing natural resources with agricultural products (e.g., wheat, cotton).
   * In the explanation part, they might state a resource correctly (e.g., water) but give a vague or incorrect influence due to language/understanding issues.

4. **Performance Prediction:** Since the score depends solely on recalling two correct names from a studied list, the advanced and most competent students will recall them. Basic students might recall one easily, but listing a second correct one is less certain. Struggling students often have very poor retention and may not recall the specific terms in English.

**Given the rubric focuses only on listing two resources, and based on my experience with similar recall-based questions:**

struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks

**Explanation:** The 10% in the struggling group are those who can reliably memorize a short list. The 60% in the basic group reflects that more than half can recall two items, but a significant portion will mix up one or write an incorrect second example. The near-perfect scores for competent/advanced groups are because this is a straightforward recall task for them. If the score included the explanation, the percentages, especially for basic and struggling, would be dramatically lower.
