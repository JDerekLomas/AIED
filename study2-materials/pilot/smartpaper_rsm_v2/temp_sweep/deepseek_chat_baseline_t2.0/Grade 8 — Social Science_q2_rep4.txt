Based on my experience with this class profile, here is my estimated breakdown:

**struggling: 20% full marks**  
While this is a core, frequently taught fact, students in this group struggle significantly with recall under pressure. The English phrasing of the question and the need to produce a specific, correctly spelled term (e.g., "drainage system," "grid layout") are major hurdles. They might recall a related idea ("they had good bathrooms") but fail to articulate it as a formal "key feature."

**basic: 60% full marks**  
This group has generally grasped the main facts. The topic is emphasized repeatedly in lessons and textbooks. However, language remains a barrier; some might understand the concept but express it in simpler, non-textbook Hindi-influenced English ("brick drains," "streets in lines") which, while demonstrating knowledge, may lack the precision ("advanced drainage system," "grid pattern") to confidently guarantee full marks from all examiners.

**competent: 90% full marks**  
These students consistently engage with the material and have developed strategies to overcome language barriers. They are adept at recalling and reproducing the standard textbook phrases for such key features. The occasional mark lost here would be due to minor spelling errors or unexpected blanking in an exam setting, not a lack of understanding.

**advanced: 100% full marks**  
This is straightforward recall of fundamental knowledge for them. They can answer this accurately in multiple ways and are not hindered by the English medium of the question. They reliably produce textbook-perfect answers.
