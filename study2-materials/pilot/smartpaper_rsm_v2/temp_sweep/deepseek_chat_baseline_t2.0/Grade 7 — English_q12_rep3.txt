Based on my experience with Class 7 students from the described background, here is my estimated percentage for each group scoring full marks on this specific item.

**struggling: 5% full marks**
For students significantly struggling, the concepts of subject-verb-object and their reordering in passive voice are very abstract. The use of the past participle ("blown") and the auxiliary verb "were" is a major hurdle. Common mistakes include writing "The leaves is blew by the wind" or "The leaves blown away the wind." Many may not attempt or will copy the original sentence.

**basic: 35% full marks**
Students at the basic level have a chance if they have been taught the rule recently and can recall the structure. They understand the need to move "the leaves" to the front, but often make errors in the verb form, writing "The leaves was blown away by the wind" (subject-verb agreement error) or "The leaves were blow away by the wind." The specificity of "were blown away" is the main challenge.

**competent: 75% full marks**
Competent students have grasped the general formula for passive voice in simple past tense. They can reason through the transformation. The required answer is specific, but they are likely to produce it correctly. Occasional mistakes might be minor spelling errors or omitting "by the wind," but most will get the core structure right.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
Advanced students in this context are familiar with such transformations. This is a straightforward, rule-based question for them. The only reasons for not getting full marks would be extreme carelessness or a momentary lapse in recalling the past participle of "blow." They consistently apply the rule accurately.
