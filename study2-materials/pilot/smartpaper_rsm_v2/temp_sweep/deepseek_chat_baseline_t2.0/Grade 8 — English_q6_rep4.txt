**Explanation:**  
The question requires a specific, memorized definition in English. **Struggling students** (35%) face severe language barriers; even if they understand the concept of a fable orally in Hindi, framing the precise English definition from recall is very difficult. **Basic students** (35%) can often recall the core idea ("short story with animals and moral") but may miss key terms like "typically" or "characters," or express it incompletely, so only around 40% would state it exactly as per the rubric. **Competent students** (20%) are familiar with textbook definitions and can reproduce them accurately, though some may still paraphrase loosely. **Advanced students** (10%) have strong recall and language skills to match the rubric precisely, with only occasional slips.
