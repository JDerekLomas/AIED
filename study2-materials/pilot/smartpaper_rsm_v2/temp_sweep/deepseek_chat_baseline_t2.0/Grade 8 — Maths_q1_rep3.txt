**Explanation based on teaching experience:**  

- **Language barrier:** Though the equation is short and numbers are universal, some struggling students may not understand “find the value of `y`” or the plus and equal signs if taught only in Hindi symbols earlier.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires understanding inverse operations (`y = 4 – 9`). Struggling students often add instead of subtract or ignore negative results, thinking “it can’t be less than zero.”  
- **Common mistakes:** Writing `y = 13` (adding 9 and 4), leaving blank, or writing `y = 5` (ignoring the negative after doing 9 – 4).  
- **Specificity of answer:** Only `y = -5` is correct. Many basic-level students might reach `-5` but then doubt if it’s allowed, so not all who understand will write it confidently.  
- **Advanced group:** Almost all get it, but a few might make careless copying errors.
