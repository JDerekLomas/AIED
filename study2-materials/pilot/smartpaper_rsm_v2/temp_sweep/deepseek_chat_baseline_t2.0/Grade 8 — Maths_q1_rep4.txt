struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation of reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The equation is short with numbers and basic symbols, so even Hindi-medium students with limited English can often decode "y + 9 = 4". The main barrier is conceptual, not linguistic.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires understanding inverse operations (subtraction to isolate y) and handling integers (negative result). Struggling students often forget to apply inverse operations correctly or are unsettled by negative answers.  
- **Specificity of answer:** Only one correct answer (−5), so no partial credit. Common mistakes: answering 13 (adding 9 and 4), answering 5 (ignoring the sign), or leaving it blank.  
- **Experience with similar items:** Many struggling students have not internalized that subtraction is the inverse of addition in such equations, and negative numbers remain a hurdle. Basic-level students often manage it with guidance; in an exam alone, about 60% succeed. Competent and advanced students are comfortable with this pattern.
