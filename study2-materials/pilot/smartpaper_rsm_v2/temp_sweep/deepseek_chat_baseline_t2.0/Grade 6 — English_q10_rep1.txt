struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Explanation:**  

For **struggling students**, the language barrier is significant. Many cannot confidently read or process the sentence structure. The concept of "some" vs. "any" in affirmative sentences is often not internalized, and guessing is common.  

For **basic level students**, about half have been exposed to the rule that "some" is used in positive sentences and "any" in questions/negatives. However, interference from Hindi (*thoda/thodi kuch*) and lack of practice mean many still mix them up.  

For **competent students**, most can apply the basic grammar rule here. They are familiar with common sentence patterns from textbooks, though occasional slips happen under exam pressure.  

For **advanced students**, this is a routine exercise. Almost all get it correct unless they overthink or make a careless error.
