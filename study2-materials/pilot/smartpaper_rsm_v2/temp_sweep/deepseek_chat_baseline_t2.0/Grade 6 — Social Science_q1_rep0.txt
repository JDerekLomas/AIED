struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is purely recall-based from Class 6 Geography (Chapter "Major Landforms of India"). However, the language barrier is significant. Many struggling and basic-level students may understand the concept in Hindi but fail to recognise or spell the English names correctly (e.g., "Himalaya" vs "Himalayas", or confusing "Ghats" with "Gauts"). The rubric is forgiving — any two correct ranges are accepted, and even one gets 0.5 — so competent and advanced students, who are more familiar with English terms from the textbook, will mostly recall correctly. Struggling students often mix up mountain ranges with hills or plateaus, or recall only "Himalayas" and struggle to name a second.
