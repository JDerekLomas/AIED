struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks

**Explanation:**  
This is a direct recall question from a story text. For the **struggling** group (35%), severe language barriers mean many cannot read/understand the story independently. They might copy keywords from the question (“book”) or leave it blank. A few who pay attention in class or receive peer help might recall “fairy.”  

The **basic** group (35%) can follow the text with teacher support and recall major characters/events. However, they may answer “girl,” “king,” or other generic terms if memory is fuzzy, or they might write “magic” instead of “magical fairy.” About 40% are likely to accurately recall the specific answer.  

The **competent** group (20%) reads with understanding and reliably recalls key details. They should have no trouble with this item unless they make a careless spelling error.  

The **advanced** group (10%) will answer correctly and precisely, often adding extra details unless instructed not to.
