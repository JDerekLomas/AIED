struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 75% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires a specific recall of a historical cause-effect (victory → control over Bengal via a puppet ruler). Many struggling students, due to language barriers and weak recall, would either leave it blank, confuse it with other battles, or give a vague answer ("British won"). Basic-level students might recall the British won and gained power but may not specify the political control or Mir Jafar precisely, so only about 40% would hit the rubric's required detail. Competent students, with better grasp of key terms, can often phrase the required answer. Advanced students are very likely to include the exact points from the rubric. The main hurdle is English comprehension and precise recall of the sequence mentioned in textbooks.
