Based on my experience, this item presents several challenges for my students. While it asks for a personal opinion ("like the most"), it requires them to first *recall* lines from the poem accurately and then *construct a reasoned explanation* in English. The specificity of "Denotes a line" means an incomplete or misquoted line would likely score zero. The major hurdles are: reading comprehension to understand the question, accurate recall of textual content, and the expressive ability to articulate a "why" in English, which is often where Hindi-medium students stall or mix languages.

Here is my breakdown:

**struggling: 5% full marks**  
Most in this group would struggle to write a complete, grammatically intelligible sentence in English. They might correctly recall a short, repetitive line from the poem (if it's simple), but explaining "why" in English is a significant barrier. Many would leave the "why" blank or write something off-topic or in Hindi.

**basic: 25% full marks**  
Students at this level can often copy a line correctly from memory. Their "why" explanation will be very simple, often just a single clause like "because it is nice" or "because it tells truth." While minimal, this could meet the rubric's basic requirement if the line is correct. However, spelling errors in the quoted line or extremely fragmented language in the reason could lead to partial or no marks.

**competent: 65% full marks**  
These students understand the task and can recall the poem well. They can form a coherent reason (e.g., "I like this line because it shows the beauty of nature"). The main risk is a vague or generic reason that isn't clearly tied to the specific line, but most would successfully complete both parts to a satisfactory standard.

**advanced: 95% full marks**  
They consistently grasp the task and provide accurate, thoughtful answers. The rare mark loss would be due to carelessness in quoting the line exactly or overly brief justification, not a lack of understanding.
