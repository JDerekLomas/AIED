**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires a specific recall of the **political consequence** of the battle (installing a puppet ruler to establish control).  

- **Struggling students** (35%) often cannot decode the English question properly. Even if they recall the event name, they might state general points like "British won a battle" without linking it to political dominance in Bengal. Language barrier heavily affects them.  
- **Basic students** (35%) can grasp the key words "Battle of Plassey" and "British power," but may give incomplete answers (e.g., "British got Bengal's wealth") without clearly mentioning puppet nawab or political control. About 30% would phrase it well enough to score.  
- **Competent students** (20%) understand the question and recall the cause-effect; though some may express it in simple English, most (∼75%) will include the idea of control over Bengal through a puppet ruler.  
- **Advanced students** (10%) precisely answer with required key terms and score easily, barring rare carelessness.
