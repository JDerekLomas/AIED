Here is my breakdown based on teaching this class:

**Analysis of the item:**  
The question tests the basic grammar rule of using "some" in affirmative sentences and "any" in negative or interrogative sentences. For Hindi-medium background students, this is often taught as a memorized rule. However, many struggle because:  
1. They cannot read the sentence independently and may guess randomly.  
2. They confuse "some" and "any" due to literal translation from Hindi (Hindi doesn't have this exact distinction).  
3. Those who rely on recall of the rule without understanding may still get it right if they’ve memorized example sentences.

**Common mistakes:**  
- Picking "any" because it sounds familiar in questions ("Are there any apples?")  
- Not recognizing "there are" as an affirmative structure.  
- Inability to read/understand "basket" leading to panic guessing.

struggling: 25% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling (35%):** Only about 1/4 would get this correct, largely due to chance or having memorized one similar sentence.  
- **Basic (35%):** Around 60% would get it because this is a frequently drilled grammar point, but many still slip due to confusion in application.  
- **Competent (20%):** Most would answer correctly; errors would be rare and due to overthinking or misreading.  
- **Advanced (10%):** Virtually all would get it correct as it is a foundational rule.
