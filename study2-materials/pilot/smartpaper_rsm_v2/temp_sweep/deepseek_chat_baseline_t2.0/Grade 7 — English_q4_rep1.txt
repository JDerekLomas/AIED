**Analysis of Student Performance:**

This item requires students to (a) understand the king's three questions from the passage, (b) apply them to the concept of "real life," and (c) provide one valid reason. The main barriers are **comprehension of the question's English** and **the cognitive leap from recall to simple application**. Many students, especially from Hindi backgrounds, may not fully decode the prompt. Common mistakes include giving a reason unrelated to the king's specific questions (e.g., "because kings are important") or not giving any reason at all.

**Estimated Percentages:**

struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 75% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks

**Explanation:**

*   **Struggling (10%):** Only a handful who, despite general language struggles, grasped the story's core in class discussion (possibly in Hindi) and can frame a basic connected reason (e.g., "because we must know right time").
*   **Basic (40%):** Many can recall the king's questions if the story was taught interactively. The challenge is articulating a reason in English. Some will manage a direct lift from the rubric (e.g., "to know right thing to do"), which is sufficient.
*   **Competent (75%):** This group understands the passage and the question. They can reliably connect the king's goal to a real-life need, though their reasoning may be simple or paraphrased from the text.
*   **Advanced (95%):** Nearly all will answer correctly, showing clear comprehension and the ability to justify with a reason like "to be successful in our work" or "to avoid mistakes." The rare miss might be due to overcomplication or careless wording.
