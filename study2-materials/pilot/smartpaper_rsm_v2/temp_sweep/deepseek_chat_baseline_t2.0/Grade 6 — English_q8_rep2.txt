Here is my analysis based on teaching Class 6 English in a government school with the described student profile:

This item tests the recognition of a basic English sentence structure (Subject + is + Verb-ing + Object). For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the word order (SVO) is similar in simple Hindi sentences ("वह एक किताब पढ़ रहा है"), which may help. However, the challenges are: recognizing the words, understanding the function of "is" + "reading" as a continuous verb, and the requirement to start with "He" (capitalization matters).

**Common mistakes observed:**
- "A book is reading he" (mixing up subject/object).
- "Reading a book he is" (Yoda-style, influenced by Hindi structure where verb can come last).
- Missing the article "a".
- Not capitalizing "He" or using a full stop.

**Breakdown by group:**

- **Struggling (35%):** These students often cannot identify "he" as the subject or struggle to sequence words into meaning. They might randomly arrange words. Very few will produce the exact required sentence.
**struggling: 15% full marks**

- **Basic (35%):** They can recognize common words and have some sense of order. Many will get the "He is..." start but might misplace "a book" or write "He is a reading book". About half might arrive at the correct structure through trial and error or intuition.
**basic: 50% full marks**

- **Competent (20%):** They understand basic sentence structure and subject-verb agreement. Most will get this correct, though some may overlook capitalization or the article. The rubric is specific, so minor errors would cost the mark.
**competent: 85% full marks**

- **Advanced (10%):** They grasp grammar rules explicitly. This item is straightforward for them.
**advanced: 95% full marks**

**Final Answer:**
struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks
