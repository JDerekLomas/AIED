**Analysis of the Question and Student Context:**

The question is in English, asking for recall of a specific fact from a well-covered topic in History (Harappan Civilization). While the core concept is straightforward, the language of the question itself is a barrier. Many students, especially in the struggling and basic groups, will need the question read aloud and explained in Hindi. The answer requires precise recall of a "key feature" as per the textbook. Common mistakes include giving vague answers ("they were good builders"), mixing up features of other civilizations, or correctly identifying a feature (like "drainage") but not describing it adequately ("they had drains").

**Estimated Percentages:**

struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**

*   **Struggling (15%):** Only a small portion of this group, likely those who can recall the Hindi term for a major feature like "nalee pranali" (drainage system) when prompted, will articulate it in a way that meets the scoring rubric. Many will leave it blank or write an incorrect or irrelevant point.
*   **Basic (50%):** About half of this group can recall one correct feature if the question is translated and they are thinking of the most prominent points (like the grid system or citadel). However, they might not frame it precisely (e.g., "divided into two parts" instead of "citadel and lower town"), which could lead to partial or no marks depending on strictness.
*   **Competent (85%):** Most students at this level understand the key features and can recall at least one correctly, even if expressing it in simple English or through hybrid (Hinglish) terms. They are less likely to make vague mistakes.
*   **Advanced (95%):** Nearly all will answer correctly and often provide a well-stated, textbook-style answer. The rare 5% margin is for exam-day slips or overcomplicating the answer.
