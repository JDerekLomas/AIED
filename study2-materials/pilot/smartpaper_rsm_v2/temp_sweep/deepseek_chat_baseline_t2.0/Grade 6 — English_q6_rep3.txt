**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both **recall** (finding/quoting a line accurately) and **simple reasoning** (explaining preference). Even though the reasoning is personal, students often struggle to express "why" in English due to language barriers and limited vocabulary. Many from Hindi-medium backgrounds might recall a line but give a vague or poorly structured reason (e.g., "I like it because it is nice"), which may not fully meet the rubric's requirement to "mention why." The competent and advanced groups are more likely to form a complete sentence with a clear reason. Struggling students might not even attempt the "why" part or may copy a line incorrectly.
