**Reasoning:**  
- The question demands comprehension of "writing style," an abstract literary concept. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often find such terminology unfamiliar.  
- It requires reasoning, not just recall—students must infer the style from the poem (often unseen in such questions).  
- The rubric is specific; acceptable answers (e.g., "simple," "descriptive") require precise vocabulary that struggling learners lack.  
- Common mistakes include copying a line from the poem instead of describing the style, or using vague words like "good" or "nice."  
- Competent and advanced learners, with better English reading skills and concept familiarity, are more likely to identify appropriate terms.  
- Even advanced learners might occasionally mismatch the style descriptor, hence not 100%.
