**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students (35%):** They have very limited reading comprehension and vocabulary. The choice between "some" and "any" is often taught as a rule ("some" for positive sentences, "any" for questions/negatives), but many in this group may not recall or apply it. They might guess randomly or pick "any" because it sounds familiar.  
- **Basic students (35%):** They have grasped basic sentence structures and common rules through repetition. This item tests a familiar grammar point they have likely practiced. However, interference from Hindi (where "kuch" works broadly like "some") and occasional confusion with "any" in questions may still cause errors for some.  
- **Competent (20%):** They understand the rule clearly and can apply it to a simple, declarative sentence. Mistakes here would likely be due to haste, not lack of knowledge.  
- **Advanced (10%):** They will answer this correctly with automaticity. The item does not require nuanced understanding of exceptions or context.
