struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  

1. **Language barrier** – The question is wordy in English. Many struggling and basic-level students will struggle to decode “temperature increases by… per hour” and “time elapsed,” even if the math is simple.  
2. **Recall vs. reasoning** – This requires two steps: finding the duration (6 hours) and calculating \(30 + (2 \times 6)\). Struggling students often miss one step, especially time calculation from am/pm.  
3. **Common mistakes** – Confusing 4:00 pm with 4 hours from 10 am (answer 38°C wrongly), misreading “evening” as “morning,” or not adding the initial temperature. Basic-level students might get the time right but miscalculate \(2 \times 6\) or the final sum.  
4. **Specificity** – The rubric demands exact recognition of 6 hours for full marks, so even a correct final answer with wrong working might not score if time is miscalculated. Competent and advanced students usually handle time calculation and step-by-step reasoning reliably.
