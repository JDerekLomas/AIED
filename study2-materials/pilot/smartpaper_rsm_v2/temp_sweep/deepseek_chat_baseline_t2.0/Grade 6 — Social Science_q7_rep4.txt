**Explanation:**  
The question requires two correct recalls of specific natural resources from Rajasthan. Many struggling students have difficulty retaining such specific facts due to language barriers (English terms like "gypsum," "sandstone") and may confuse resources with general terms like "crops" or "animals." Basic-level students might recall one common resource (e.g., salt or sunlight) but often miss a second correct one. Competent students typically remember at least two from class discussion, though some may not clearly explain the influence. Advanced students handle recall and explanation with ease. A common mistake is listing incorrect or overly vague resources (e.g., "oil," "coal," "soil").
