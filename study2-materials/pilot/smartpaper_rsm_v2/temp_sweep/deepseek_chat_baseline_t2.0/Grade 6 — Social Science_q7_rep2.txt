**Explanation:**  
The question is in English but requires recall of specific textbook facts (e.g., resources of Rajasthan). Many struggling students have poor English reading skills and may not understand "natural resources" or recall names like "gypsum" or "sandstone." They might leave it blank or write incorrect examples.  

Basic-level students can often recall one resource (e.g., water, salt) but may not correctly mention two and explain influence clearly due to language and concept gaps. Competent students understand the terms, recall at least two resources from lessons, and can give a simple explanation (e.g., "salt is mined and gives jobs"). Advanced students handle language and content confidently, though a few might miss clarity in explaining "influences."  

Common mistakes: naming crops instead of natural resources, repeating the same resource type, or explaining influence vaguely.
