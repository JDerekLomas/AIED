**Reasoning behind estimates:**

1. **Language barriers:** The question is short and uses mostly numbers/symbols (`10 am`, `30^0 C`, `2^0 C per hour`, `4:00 evening`), which reduces the English reading burden. However, "temperature increases by", "per hour", and "what will be" could confuse Hindi-medium students if not read carefully.

2. **Recall vs. reasoning:** It’s a simple one-step reasoning problem (find time difference, multiply rate of increase, add to initial). No complex recall of formulas is needed.

3. **Specific answer requirement:** The rubric is clear: full marks only if they correctly calculate 6 hours elapsed. Even if they wrongly compute the final temperature as e.g. `30 + 2×5 = 40`, they would not get full marks per rubric, but in reality, in classroom practice, they might if steps are correct but arithmetic slip — but here max score 1 means only correct time elapsed matters.

4. **Common mistakes:**
   - Miscounting hours (e.g., 10 am to 4 pm taken as 4 hours or 7 hours).
   - Ignoring "pm" / "evening" and subtracting 4 from 10.
   - Not understanding "increases by `2^0 C` per hour" multiplication step, though scoring only time difference is simpler.

5. **Context impact:** Simple daily life context (time, temperature) familiar to students, so real-world confusion is minimal.

Given the scoring focuses only on calculating 6 hours, even struggling students might count on fingers; basic and above should mostly get it right. The main hurdle could be attention to detail and understanding 12-hour clock notation.

Here’s my estimate based on class composition experience:

struggling: 45% full marks  
basic: 80% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks
