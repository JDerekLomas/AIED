Based on my experience with this class profile and item, here is my estimation:

struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The item tests basic written production on a familiar, personal topic, which is more accessible than comprehension or grammar rules. However, for the **struggling** group, significant language barriers mean forming even 4-5 simple, correct sentences is a major challenge; they often write single words, copy the question, or produce incoherent text. The **basic** level students can often attempt it with simple structures (e.g., "My hobby is cricket. I play evening. I enjoy it."), but many lose marks for incomplete coverage of all three prompts (especially "why") or severe grammatical errors that obscure meaning. The **competent** group typically understands and addresses all parts, though with some vocabulary or tense errors. The **advanced** group consistently meets the rubric, with only rare marks lost for minor slips. The task relies more on recall of known vocabulary and simple sentence frames than complex reasoning, which helps those with foundational fluency.
