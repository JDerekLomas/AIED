struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
This item assesses basic number sense (comparing 4-digit numbers and one 3-digit number). However, language barriers can affect performance, especially for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds who may struggle to read "ascending order" in English.  

- **Struggling students (35%):** Many would misinterpret "ascending," miss the 3-digit number (736), or simply order digits incorrectly (e.g., comparing first digits only). Only about 10% might still identify 736 as smallest correctly.  
- **Basic students (35%):** Most understand comparing numbers by place value, though some may still make mistakes under exam pressure. Roughly 60% would score full marks here, as it’s a common exercise.  
- **Competent (20%) & Advanced (10%):** Nearly all would answer correctly, with advanced students likely solving quickly. Minor errors (like misreading numbers) are rare at these levels.
