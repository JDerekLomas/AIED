**Analysis based on my classroom experience:**

This item seems simple, but for my students, it has layers of difficulty. First, it's a purely written exercise – many struggling and basic-level students decode English words slowly. The word "reading" might be confused with "a" or "he" due to shape/size. The task requires understanding of basic English sentence structure (SVO), which is different from Hindi's SOV. However, it doesn't require recall of new knowledge; it's about applying a fundamental pattern they have heard ("He is reading"). The specificity is high – only one correct order.

Common mistakes I see: "A book is reading he" (literal Hindi structure translation), "He a book reading is" (jumbling verb 'is'), or simply putting words in the order given.

**Estimated percentage scoring full marks:**

struggling: **15% full marks**  
basic: **55% full marks**  
competent: **90% full marks**  
advanced: **100% full marks**

**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling (15%):** Only a handful with slightly stronger aural familiarity or guess the common pattern correctly. Most will jumble, leave words out, or copy the given order.  
- **Basic (55%):** Just over half can apply the common 'He is + verb-ing' pattern they've practiced orally. Many will get the 'He is reading' part right but might misplace 'a book' (e.g., "He is a book reading").  
- **Competent (90%):** They understand the SVO structure clearly. Occasional careless mistakes or overthinking might cause 1 in 10 to err.  
- **Advanced (100%):** This is a straightforward task for them; they'd find it easy.
