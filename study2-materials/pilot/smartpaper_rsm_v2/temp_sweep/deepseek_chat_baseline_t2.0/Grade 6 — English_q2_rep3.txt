**Reasoning:**  
This is a direct recall question, but success depends heavily on reading comprehension and vocabulary. The students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the word "fairy" (might not know it or confuse it). Many in the struggling group might not be able to read the question or the original text independently. The basic group can locate the answer if the text is accessible and read aloud, but might spell it incorrectly or write "magical fair" or similar. The competent and advanced groups, familiar with the text and vocabulary, will recall it accurately.
