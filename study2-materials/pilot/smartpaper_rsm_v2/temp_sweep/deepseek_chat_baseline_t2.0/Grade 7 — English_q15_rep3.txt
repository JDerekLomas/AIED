advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**

The prompt is concrete and relates to personal life, which helps. However, for the **struggling** group, major language barriers (limited vocabulary, inability to form complete sentences in English) mean most will manage only broken phrases or copy a model. The **basic** group can often list points (hobby, time, reason) but about half will struggle to weave them into a coherent 4-5 sentence paragraph, often missing one element or making grammatical errors that obscure meaning. The **competent** and **advanced** groups understand the task structure clearly. The main differentiator is fluency and minor errors. The **advanced** group might occasionally overcomplicate or be overly brief, but almost all will successfully include all three required elements in a proper paragraph.
