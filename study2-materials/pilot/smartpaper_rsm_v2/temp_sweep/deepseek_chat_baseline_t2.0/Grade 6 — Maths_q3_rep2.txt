Based on my experience with Class 6 students in this context:

**struggling: 10% full marks**  
Students in this group often get overwhelmed by multi-digit numbers. They may misread the numbers, fail to compare digit-by-digit, or randomly arrange them. A few might correctly identify 736 as the smallest by seeing it has fewer digits, but many will struggle with the sequence.

**basic: 65% full marks**  
This group can usually identify that a 3-digit number (736) is the smallest. However, language isn't the main barrier here—it's attention to place value when comparing the four-digit numbers (e.g., confusing 3367 and 4799 if they focus only on the first digit incorrectly). About a third in this group may misorder the middle numbers.

**competent: 95% full marks**  
These students reliably grasp place value and ascending order. Mistakes are rare and usually due to careless misreading (like swapping digits) rather than a lack of understanding.

**advanced: 100% full marks**  
This is a straightforward task for them. They execute it quickly and accurately.
