struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This is a pure recall question from a likely familiar topic (physical geography of India). However, the English phrasing may be a barrier. Many struggling students might recognize the concept in Hindi (“पर्वत श्रृंखला”) but fail to recall or spell the English names correctly, or they may give only one name. Basic-level students, with some reinforcement, can often recall at least two major ranges like Himalayas and Aravalli. Competent and advanced students usually know this well, as it is a fundamental fact often repeated in class and textbooks. Common mistakes include misspelling (e.g., “Himalaya” vs “Himalayas”), naming hills instead of major ranges, or listing only one.
