struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
Though the formula is straightforward, language can be a barrier for the struggling group—many may not properly interpret “base” and “height” in English, or may confuse it with perimeter. The basic group is familiar with the formula but sometimes makes calculation errors (like forgetting to multiply by 1/2). The competent and advanced groups reliably recall and apply the formula correctly, as this is a foundational skill taught repeatedly in both Hindi and English mediums.
