struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier** is minimal here — the equation is short, numbers are familiar, and “find the value of y” is a common phrase even in Hindi-medium contexts after some exposure.  
- **Type of task:** This requires simple inverse operation (subtract 9 from both sides), not complex word problems. Struggling students often fail because they might add instead of subtract, or miss the negative sign.  
- **Common mistakes:** Writing `y = 13` (adding 9 and 4), leaving blank, or writing `y = 5` (ignoring the negative). Many in the struggling group also avoid equations involving negative results due to lower confidence.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** More reasoning-based than rote recall, which explains the gap between basic and competent groups — competent students grasp the "do the opposite" logic consistently.  
- **Specificity:** Answer must be exactly `-5`, so even if the logic is partially understood, small sign errors mean no marks.  

Advanced students handle this easily; competent ones mostly succeed except for occasional slips. Basic students have inconsistent understanding, and struggling students largely lack the concept of solving equations or handling negatives.
