struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 65% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks

**Explanation:**  
The question is direct and uses the standard formula they have practiced repeatedly. However, for struggling students, language barriers ("area", "base", "height") and confusion over the formula (often forgetting the `1/2` or multiplying base × height directly) reduce success. Many in this group also lose confidence when seeing numbers in English.  
Basic-level students have usually memorized the formula and can apply it if the numbers are simple, though some may make calculation errors. Competent students are comfortable with the language and steps. Advanced students find it routine. Since the rubric only requires stating or using the correct formula, even partial working with the correct expression earns the mark, which helps basic and competent levels score well.
