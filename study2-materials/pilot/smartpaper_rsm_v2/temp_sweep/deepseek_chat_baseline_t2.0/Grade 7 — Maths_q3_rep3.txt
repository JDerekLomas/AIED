struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning based on my experience:**  

- **Language barriers:** The question is short and has numbers, so even with limited English, students can identify “base = 8 cm” and “height = 6 cm.” Still, some struggling students may not understand “area of a triangle” if taught mainly in Hindi.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is pure recall of formula `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. Students who have memorized it can solve easily; struggling students often forget the “1/2” or confuse it with rectangle area.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric gives full marks just for stating/using the correct formula (not requiring correct calculation). This helps those who recall the formula even if they make arithmetic mistakes — but many weak students write “base × height” directly.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  1. Omitting `1/2` and answering 48 cm² instead of 24 cm².  
  2. Confusing with perimeter.  
  3. Not writing units.  

Given the rubric’s focus on the formula, many basic-level students can state it, but struggling students often recall incorrectly. Competent and advanced students rarely fail on this item.
