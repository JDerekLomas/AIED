struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
1. **Language Barrier:** The question is in English, which will immediately hinder comprehension for many in the "struggling" and "basic" groups, unless it is read aloud and explained in Hindi.  
2. **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is purely recall-based from the textbook (likely Chapter on "Human Environment – Settlement, Transport and Communication" or a regional study). Students who have memorized key points can answer.  
3. **Specificity:** The rubric is generous—naming two main occupations (e.g., farming and animal rearing) is enough. Even if they describe one incorrectly but name two correctly, they could still get full marks.  
4. **Common Mistakes:** Students might confuse it with urban occupations, or write only one occupation, or describe it incorrectly due to weak writing skills in English. The "struggling" group might not attempt or might write incomplete sentences.  
5. **Experience:** Competent and advanced students regularly revise notes and can recall textbook answers. Basic students might recall one occupation easily (farming) but may struggle to recall and write a second correctly in English. Struggling students often have gaps in even basic recall and face writing challenges.
