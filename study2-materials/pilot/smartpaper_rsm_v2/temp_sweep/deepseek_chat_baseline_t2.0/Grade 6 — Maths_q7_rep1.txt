struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 55% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The item is short and has numbers/units clearly stated, but students struggling with English may misinterpret “4:00 in the evening” as 4 am or not link it to 4 pm for time calculation.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Requires understanding “temperature increase per hour” and calculating elapsed time. Struggling students often miss the time duration step even if they grasp addition/multiplication.  
- **Specificity:** Answer must use 6 hours × 2°C = 12°C increase, then 30°C + 12°C = 42°C. A common mistake is to multiply 2°C by 4 (if they take 10 to 4 as 4 hours) or forget to add initial temperature.  
- **Mixed ability reality:** Competent and advanced students handle this well. Basic-level students might get confused in time calculation but often reach answer if guided—here, without help, about half succeed. Struggling students mostly guess or omit steps.
