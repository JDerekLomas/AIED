**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding an abstract concept ("writing style") and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive word from English literary vocabulary. For struggling learners (Hindi-medium, limited proficiency), even comprehending the question is a major hurdle. Many will leave it blank or copy a line from the poem. Basic-level students may grasp the question but often offer vague or inappropriate words (e.g., "good," "nice"). Competent students can reason from the text and likely recall common style descriptors like "simple" or "descriptive." Advanced students comfortably understand and apply such literary terms accurately.
