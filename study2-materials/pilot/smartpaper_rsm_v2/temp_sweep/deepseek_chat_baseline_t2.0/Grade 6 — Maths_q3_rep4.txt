struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This item requires comparing numbers by looking at the number of digits first (736 is only 3-digit, so smallest). Many struggling students may get confused if they try to compare digit-by-digit from left without noticing digit count differences. Hindi-medium students may hesitate with English numerals but here it's just digits, so language barrier is minimal. Competent and advanced students grasp place value logic well. However, some struggling students may see "3367" as smaller than "4799" because the first digit is smaller, and wrongly place it before 736. Given the rubric awards only 0.5 marks for identifying smallest number correctly, even partial understanding helps. I estimate about 15% of struggling students would correctly place 736 first.
