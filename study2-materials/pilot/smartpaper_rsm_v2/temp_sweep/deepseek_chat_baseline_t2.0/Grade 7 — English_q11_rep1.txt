advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
1. **Language Barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students are still decoding the sentence. Identifying a specific part of speech requires them to first comprehend the sentence, which is a hurdle.  
2. **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This item tests grammatical recall (knowing what an adjective is) and application in a short sentence. Struggling students often confuse adjectives with nouns or verbs.  
3. **Specificity:** The answer must be exactly "tiny." Students often mistakenly choose "tiny bird" (noun phrase) or "in our balcony" (prepositional phrase).  
4. **Common Mistakes:** Even competent students sometimes pick "A tiny bird" because they recall "adjective + noun" as a unit. Only the advanced are consistently precise. The structure "A tiny bird" makes "tiny" feel attached to "bird," leading to the common error.
