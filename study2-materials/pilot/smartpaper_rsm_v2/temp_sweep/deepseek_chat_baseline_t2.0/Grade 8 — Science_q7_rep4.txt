Based on my experience with a Class 8 government school cohort, here is my estimate of students who would score the full 0.5 marks on this item.

**Analysis of the Question:**
*   **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. Key terms like "gardener," "collected waste," "pit," "beneficial," and "soil health" are common in environmental science chapters, but struggling and basic-level students may fail to fully comprehend the question, especially the instruction to "Give reasons and evaluate."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires a blend of recall (knowing about composting/decay) and basic reasoning (linking the change to soil health). The "evaluate" part is a higher-order task.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** To score full marks, students must clearly state: 1) Yes, there is a change (like reduction in volume, formation of manure/compost). 2) Give a reason (decomposition by microbes). 3) Explicitly state it is beneficial for the soil (adds nutrients/humus). Missing any one part would likely lead to a partial score, not the full 0.5.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Common answers would be: one-word "yes/no" without explanation; describing the change only ("it becomes smelly" or "it rots") without linking to soil; confusing it with burning of waste; writing vague answers they can't express in English; or leaving the "evaluate" part unanswered.

**Estimated Percentages:**

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 25% full marks
competent: 65% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks

**Justification:**
*   **Struggling (5%):** Most will not decode the question fully. The few who might score are those who, despite language struggles, have strong recall from the Hindi-medium instruction and can write a fragmented but correct answer hitting the key points.
*   **Basic (25%):** They likely understand the core concept (compost khad banata hai) but will struggle to articulate a complete, structured answer in English. Many will describe the change but omit the explicit evaluation for soil health.
*   **Competent (65%):** They have sufficient English comprehension and conceptual understanding to structure a 2-3 line answer covering change, reason (decomposition), and benefit. Some may lose marks on clarity or detail.
*   **Advanced (95%):** They will easily comprehend and provide a precise, complete answer. The rare miss might be due to overcomplication or casual omission of one element.
