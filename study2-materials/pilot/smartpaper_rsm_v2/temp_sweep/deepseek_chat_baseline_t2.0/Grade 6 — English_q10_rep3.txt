**Reasoning:**  
This item tests the basic grammar rule of using "some" for affirmative statements and "any" for questions/negatives. For struggling learners, who often translate directly from Hindi ("kuch"), the interference and weak reading skills make this difficult—they might randomly choose or pick "any" as it sounds familiar. Basic-level students have some exposure but frequently confuse these determiners in writing, though they may get it right half the time. Competent learners are generally clear on this rule and can apply it in a simple sentence. Advanced learners would rarely miss this, though occasional overthinking or slip-ups could occur. The question requires applying a learned rule, not pure recall, which increases difficulty for those with limited practice in sentence construction.
