**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily identify the subject, verb, and object in English, which is essential for voice change.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires understanding of structure (object becomes subject, verb changes to past participle with "be" form, subject shifts to "by" phrase) – not just recall, but applied grammar rules.  
- **Specificity of answer:** The exact passive structure "were blown away" must be used; common mistakes include using "was" (matching singular "wind" instead of plural "leaves"), forgetting "away," or omitting "by the wind."  
- **Common mistakes:** Students often write "The leaves was blown by the wind" or "The leaves blown away by the wind," showing confusion with verb agreement and auxiliary verbs.  
- **Experience:** Even competent students sometimes miss the preposition "away" or struggle with the past participle "blown." Advanced students typically handle it well but may occasionally make careless errors.
