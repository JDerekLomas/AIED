struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** Even though the question uses numbers and simple terms, students struggling with English may not fully grasp “temperature increases by… per hour” or misinterpret “4:00 in the evening” as 4 am.  
- **Recall vs reasoning:** This requires two reasoning steps: calculating elapsed time (6 hours) and then calculating total increase (6 × 2 = 12°C) and adding to initial temperature. Many struggling students will stop after finding elapsed time or fail to combine steps.  
- **Specific answer required:** Only the final temperature (42°C) earns full marks, so slip in addition/multiplication leads to zero marks despite partial understanding.  
- **Common mistakes:** Misreading time (thinking 4:00 pm is 4 hours after 10:00 am), forgetting to add initial temperature, miscalculating 6 × 2, or incorrectly handling “per hour” concept.  
- **Experience:** Competent and advanced students generally manage both steps, but basic-level students often confuse time calculation or the “per hour” operation, and struggling students are frequently derailed by language or arithmetic uncertainty.
