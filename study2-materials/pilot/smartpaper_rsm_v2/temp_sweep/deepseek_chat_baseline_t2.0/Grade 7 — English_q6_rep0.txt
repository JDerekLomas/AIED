**Reasoning:**  
This question requires comprehension of a literary concept ("writing style") and the ability to recall or infer a suitable descriptive word. Many struggling learners, due to language barriers, may not understand the phrase "writing style" or may struggle to find a relevant English adjective. Basic-level students might understand the question but often choose vague or incorrect words (e.g., "good," "nice"). Competent students are likely to grasp the requirement and use appropriate terms like "simple" or "descriptive." Advanced students will consistently identify accurate descriptors. The low mark for struggling students reflects both vocabulary gaps and difficulty interpreting such questions in English.
