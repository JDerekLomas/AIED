Based on my experience, here is the estimated percentage of students in each ability group who would provide the answer matching the scoring rubric to score full marks.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. Many students, especially in the struggling and basic groups, would struggle to fully comprehend the words "Define," "fable," "typically," "imparts," and "moral lesson." They might understand "short story" and "animals."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall from a textbook definition. Students who have memorized the standard definition will score. Those who haven't, even if they understand the concept from examples (like the fox and the grapes), may not reproduce the precise phrasing "uses animals as characters" and "imparts a moral lesson."
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric is very specific. A vague answer like "a story with animals" or "a story that teaches us something" would likely get partial marks in practice, but for this strict **full marks** criterion, it misses.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Students often (i) confuse it with other story types (fairy tale, legend), (ii) only mention one part of the definition (only the moral OR only the animals), or (iii) describe an example instead of defining it.

**Estimates:**

struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks

**Explanation of Estimates:**
*   **Struggling (5%):** Very few would recall the complete, textbook-perfect definition due to language and memory gaps. They might write a one-word answer or something unrelated.
*   **Basic (40%):** A significant portion of this group pays attention and tries to memorize. About half of them might successfully recall the core two-part definition ("story with animals that teaches a lesson"), though phrasing may not be exact. Reaching 40% for the *exact* rubric match is optimistic but plausible for the more diligent in this group.
*   **Competent (85%):** They have the language skills to understand the question and are very likely to have memorized the standard definition. The 15% gap accounts for minor omissions or phrasing errors.
*   **Advanced (95%):** They can handle this easily. The 5% margin is for overcomplication or careless slips.
