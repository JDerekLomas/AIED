struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation based on classroom reality:**  
For the **struggling group**, even simple English word order is unfamiliar. Many would not recognize "he" as the subject or know where to place "is." They might jumble the words randomly or write "a book reading is he."  

The **basic group** has some exposure but often gets stuck with articles ("a") or the verb form. Common mistakes include "Reading a book he is" (influenced by Hindi SOV structure) or missing the article. Around 40% might arrive at the correct order through intuition or pattern recognition.  

The **competent group** understands basic sentence structure but may still make careless errors like "He is a reading book." However, most will correctly apply the SVO pattern, so a high majority (∼85%) will get it right.  

The **advanced group** will almost certainly get this correct, as it aligns with their formed sense of English syntax.
