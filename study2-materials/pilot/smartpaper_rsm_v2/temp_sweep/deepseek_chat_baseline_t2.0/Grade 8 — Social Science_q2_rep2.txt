struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning based on my experience:**

1. **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. For the struggling and basic groups, many will not fully comprehend the terms "key feature," "urban planning," or even "Harappan Civilization" without Hindi translation or prior oral explanation. They may panic or write something generic.

2. **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is purely a recall question from a textbook topic. Competent and advanced students who have memorized the key points will recall at least one feature. Struggling students often have poor recall due to lack of practice, confidence, or foundational reading skills.

3. **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric is broad, accepting any one of 4-5 major features. However, students often confuse features across chapters (e.g., mentioning "they grew wheat" which is not urban planning) or write vague answers like "they were advanced" without specifying the feature. This is common in the basic group.

4. **Common Mistakes:** 
   - Writing "good cities" without specifying grid layout or drainage.
   - Confusing "citadel" with "castle" or not remembering the terms.
   - Spelling "Harappan" incorrectly, but that wouldn't cost marks.
   - For the struggling group, many might leave it blank or write irrelevant points from other chapters.

5. **Teaching Context:** In class, we focus heavily on pictures, diagrams, and bilingual explanations (Hindi-English) for this topic. The competent and advanced students engage with these. The basic group might recall if prompted orally in Hindi, but in a written English test, their performance drops significantly. The struggling group often misses the core concept despite these supports.
