advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The question and rubric are in English. Struggling and basic students would first need to translate key terms like "contribute," "expansion," and "political dominance," which is a major hurdle. Many might not understand what the question is asking.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is largely recall-based, but requires recalling a *specific cause-effect link* (battle → control over Bengal via puppet ruler). Struggling students often recall isolated facts ("British won at Plassey") but not the consequence. Basic students might recall "British got control of Bengal" but not the mechanism (puppet nawab), missing the specific rubric point.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric demands precision. Common mistakes include vague answers ("British became powerful"), mixing up Plassey with Buxar, or explaining *how* the battle was won (Mir Jafar's betrayal) without explicitly stating the *result* (establishing political control/dominance). Competent students can connect these dots; advanced students articulate it clearly.
*   **Classroom Experience:** In mixed-ability groups, even when taught in Hindi with visuals and stories, the step of writing a precise English answer fitting the rubric filters out many. The struggling group often leaves it blank or writes irrelevant points. The basic group attempts but lacks the vocabulary or clarity for full marks as per the strict scoring guideline.
