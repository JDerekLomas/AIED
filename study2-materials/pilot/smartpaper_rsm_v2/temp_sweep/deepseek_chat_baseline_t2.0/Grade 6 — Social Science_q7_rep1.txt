**Explanation based on experience:**  
The question has two clear parts: **mentioning** two resources and **explaining** one's influence. Many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds struggle with the English terms (e.g., "Gypsum," "Sandstone") even if they know the local examples (e.g., "Namak" for salt, "Pawan" for wind).  

- **Struggling students (35%):** Often only recall one common resource (e.g., water) or confuse natural resources with crops/minerals. The explanation part is challenging—they might say "water is useful" without linking it clearly to lives (drinking, farming). Only around 15% might correctly name two and give a relevant explanation.  

- **Basic students (35%):** Can typically list two (e.g., salt, sunlight) but the explanation may be incomplete or vague (e.g., "for light" for sunlight without mentioning solar energy or its uses). About 40% manage both parts satisfactorily.  

- **Competent students (20%):** Understand the terms and can explain influence (e.g., "salt from Sambhar Lake gives jobs and trade"). However, some may write too broadly. Around 75% score full marks.  

- **Advanced students (10%):** Most (95%) easily identify resources like copper and marble, and explain economic or lifestyle impacts clearly.
