**Reasoning:**  
For **struggling** students, the concepts of subject-verb-object and tense (past indefinite to past participle with "were") are major hurdles. Many will not attempt it or will write "The leaves is blow by wind" type errors.  

**Basic** students might grasp the object shift ("leaves" first) but often miss the verb form ("was blown" instead of "were blown") or omit "by the wind."  

**Competent** students generally know the structure but may sometimes make agreement errors ("was blown" for plural leaves) or spelling mistakes ("blown").  

**Advanced** students will get it correct almost always, with rare slips in minor punctuation or article usage.  

The task requires recall of the passive structure (object + helping verb "be" + past participle + "by" + agent), which is not intuitive for Hindi-medium students as passive voice construction works differently in Hindi. The specificity ("were blown away") makes it challenging for those with limited vocabulary and grammar internalization.
