advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning (as per your points):**  
- **Language barriers:** The term "fable" itself is not common in everyday Hindi, though many may know "नीति कथा" or stories like "The Hare and the Tortoise." The rubric requires a precise English definition, which struggling learners cannot articulate.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is pure recall from a textbook definition. Competent and advanced students who have memorized it can reproduce it; basic students might recall only parts (e.g., "story with animals" but miss "moral lesson").  
- **Specificity of answer:** The rubric demands *both* "animals as characters" and "moral lesson." Common mistakes include defining it as just a "story with animals" or calling it a "fairy tale." Many from Hindi-medium backgrounds might confuse it with any short moral story (kahani).  
- **Common mistakes:** Struggling students often leave it blank or write one word ("story"). Basic students might write "animal story" but omit "moral." Only those with good recall and English phrasing will score full marks.
