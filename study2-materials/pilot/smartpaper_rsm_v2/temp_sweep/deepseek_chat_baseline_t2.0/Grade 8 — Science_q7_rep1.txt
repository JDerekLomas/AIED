struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 25% full marks  
competent: 60% full marks  
advanced: 85% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
1. **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. Many students in the struggling and basic groups will have difficulty comprehending "gardener," "collected waste," "pit," and "beneficial for soil health," even if the concept is familiar. They may not understand what exactly is being asked.  
2. **Recall vs. Reasoning:** The core concept (decomposition of organic waste into compost) is taught in Class 8 (Chapter: Microorganisms; Crop Production). However, applying it to this specific scenario requires both recall and a small step of reasoning to connect the change (formation of compost) to soil health. Struggling students often fail to make this connection in writing.  
3. **Specificity of Answer:** To get full marks, students must clearly state: a) Yes, changes occur (like reduction in volume, smell, formation of manure). b) Give a reason (decomposition by microorganisms). c) Explicitly evaluate it as beneficial for soil health (adds nutrients/humus). Many students, especially in lower groups, stop after "yes, it becomes compost," missing the explicit evaluation or a clear reason.  
4. **Common Mistakes:**  
   - Simply writing "yes" or "no" without reason.  
   - Confusing it with burning of waste.  
   - Describing physical changes only (smell, color) without mentioning microbes or soil benefit.  
   - Writing in fragmented English or Hindi words, which may not be awarded full marks if the key terms are missing or unclear.  

The competent and advanced groups are more likely to overcome the language hurdle and structure a complete answer, hence the higher percentages.
