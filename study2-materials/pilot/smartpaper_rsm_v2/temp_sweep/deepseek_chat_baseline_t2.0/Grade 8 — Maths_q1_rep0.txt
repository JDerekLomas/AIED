struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning behind estimates:**  

- **Language barriers:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, but some struggling students may not understand “Find the value of `y`” or the symbol `=` in a solving context.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires basic inverse operation reasoning (subtract 9 from both sides), not just recall.  
- **Common mistakes:** Many weaker students add 9 to 4 or misplace the negative sign, giving `y = 13` or `y = 5`. Some from Hindi medium may confuse “+9” going to the other side as “+9” remaining.  
- **Specificity of answer:** Only `y = -5` is correct, so careless errors lead to zero marks.  
 - Competent and advanced students usually handle integers and simple algebra, but basic and struggling students often falter with negative numbers or the idea of isolating the variable.
