**Reasoning:**  
This question requires comprehension of an unseen text (a poem) and the meta-cognitive ability to label its style with an appropriate adjective. For Hindi-medium students with limited proficiency, the barrier is high.  
- **Struggling** students often cannot decipher the poem's language itself, making style analysis nearly impossible. A few might guess a simple word like "simple" if the poem is accessible, hence ~5%.  
- **Basic** students can grasp surface meaning but may not understand terms like "writing style." They might recall a word from a prior lesson but often mismatch it, giving ~20% success.  
- **Competent** students can reason about style if guided by examples, but may struggle with precise vocabulary. With a clear poem, ~65% could pick a suitable descriptor.  
- **Advanced** students have the vocabulary and analytical skill to identify style accurately, though occasionally overcomplicate or choose less relevant terms, hence ~95%.  

The task blends comprehension with vocabulary recall, and many students lose marks by copying irrelevant lines or using vague words like "good" or "nice."
