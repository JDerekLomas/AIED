struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This item directly tests recall of a basic formula and its substitution. However, for my students:  
- **Language barriers** are minimal here as the question uses simple English with given numbers, but some struggling students may not understand "base" and "height" terms despite prior teaching.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** It’s pure recall of `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. Struggling students often forget the formula or apply `base × height` directly, missing the half.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric is strict—only the correct formula statement or correct numerical substitution earns the mark. Common mistakes include wrong formula, arithmetic errors, or writing units incorrectly.  
- **Experience:** Many basic-level students can do this if prompted in class, but in an exam, only about half recall accurately. Competent students mostly know it, and advanced students always do.
