**Reasoning:**  
For the **struggling** group, the concept of voice itself is unfamiliar. Many cannot reliably identify the subject/object in English. "Blew" changed to "were blown" requires understanding of irregular verbs and the passive structure (be + past participle), which is a major hurdle. Common mistakes include writing "The leaves blew away by the wind" or omitting "were."

The **basic** group may recall the rule but apply it inconsistently. They might correctly use "were" but write "blowed" instead of "blown," or reverse the sentence incorrectly. The specificity of the required answer ("were blown away by the wind") is exact; even small errors (e.g., forgetting "away" or "by") would lead to zero marks.

The **competent** group generally understands the transformation pattern and can recall the past participle of common irregular verbs like "blow." They might still occasionally miss prepositions like "away" or make minor structural slips.

The **advanced** group will handle this confidently, as it involves a straightforward application of a memorized grammar rule. Errors, if any, are likely due to oversight, not lack of understanding.
