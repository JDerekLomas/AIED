Based on my experience with Class 6 in this context, here is my estimation:

**struggling: 20% full marks**  
This group has significant difficulty reading English sentences. The question requires understanding structure ("There are...") and the positive statement context to choose between "some" and "any". Many will guess or choose "any" as it's a more familiar sound from questions ("Are there any...?"). Only a few with some grasp of this pattern will get it.

**basic: 60% full marks**  
Students at this level can read the sentence and often recall the basic rule: "some" for positive sentences, "any" for questions/negatives. However, interference from Hindi ("kuch" for both) and a lack of consistent practice means about 40% might still second-guess or confuse the rule, especially if they overthink it.

**competent: 90% full marks**  
They understand and can apply the standard grammar rule with high reliability. The 10% who might miss it are likely to be casual or hasty, not due to a lack of knowledge.

**advanced: 100% full marks**  
This is a fundamental concept for them. They will answer correctly without hesitation.

**Rationale:**  
The item tests a specific grammar rule (some vs. any in positive statements). It doesn't require vocabulary knowledge or complex reasoning, but it does require explicit teaching and recall of that rule. For Hindi-medium backgrounds, the direct translation doesn't help, as "kuch" covers both. The common mistake is choosing "any" because it feels more familiar from frequent use in questions ("Any questions?"). Students who have internalized the pattern through practice will get it; those relying on translation or guesswork will often fail.
