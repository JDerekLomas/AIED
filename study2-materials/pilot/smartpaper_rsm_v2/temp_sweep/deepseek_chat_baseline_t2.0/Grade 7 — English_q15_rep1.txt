**Explanation:**  
The task requires constructing a short, coherent paragraph in English with three specific elements. Students from **struggling** groups typically lack the basic vocabulary and sentence formation skills to complete all requirements; they might write a single incomplete sentence or copy the question. The **basic** group can often state a hobby and sometimes a reason or time, but frequently miss one element or have consistent grammatical errors that obscure meaning. The **competent** group has the necessary control over simple structures to include all three points, though with minor errors. The **advanced** students easily meet the rubric. The main barriers are vocabulary recall (for hobby-related words and action verbs), structuring 'when' (using "after school," "on Sundays," etc.), and formulating a clear 'why' clause.
