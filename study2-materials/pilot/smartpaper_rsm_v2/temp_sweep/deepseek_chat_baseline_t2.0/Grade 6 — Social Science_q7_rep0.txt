struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**  
The item has two clear parts: **mentioning** two resources and **explaining** one's influence. Many struggling students, due to language barriers and weak recall, may only name one resource or give vague explanations (e.g., "water is useful"). The need to spell/name specific resources like "sandstone" or "gypsum" in English poses a hurdle, so some may lose marks even if they know the concept. Basic-level students can often name two (like water and marble) but may give incomplete or simplistic explanations. Competent students handle both parts fairly well, though some may confuse "influence" with just "use." Advanced students typically score full marks, with only rare errors in writing or explanation clarity.
