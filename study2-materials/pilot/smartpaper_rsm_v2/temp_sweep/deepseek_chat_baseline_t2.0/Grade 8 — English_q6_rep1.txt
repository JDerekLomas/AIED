**Reasoning:**
The question asks for a precise, textbook definition. Students must recall and reproduce two specific elements: 1) short story with animal characters, and 2) moral lesson.

*   **Struggling (35%):** Significant language barriers. Even if they remember the story of "The Lion and the Mouse" from class, formulating the abstract definition in English is a major hurdle. They might write one element incorrectly or provide an example instead of a definition. Scoring full marks is highly unlikely.
*   **Basic (35%):** They may understand the core concept but struggle with precise vocabulary. Common mistakes include: mixing up "moral" with "message" or "lesson," forgetting the "animal characters" part, or writing an incomplete definition. A portion (around 20%) who are more attentive or have better recall might nail both points in simple English.
*   **Competent (20%):** They have the language proficiency and conceptual understanding to accurately recall and frame the definition. However, some may still omit one key word (e.g., "short") or paraphrase slightly imperfectly. A strong majority (around 80%) would meet the rubric's criteria.
*   **Advanced (10%):** They consistently grasp and retain such definitions. They would provide a clear, accurate, and often well-structured answer, confidently scoring full marks.
