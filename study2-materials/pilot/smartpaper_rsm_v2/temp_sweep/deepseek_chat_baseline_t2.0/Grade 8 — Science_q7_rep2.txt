**Reasoning:**  
This item requires reading comprehension in English, connecting "waste in a pit" to composting, and giving reasons. Even though the core concept is familiar (many have seen composting), the language barrier hinders struggling learners from understanding the question fully. Students often miss explaining *why* changes occur or how it benefits soil health, instead writing vague answers like "it becomes manure." Competent and advanced learners can navigate the language and structure a complete answer, but basic-level students often lack the vocabulary or clarity to score full marks. The 0.5 score threshold is strict — partial answers won't qualify.
