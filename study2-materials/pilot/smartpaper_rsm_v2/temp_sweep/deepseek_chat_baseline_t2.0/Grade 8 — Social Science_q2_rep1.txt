struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks

**Explanation:**  
This question asks for a direct recall of a key fact from the textbook, which is generally covered well in the lesson on the Harappan Civilization. However, language is a major barrier. Struggling students often fail to retrieve the specific English term (e.g., "drainage system," "grid layout") even if they recall the concept in Hindi. Many in this group might write vague or incomplete answers.

Basic-level students, who grasp the concept in Hindi, often manage to write one correct key term or a simple descriptive sentence in English, securing the mark. They sometimes confuse features (e.g., mixing up "citadel" with "fort") but often get one correct.

Competent and advanced students understand and recall the specific terminology accurately. The small gap between them is due to occasional oversight or slight imprecision in wording, which advanced students rarely make. The question is straightforward for those who have engaged with the material.
