struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The definition requires recall of specific terms: "short story," "animals as characters," and "moral lesson." Many struggling students, due to language barriers and weak foundational recall, might only remember one element or phrase it incorrectly. Basic-level students can often recall the moral lesson aspect but may omit or confuse the use of animals. Competent students are likely to recall all key points, though some may lack precise wording. Advanced students will reliably recall and articulate the full definition as per the rubric.
