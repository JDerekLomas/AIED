**Reasoning:**  
The question asks for **reasoning based on recall**, not simple factual retrieval. Students must first recall the three questions from the passage and then apply them to "real life" to give one valid reason.  

- **Struggling (35%):** Major language barriers exist. Many will not comprehend "questions are important in real life" fully. They might not recall the three questions accurately from the English text. Common mistake: copying a line from the passage without linking to a reason.  
- **Basic (35%):** They can recall the gist but struggle to frame a coherent reason in English. May give vague answers like "yes, because it is good" without specifying why the questions matter. Success depends on overcoming expression barriers.  
- **Competent (20%):** They comprehend the passage and the task. Can articulate a simple reason like "To be successful in work" or "To not make mistakes." Might lose marks only for severe language errors.  
- **Advanced (10%):** They grasp the conceptual link easily and can produce a well-phrased reason, e.g., "Because in real life we also need to choose the right time and right people to succeed." Near-perfect scores.
