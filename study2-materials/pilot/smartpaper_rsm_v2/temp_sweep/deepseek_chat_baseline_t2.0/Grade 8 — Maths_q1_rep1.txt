struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
While the equation `y + 9 = 4` is mathematically simple (just subtract 9 from both sides to get `y = -5`), my students face significant hurdles.  

- **Language barrier:** Many cannot easily read or understand the English instruction "Find the value of `y`", even if the equation itself uses numbers and a letter. They might be confused by the letter `y` itself if used in an unfamiliar context.  
- **Concept of negative numbers:** This is a major stumbling block for struggling and some basic-level students. They often think, “How can 9 plus something be 4?” and may answer `5` (by doing `9 - 4`), or simply state “not possible” without proceeding to `-5`.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires simple inverse operation reasoning, not just recall. Students comfortable with “taking a number to the other side and changing sign” might manage, but those dependent on rote methods for only positive solutions often fail.  
- **Specificity of answer:** The rubric only accepts `y = -5`. Many students forget to write “y =” and may just write `-5`, which might not be awarded full marks in a strict assessment.  
- **Common mistakes:** Common errors include writing `y = 13` (adding 9 and 4), `y = 5` (subtracting but keeping positive), or leaving it blank due to confusion or language anxiety.  

Given these factors, even many basic-level students can solve it if they grasp integers, but struggling students are largely hindered by language and the negative number hurdle. Competent and advanced students typically handle it well, with rare slips.
