struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 25% full marks  
competent: 60% full marks  
advanced: 90% full marks

**Reasoning:**

1. **Language Barrier:** The question is in English, but the concept (composting) is familiar in daily life for many from rural/semi-urban backgrounds. Struggling and basic students will lose points due to difficulty in interpreting "evaluate if this is beneficial" and framing the reason in English, even if they know the process.

2. **Recall vs. Reasoning:** The core idea is recall (decomposition, compost), but the question requires connecting observation (change like smell, heat, reduction in volume) to reasoning (microbes act, organic matter breaks down) and finally evaluating benefit (adds humus, nutrients). Struggling students often stop at "it rots" without explaining "why" or the soil benefit.

3. **Specificity Required:** To score full marks, they must note a change *and* give a reason *and* state it's beneficial. Many in struggling/basic groups might only say "yes, it becomes compost" without a clear reason or might incorrectly say it harms soil.

4. **Common Mistakes:**
   - Mixing up burning of waste with decomposition.
   - Saying "it smells bad, so it's bad for soil."
   - Not mentioning the role of decomposers/microbes.
   - One-word answers without explanation, leading to partial credit only.

Even competent students may lose marks if they don’t structure both reason and evaluation clearly. Advanced students typically grasp the integrated answer structure and have better language expression to secure full marks.
