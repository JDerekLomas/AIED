**Reasoning:**  
1. **Language Barriers:** For struggling students, even understanding what an "adjective" is remains a challenge. They often confuse it with nouns or verbs. Many would not know "tiny" is a descriptive word.  
2. **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This item requires **recall** of the definition of an adjective (a describing word) and then its identification in a simple sentence. Competent and advanced students have this recall; basic students are inconsistent.  
3. **Specificity of Answer:** The answer is a single word from the sentence. However, weaker students might incorrectly choose "tiny bird" (thinking phrase) or "in our balcony" (as it tells location).  
4. **Common Mistakes:** Common errors include selecting the whole noun phrase ("a tiny bird") or the prepositional phrase ("in our balcony") because they remember the term "phrase" but not "adjective phrase" specifically.
