**Rationale based on classroom experience:**  
This question requires **recall + simple reasoning**, but the language barrier is significant. Students must first understand the poem well enough to remember and select a line. Many struggling learners cannot read English fluently, so even recalling the exact line is difficult. The "why" part requires forming a basic opinion in English, which is a hurdle for Hindi-medium students. Common mistakes include: mentioning a line incorrectly, giving a reason in Hindi, or writing a vague reason like "it is nice" without explanation. Competent and advanced students manage better because they can express a coherent reason, though only advanced learners consistently articulate it clearly. The marks are often lost for incomplete justification, not for choosing the wrong line.
