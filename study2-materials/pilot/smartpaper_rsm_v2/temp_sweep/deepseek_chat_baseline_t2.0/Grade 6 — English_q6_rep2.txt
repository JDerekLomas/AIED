**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot read the poem independently or comprehend the meaning fully, making it hard to choose and justify a line.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recall (identifying a line) and simple reasoning (explaining why). Struggling students often miss the "why" part or give overly generic answers.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric demands mention of a specific line and a reason tied to it. Common mistakes include quoting incorrectly, giving only the line with no reason, or giving a reason unrelated to the chosen line.  
- **Experience pattern:** Competent students usually manage both parts correctly, though with simple reasoning. Advanced students consistently meet the rubric. Basic students often lose marks on clarity or depth of reasoning. Struggling students frequently misinterpret the question or lack written expression skills.
