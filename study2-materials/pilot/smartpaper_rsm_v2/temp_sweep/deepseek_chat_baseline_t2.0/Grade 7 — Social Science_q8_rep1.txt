struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Breakdown of reasoning:**

1. **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. For struggling and basic students (many Hindi-medium), simply decoding "occupations" and "rural areas of Rajasthan" is a hurdle, even if they know the content in Hindi. They may not correctly interpret what is being asked.

2. **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall from the textbook (likely the chapter on "Life in the Deserts" or regional geography). Competent and advanced students, who revise notes, can recall. Struggling students often have poor retention and may not recall specific terms in English.

3. **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric requires correct names (e.g., "Agriculture," not just "farming land"). Struggling students might write vague or local terms (kheti, palan) in Hindi, which may not be recognized as the formal answer, or might list only one occupation.

4. **Common Mistakes:**  
   - Listing only one occupation.  
   - Writing general terms like "business" or "work in city."  
   - Confusing Rajasthan with another state's rural occupations.  
   - Able to describe one (in Hindi) but not name two correctly in English as per the textbook.

The advanced group will nearly all get it. The competent group might miss due to minor wording issues. The basic group has a fair chance if they recall the key terms. The struggling group is unlikely to overcome both the language and recall barriers to score full marks as per the formal rubric.
