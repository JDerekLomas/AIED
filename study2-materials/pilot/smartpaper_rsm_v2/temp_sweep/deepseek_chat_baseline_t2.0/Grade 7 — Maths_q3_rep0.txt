struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks

**Reasoning:**  
The item directly tests recall of a standard formula and substitution. For struggling students, language (English words “base,” “height,” “area”) and memorization gaps lower success. Many might write the formula incorrectly (e.g., forget `1/2`) or confuse with perimeter.  
Basic-level students often recall the formula but may make calculation errors (e.g., `8 × 6 = 48` and forget to halve). With numbers simple, about half perform correctly.  
Competent students are comfortable with the formula and arithmetic; a few may slip in writing the final unit.  
Advanced students almost always get it correct, as it is a fundamental skill.
