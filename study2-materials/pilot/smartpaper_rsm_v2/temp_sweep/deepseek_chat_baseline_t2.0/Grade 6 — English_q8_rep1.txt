**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** (35%) often cannot decode the individual words confidently or distinguish between "he"/"is"/"a". They may randomly order words or copy them as given. Some might write "reading he a book is" due to literal Hindi word-order (SOV) interference. Only about 10% may get it correct, often by guessing or slow visual matching.  
- **Basic students** (35%) can identify familiar words ("book", "reading", "he") but struggle with article placement ("a") and auxiliaries ("is"). Common mistakes: "He reading a book is" or "He is a reading book". With effort, around 40% can arrive at the correct structure after trial and error.  
- **Competent students** (20%) understand basic sentence structure (S-V-O) in English. They might initially place "reading" before "is" but can self-correct. Around 85% will get it right, with errors mainly from haste or overthinking.  
- **Advanced students** (10%) have strong syntactic awareness and immediately recognize the correct order. Nearly all will score full marks.
