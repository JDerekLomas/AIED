**Reasoning:**

This is primarily a recall-based question from a well-covered topic. However, factors affecting performance are:
- **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. While I would have taught this topic in Hindi and with visuals, the act of reading the question itself is a hurdle for struggling and basic learners, causing some to misinterpret or not attempt specific points.
- **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric accepts one of several features, which helps. Many students might recall *something* (e.g., "they had good drains"), but to score, they must clearly name/describe a *key urban planning* feature. Struggling students often give vague or incorrect answers ("they were farmers", "they had seals") not related to *urban planning*.
- **Common Mistakes:** Students frequently confuse features (e.g., mixing up citadel/lower town with drainage details) or write incomplete descriptions ("they had bricks" without specifying *baked* bricks for construction/planning).
- **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Since this is direct recall, competent and advanced students who revise can score well. The basic group has familiarity but lacks precision. The struggling group often has gaps in foundational recall.

Thus, even among competent students, about 25% may not phrase the answer to hit the specific rubric point under exam conditions, while advanced students are largely secure.
