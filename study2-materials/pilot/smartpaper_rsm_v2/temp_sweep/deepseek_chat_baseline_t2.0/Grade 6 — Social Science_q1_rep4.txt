Based on my experience with this specific student profile and question, here is my estimation:

**struggling: 10% full marks**  
Students in this group often have severe difficulty with English terminology and recalling specific names from the textbook. Many might recognize "Himalaya" as it is commonly used, but recalling a second correct name under exam conditions is challenging. Common mistakes include mixing up directions (e.g., saying "Northern Ghats"), giving local hill names, or leaving the second blank.

**basic: 40% full marks**  
This group can often recall one major range (almost always the Himalayas). With some prompting or in a direct recall question, a significant portion can also name a second like the Aravallis or Western Ghats, though they may spell them phonetically or imperfectly. Language remains a barrier, but core geography terms are somewhat retained.

**competent: 85% full marks**  
These students engage with the textbook content and can comfortably recall at least two correct names. Occasional mistakes come from misremembering less prominent ranges (e.g., confusing Vindhya and Satpura) or, rarely, spelling errors that might be marked correct if recognizable.

**advanced: 100% full marks**  
Students in this category consistently master factual recall questions like this. They know multiple ranges and provide the two most obvious ones (Himalayas + one other) accurately.
