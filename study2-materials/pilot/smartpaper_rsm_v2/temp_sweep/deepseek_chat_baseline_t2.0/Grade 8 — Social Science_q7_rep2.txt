struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question, though clear, is in English. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle to decode the term "contribute to the expansion" and may not precisely recall the key idea of **establishing political control through a puppet nawab**.  

- **Struggling students (35%):** Most will confuse Plassey with other battles (like Buxar) or only recall "British won" without linking it to political dominance. Language is a major barrier here.  
- **Basic students (35%):** Many can recall that the British won and gained something, but may not specifically articulate "political dominance over Bengal" or "Mir Jafar as puppet." Some will write vague answers like "got more power."  
- **Competent students (20%):** They understand the cause-effect and can phrase it simply, though may still miss the exact rubric phrase. Most will capture the essence of control over Bengal.  
- **Advanced students (10%):** Almost all will hit the key points, even if in simple English, because they grasp the conceptual link and remember the specific outcome.
