Based on the typical performance patterns in my classroom for this type of question, here is my estimate:

**struggling:** 15% full marks
**basic:** 40% full marks
**competent:** 80% full marks
**advanced:** 95% full marks

**Explanation of my reasoning:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The question itself is in English. Struggling and many basic-level students will have difficulty parsing "Do you think...important in real life?" They might freeze at the word "important" or misinterpret the prompt. Competent and advanced readers will decode it easily.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires **both**. First, the student must accurately recall the *three questions* the king asked (from the text). This recall is a major hurdle for struggling readers who may not have fully comprehended the passage. Then, they must use reasoning to connect *one* of those questions to "real life" and justify it. The "Give one reason" part is where many basic-level students falter, often giving an incomplete or copied reason.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric is generous ("Any valid reason"), which helps. However, students must first correctly identify one of the king's questions in their answer. A very common mistake is to **describe the king's problem or the hermit's answers instead of stating the king's three questions.** For example, a struggling student might write, "The king wanted to know who the most important person is," which shows a mix-up between the questions and the hermit's lesson.
*   **Common Mistakes:** The most frequent errors I see are:
    1.  Not reading the question carefully and writing about the *answers* to the king's questions, not the questions themselves.
    2.  Writing a generic reason like "Yes, because it is important," without linking it to a specific king's question.
    3.  Leaving the "reason" part blank or incomplete due to lack of vocabulary or confidence in sentence construction.

The competent and advanced groups typically perform well because they can navigate both the recall and the simple reasoning task. The spread in the basic group is wide; some will grasp it, while others will get lost in the language. The estimated 15% for struggling students represents those who, despite language challenges, might latch onto one key phrase from the lesson ("right time") and construct a simple, valid reason.
