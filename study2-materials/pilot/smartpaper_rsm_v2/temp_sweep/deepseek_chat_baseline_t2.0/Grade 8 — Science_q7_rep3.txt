competent: 60% full marks  
advanced: 90% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students will have difficulty understanding "notice any change," "give reasons," and "evaluate if this is beneficial." They may grasp the composting context but fail to express the required reasoning in English.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recall (knowing about decomposition/composting) and reasoning (linking change to reasons and soil health). Struggling students often lack the conceptual link; basic students might recall decomposition but not fully explain benefits.  
- **Specificity of answer:** To score full marks (0.5), students must note that change occurs (e.g., waste reduces, becomes dark matter), give a reason (decomposition by microbes), and state it is beneficial (adds nutrients/humus). Competent students can manage this if they overcome language hurdles; advanced students will articulate it well.  
- **Common mistakes:** Many students from Hindi backgrounds might only write "yes, waste rots" in simple English without giving reasons or evaluating soil health. Some may confuse it with burning waste or simply say "it becomes compost" without further explanation.
