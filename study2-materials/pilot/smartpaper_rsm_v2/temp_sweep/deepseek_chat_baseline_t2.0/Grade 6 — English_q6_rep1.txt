**Explanation:**  
This question requires both **recall** (finding/remembering a line) and **reasoning** (explaining "why"). The language barrier is significant — many struggling and basic-level students may not understand the poem deeply enough to form a personal interpretation. Common mistakes include:  
- Writing any random line without justification.  
- Giving a reason that is too vague ("because it is nice").  
- Struggling to write the explanation in English even if they have an idea in Hindi.  

The **competent** group can manage this with some clarity, while the **advanced** group typically meets both criteria well. The **basic** group might pick a line correctly but often fails to give a valid "why." The **struggling** group mostly cannot access the task due to low comprehension and writing challenges.
