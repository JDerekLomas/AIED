struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This question tests simple recall of prominent physical features of India, which is a standard topic in Class 6 Geography. However, the English phrasing can be a barrier. Many struggling students may not comprehend "mountain ranges" or "located in India" clearly, leading to blank or incorrect answers. The basic group, if taught and reinforced in Hindi/mixed medium, can recall at least one range (often Himalayas or Aravalli), but may not list two correctly. Competent students are likely to understand the key terms and recall at least two. Advanced students have strong conceptual and language clarity. Common mistakes include naming local hills instead of major ranges or writing only one name due to insecurity with English spelling.
