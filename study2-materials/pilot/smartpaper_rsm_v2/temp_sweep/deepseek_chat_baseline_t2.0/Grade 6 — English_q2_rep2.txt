**Explanation:**  
This question requires direct recall of a specific detail from a text. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited proficiency, success depends heavily on whether they understood and remembered the key term "magical fairy" during the lesson.  

- **Struggling students (35%):** Many would miss this because they might not have comprehended the story fully. Common mistakes include leaving it blank, writing "someone" or "a girl," or misreading "book" and giving an unrelated answer. Only about 20% who paid close attention might recall the exact phrase.  
- **Basic students (35%):** They likely grasped the main idea of the story. The challenge is recalling the precise noun phrase. Some might write "fairy" (accepted) or "a fairy." I estimate 60% would get it right.  
- **Competent (20%) and Advanced (10%):** These students have better reading comprehension and vocabulary retention. They will recall the detail accurately, with near-perfect scores, barring occasional slips in spelling.
