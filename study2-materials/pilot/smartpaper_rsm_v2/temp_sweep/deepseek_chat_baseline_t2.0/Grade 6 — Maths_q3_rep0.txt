Here is my reasoning based on teaching Class 6 in a Hindi-medium government school context.

**Thinking process:**

1. **Language barriers:** The question is written only in English. Many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may not understand "Arrange in ascending order." However, the mathematical notation `3367, 5492, 736, 4799` is universal. Often, teachers explain and demonstrate "chhote se bada" (small to big) in class before such exercises. Students who miss the instruction due to language might still recognize the task from format.

2. **Concept needed:** This requires comparing **place value** of numbers (4-digit vs 3-digit). The key is noticing that 736 is the only 3-digit number, so it’s smallest. Remaining comparison of 4-digit numbers requires looking at thousands place (3, 5, 4 → so 3367, then 4799, then 5492).

3. **Recall vs reasoning:** Pure numerical reasoning — no formulas or procedures to recall except understanding place value and ordering.

4. **Common mistakes:**
   - Misreading ascending as descending.
   - Ignoring place value and comparing only first digit wrongly (thinking 736 is biggest because 7 is largest first digit).
   - Copying numbers incorrectly in answer.
   - Not seeing that 736 is 3-digit, so treating all as 4-digit and getting confused.
   - Language barrier causing them to leave blank or guess randomly.

5. **Likely success by group:**
   - **Struggling (35%):** Many will be confused by instruction in English, may not grasp place value comparison fully. Some might by luck put 736 first because it "looks different." I expect only about **20%** of this group to score full marks.
   - **Basic (35%):** Understands the concept after demonstration, can follow steps if they recall the method. Might make careless errors in ordering the 4-digit numbers, but likely to get the first number right. About **60%** likely to get full marks.
   - **Competent (20%):** Clear with concept, can read enough English to understand "ascending order." Possibly small slip-ups but mostly correct. Around **85%** success rate.
   - **Advanced (10%):** Will find this very straightforward; may only make errors if they rush. Close to **95%** success.

struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks
