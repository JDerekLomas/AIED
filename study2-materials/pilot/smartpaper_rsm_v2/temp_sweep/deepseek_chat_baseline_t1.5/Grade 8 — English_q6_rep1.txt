**Reasoning:**  
The item requires precise recall of a specific literary term definition. The rubric demands *both* key elements: "animals as characters" and "moral lesson." Many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may understand the concept of a *kahani* with a *sikh*, but the English vocabulary ("fable," "moral," "characters") is a barrier.  

- **Struggling:** Most will not recall the exact English terms; they might say "story with animals" but omit "moral lesson," or confuse it with other story types.  
- **Basic:** A significant portion can recall one element, but often miss the second (especially specifying animals). Some will write "short story with a lesson" and lose the mark.  
- **Competent:** Most have the concept and vocabulary, but a few may still be imprecise under exam pressure.  
- **Advanced:** Near-perfect recall, though rare slips in wording may occur.
