**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: **recalling** the three questions from the text (which is challenging for those with language/reading barriers) and then applying **simple reasoning** to connect any one of them to real-life importance. The rubric is generous ("any valid reason"), so the main hurdle is comprehension of the question and recall of the king's questions.  

- **Struggling students (35%):** Most will not decode the English question fully. Common mistakes include copying a line from the passage unrelated to "reason" or leaving it blank. A small percentage (∼10%) who listened carefully in class may recall and give a simple reason like "to do work on time."  
- **Basic students (35%):** They understand the gist but may struggle to articulate. Many will recall at least one question and give a basic reason, though some may only list the questions without giving a reason, losing the mark. ∼40% will successfully provide a valid reason.  
- **Competent students (20%):** They comprehend well and can easily recall the questions. Most (∼80%) will confidently give a clear reason (e.g., "to be successful").  
- **Advanced students (10%):** Near-perfect recall and reasoning. A few may overcomplicate or write lengthy answers, but ∼95% will score the mark.
