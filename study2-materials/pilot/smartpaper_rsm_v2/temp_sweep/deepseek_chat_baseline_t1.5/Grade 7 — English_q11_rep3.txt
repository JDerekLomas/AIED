struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
- **Struggling (5%):** Most students in this group cannot read the sentence independently or distinguish parts of speech. "Tiny" might be unknown vocabulary, and the concept of an "adjective phrase" (though here it's just a single adjective) is abstract. They may simply copy a random word from the sentence.  
- **Basic (40%):** These students can read the sentence but often confuse adjectives with nouns or verbs. They might incorrectly choose "bird" or "nest" as the adjective. However, with some classroom teaching recall, around 40% can identify "tiny" as a describing word.  
- **Competent (85%):** They understand what an adjective is and can locate it in a simple sentence. The word "tiny" is clear and familiar. Some may overthink and choose "in our balcony" as a phrase, but most will answer correctly.  
- **Advanced (95%):** They easily recall the concept and apply it. The rare error might come from misreading the question as "adjective phrase" rather than just "adjective," but the sentence only has a single adjective, so they will still pick "tiny."
