**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, but “Find the value of `y`” may confuse some Hindi-medium students. Struggling learners might not understand the task itself.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires basic inverse operation reasoning (`y = 4 – 9`), but many struggling students either add instead of subtract or cannot handle negative numbers.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  1. Writing `y = 4 + 9` → `y = 13`.  
  2. Writing `y = 9 – 4` → `y = 5`.  
  3. Leaving the answer blank due to confusion with negative integers.  
- **Specificity:** Only `y = -5` is correct; no partial credit. Many basic-level students might reach `-5` but second-guess because negative numbers still feel unfamiliar.
