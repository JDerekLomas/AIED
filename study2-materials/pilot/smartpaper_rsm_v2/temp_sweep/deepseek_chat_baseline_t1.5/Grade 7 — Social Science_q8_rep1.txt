**Reasoning:**  
The question requires recall of specific factual knowledge from the Rajasthan chapter. While the occupations (farming, animal husbandry) are familiar to many from their own context, the language barrier is significant. Students in the struggling group often cannot decode the English question properly or recall the textbook terms. The basic group may understand the gist and recall one occupation, but frequently miss writing the second correctly or describe it inadequately. Competent students usually manage both parts, though some may lose marks on brief description clarity. Advanced students handle it well. A common mistake is writing generic answers (like "business") not specific to Rajasthan's rural areas, or mixing up occupations of other states. If the question were asked orally in Hindi, scores would be much higher.
