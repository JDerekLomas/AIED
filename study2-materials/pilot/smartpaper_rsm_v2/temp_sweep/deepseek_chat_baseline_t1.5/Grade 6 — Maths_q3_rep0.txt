struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- The question is in English, but the task itself (comparing and ordering numbers) is a skill taught repeatedly in both Hindi and English mediums. Many struggling students may still get confused by the English digits or the instruction "ascending order," but the numbers themselves are familiar.  
- Identifying the smallest number (736) is relatively straightforward because it is the only 3-digit number among 4-digit numbers, so even with language barriers, visual pattern recognition helps.  
- Common mistakes among struggling students include misreading digits, comparing from the leftmost digit incorrectly, or not understanding "ascending" despite prior practice.  
- Basic-level students have generally grasped place value and ordering, so a majority would get it right.  
- Competent and advanced students are very likely to answer correctly, as this is a fundamental number sense task.
