Based on my experience, here is the estimated percentage of students in each ability group who would correctly select 'some' for this item:

struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks

**Reasoning:**

*   **Struggling (15%):** For these students, significant language barriers mean many cannot read the sentence with comprehension. The question tests a specific grammar rule (use of 'some' in affirmative statements vs. 'any' in questions/negatives). This is often taught by rote. Only a small fraction who have memorized this rule or make a lucky guess will get it correct. A common mistake is choosing 'any' because it feels more familiar or is incorrectly generalized.

*   **Basic (60%):** Students at this level can read the simple sentence. The concept has likely been taught and drilled. However, interference from Hindi grammar (where such a distinction isn't made in the same way) and lack of confident recall lead to errors. About half to two-thirds would remember the rule for a basic, out-of-context sentence like this.

*   **Competent (95%):** These students have internalized this fundamental grammar point. They read the sentence fluently and apply the rule accurately. The occasional error might come from overthinking or haste, but near-perfect scores are expected.

*   **Advanced (100%):** This is an elementary exercise for them. They would not only know the rule but could likely explain it. Full marks are a certainty.
