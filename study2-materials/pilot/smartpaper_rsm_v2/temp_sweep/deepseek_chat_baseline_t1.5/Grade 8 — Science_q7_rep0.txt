**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students would not fully comprehend "evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health" and might only partially grasp the scenario.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recalling that plant waste decomposes and reasoning about changes (smell, volume, texture, heat) and connecting it to soil health (manure, nutrients). Struggling students often miss the "reasons" or "beneficial" part.  
- **Specificity required:** To score full marks (0.5), they must clearly state *changes observed* (e.g., waste becomes smaller, turns into compost, smell) *and* state it is beneficial for soil (adds nutrients/manure). Many basic-level students might only say "it rots" without explaining benefit.  
- **Common mistakes:** Answers like "it smells bad" without linking to decomposition, or "it becomes fertilizer" without mentioning observable changes. Some may not mention soil health at all. Advanced students are more likely to give complete, structured answers even with language hurdles.
