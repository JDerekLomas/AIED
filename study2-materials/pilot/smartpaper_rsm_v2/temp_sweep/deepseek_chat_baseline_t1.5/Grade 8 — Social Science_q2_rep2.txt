**Reasoning:**  
This is a direct recall question from a well-taught topic. However, the language of the question paper (English) is a significant barrier for the struggling and basic groups. Many in the struggling group might not comprehend "urban planning" or "key feature," leading to blank or irrelevant answers. The basic group, with some understanding, might recall "drainage" or "bricks" but often fail to phrase it as a complete "key feature" (e.g., writing only "drains" instead of "advanced drainage system"). The competent and advanced groups are familiar with the expected textbook phrases and can recall and write them correctly, though a few in the competent group may still make spelling or incomplete phrasing errors. The advanced group will typically answer accurately and completely.
