struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The item is short and numbers are universal, but some struggling students may not recall the English word "area" or "base × height" if taught bilingually. However, since the formula is directly stated in the rubric, partial understanding could still earn marks.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is pure recall of a basic formula (`1/2 × b × h`), which is heavily practiced in Class 6 and 7. Most students beyond the struggling level have memorized it.  
- **Specificity:** The answer requires only stating or using the formula—no calculation is needed for the score. This makes it accessible even for those weak in arithmetic.  
- **Common mistakes:** Struggling students often confuse the formula with that of a rectangle (`base × height`), omit the `1/2`, or cannot recall the term "area" in English. Basic-level students may recall correctly but sometimes write incorrect multiplication (e.g., `1/2 × 8 × 6` but then miscompute). However, since the rubric only requires stating/using the formula, not the correct numerical answer, even those with calculation errors could score full marks if they write the correct formula.  

Given the rubric’s focus on formula recall rather than final answer, many basic and most competent/advanced students will score full marks. Struggling students have a lower rate due to memory gaps and language anxiety.
