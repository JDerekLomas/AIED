**Reasoning:**  
This item requires basic sentence structure understanding (S-V-O) in English. For **struggling** students (many from Hindi-medium backgrounds), English word order is a major hurdle as Hindi follows S-O-V pattern. They often jumble the article or verb placement. Only a few might recall the correct pattern.  

**Basic** level students have some exposure and can often sequence known words, but may still make mistakes like placing "a" incorrectly (e.g., "He a is reading book"). With focused practice, more than half can get it right.  

**Competent** students grasp English word order well and will mostly arrange correctly, though occasional slips may happen.  

**Advanced** students will find this straightforward and consistently correct.
