**Reasoning:**  
This item tests the basic grammar rule of using "some" in positive statements and "any" in questions or negatives. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the concept of countable nouns in affirmative sentences is often taught by rote, but application is challenging.  

- **Struggling students (35%):** Most cannot read the sentence fluently. Even if they decode it, they often confuse "some" and "any" due to literal Hindi translation ("kuch" for both) and lack of exposure. Only a few who have memorized the rule might answer correctly.  
- **Basic students (35%):** About half can apply the rule when the sentence is clearly affirmative. Common mistakes include choosing "any" because it feels more familiar from questions ("Are there any apples?").  
- **Competent (20%):** They understand the pattern well and rarely make mistakes here unless they rush.  
- **Advanced (10%):** They will get this correct consistently as it is a foundational concept.
