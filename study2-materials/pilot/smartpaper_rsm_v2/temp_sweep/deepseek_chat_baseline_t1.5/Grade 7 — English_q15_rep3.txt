**Reasoning:**  
The task requires constructing a simple paragraph, which is a recall and production exercise rather than complex reasoning. However, for the struggling group, significant language barriers, lack of vocabulary, and difficulty in forming complete sentences in English mean most will omit one or more required elements (hobby, time, reason). The basic group can often write simple sentences but may struggle with clarity on "why" or correct tense usage. The competent and advanced groups are generally able to meet all rubric points, though minor grammatical errors in the competent group may occasionally obscure meaning. A common mistake across levels is writing a list of sentences instead of a cohesive paragraph or misunderstanding "when you do it" as a one-time event rather than a habitual activity.
