struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 25% full marks  
competent: 65% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**

1. **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students will have difficulty comprehending "gardener," "collected waste," "pit," and "beneficial for soil health." They may not grasp that it is about composting.

2. **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires both recall (knowing about decomposition/composting) and reasoning (linking the change to soil health). Struggling students often miss the "give reasons" part or give incomplete, one-word answers. Basic-level students might recall change but struggle to articulate reasons clearly.

3. **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric expects noticing change (e.g., waste reduces, becomes dark, smells earthy) and stating it's beneficial for soil (adds humus/nutrients). Many students, even competent ones, might only state "yes, it rots" without explicitly connecting to soil health, losing marks.

4. **Common Mistakes:**  
   - Answering only "yes" or "no" without explanation.  
   - Misinterpreting the activity as burning or dumping waste.  
   - Stating it becomes manure but not explaining *why* that is good for soil.  
   - Using vague terms like "it becomes soil" without mentioning nutrient enrichment.

The competent group has a good grasp of concepts and can often overcome language hurdles to structure a complete answer. The advanced group consistently connects processes to outcomes. The basic group shows high variability, with only a quarter managing to meet all scoring criteria.
