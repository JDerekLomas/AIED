**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** For struggling students, simply reading and comprehending the sentence is a challenge. "Tiny" might be an unfamiliar word, and the concept of an "adjective phrase" (often confused with just "adjective") is abstract. Many would not attempt or would circle the whole noun phrase "A tiny bird."  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recall of the definition of an adjective (a word describing a noun) and the specific terminology "adjective phrase," which is often not internalized in students from Hindi-medium backgrounds where grammar is taught differently.  
- **Specificity of answer:** The rubric demands only "tiny," not "a tiny bird" (common mistake) or "in our balcony" (mistaking it for a prepositional phrase). This precision is difficult for basic and struggling learners.  
- **Common mistakes:** Students frequently identify the entire subject ("A tiny bird") as the adjective phrase, or they pick the location ("in our balcony") because it *seems* descriptive. The advanced group mostly avoids these pitfalls, while the competent group gets it right most times after hesitation.
