**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: **recall** (of the three questions from the passage) and then **reasoning** (to connect one of them to "real life" with a valid reason). The major barrier is language comprehension of the question itself. Many struggling students might not fully understand "important in real life" or fail to recall the specific questions. Basic-level students can often recall but may give an overly vague or unrelated reason. Competent students typically manage both steps, though some may lose marks for incomplete phrasing. Advanced students grasp the intent clearly and articulate a valid reason. A common mistake is to narrate the story instead of justifying the importance of the questions.
