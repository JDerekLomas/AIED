**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: first, recalling the three specific questions from the passage (which is a memory task), and second, applying simple reasoning to connect one of them to "real life" with a valid reason. The language of the question itself is a barrier for struggling learners, who may not comprehend "important in real life" fully. Many in the 'struggling' group might leave it blank or copy a line from the text without giving a reason. The 'basic' group often recalls the questions but writes vague or incomplete reasons. The 'competent' and 'advanced' groups can generally link the concepts (like "right time" or "right people") to everyday examples, though some competent students might lose marks for unclear expression. The rubric is generous ("any valid reason"), which helps those who understand the task.
