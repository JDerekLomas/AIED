struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
- **Language barriers:** The problem is short and numbers are clear, but some struggling students may not fully grasp “temperature increases by 2°C per hour” or confuse “4:00 in the evening” with 4:00 am.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** It requires simple reasoning (time difference calculation) and basic multiplication (6 hours × 2°C increase), but no complex concept.  
- **Specificity of answer:** The rubric requires calculating 6 hours elapsed; a common mistake is to take time difference as 4 hours (10 am to 4 pm counted incorrectly) or forgetting to add the increase to the initial temperature.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  - Misreading 4:00 evening as 4:00 am (so 18 hours difference) — rare but happens.  
  - Only calculating total increase (12°C) and forgetting to add initial 30°C.  
  - Struggling students might not attempt multiplication or confuse operations.  
  - Basic-level students often make careless time calculation errors but get the method.
