struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question has two clear parts: recall two resources and explain one's influence. The main barriers for my students are:  

1. **Language:** The question is in English. Struggling and basic-level students often misread or fail to grasp "influences the lives of the people," leading to incomplete answers.  
2. **Recall vs. reasoning:** Listing two resources is pure recall from the textbook (in Hindi medium, they may know "संगमरमर" but write "Marble"). The explanation requires simple cause-effect reasoning (e.g., "Marble gives mining jobs"), which many find hard to articulate in English.  
3. **Specificity:** Naming resources like "salt" or "sandstone" is easier; explaining influence requires connecting to livelihoods, which competent and advanced students manage better.  
4. **Common mistakes:** Students often list incorrect resources (e.g., "coal" for Rajasthan) or give vague explanations ("it is useful"). Many write only names without explanation, losing half the marks.  

Given these factors, struggling students rarely score full marks due to language and incomplete answers. Basic students often get one part right. Competent students usually manage both, and advanced students excel unless they overcomplicate the explanation.
