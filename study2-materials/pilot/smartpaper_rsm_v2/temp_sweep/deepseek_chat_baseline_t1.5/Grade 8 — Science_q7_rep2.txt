**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students would not fully comprehend "notice any change," "give reasons," or "evaluate if this is beneficial," even if the concept is familiar.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recall (knowing about decomposition/composting) and reasoning (linking change to reasons and soil health). Struggling students often miss the "reasons" or "evaluate" part even if they recall change.  
- **Specificity:** A full-credit answer needs to mention decomposition, heat, smell, volume reduction, and explicitly state benefit to soil (fertility, manure). Students often give incomplete answers like "it rots" without reasons or soil benefit.  
- **Common mistakes:** Answers like "yes, it smells" without explanation, or "it becomes compost" without linking to soil health. Many write one-word answers due to language or confidence issues.  
- **Experience:** Competent and advanced students, even with Hindi medium background, grasp the integrated demand of the question. Basic students often partially answer. Struggling students frequently misinterpret or leave blanks.
