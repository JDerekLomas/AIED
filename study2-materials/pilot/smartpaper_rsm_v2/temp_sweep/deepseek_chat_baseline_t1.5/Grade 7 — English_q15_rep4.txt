**Reasoning:** The task requires generating simple original sentences in English, not just recall. While the topic is personal and familiar, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds struggle with sentence structure, vocabulary, and writing coherently about "when" and "why." Many struggling students will produce incomplete or incomprehensible sentences, or copy the question. Basic-level students often manage a hobby name and "when," but fail to clearly state "why." Competent students usually meet all criteria, though with grammatical errors. Advanced students typically write a complete, clear paragraph.
