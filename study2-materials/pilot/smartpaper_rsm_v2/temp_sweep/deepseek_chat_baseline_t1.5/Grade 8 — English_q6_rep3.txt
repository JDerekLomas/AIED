**Reasoning:**  
The definition requires recall of specific terminology ("short story," "animals as characters," "moral lesson"). Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the vocabulary "imparts" or "moral," even if they grasp the story concept. Many in the struggling group might recall it as a "story with animals" but miss the moral lesson part. The basic group can often give a partial answer but may not phrase it precisely as per the rubric. Competent and advanced students are familiar with common textbook examples (like Panchatantra tales) and the structured definitions taught, so they perform well. However, even some advanced students may omit "short" or "typically uses animals" under exam pressure.
