**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for Hindi-medium students. Many in the struggling and basic groups may not fully comprehend "pit," "notice any change," or "beneficial for soil health" without translation or visual aids.  

The item requires not just recall (that decomposition happens) but also reasoning to link plant waste in a pit to composting, changes observed (like smell, heat, volume reduction), and finally connecting it to soil health. Struggling students often stop at "yes, change happens" without giving reasons or evaluating benefit. Basic students might give a partial reason (e.g., "it becomes manure") but may not explicitly mention soil health improvement.  

Common mistakes include:  
- Answering only "yes" or "no" without explanation.  
- Confusing this with burning of waste.  
- Unable to articulate "decomposition" or "compost" in English.  

Competent and advanced students can navigate the language and structure a complete answer, though some competent ones may still miss explicitly evaluating soil health. Advanced students typically provide well-reasoned, complete answers.
