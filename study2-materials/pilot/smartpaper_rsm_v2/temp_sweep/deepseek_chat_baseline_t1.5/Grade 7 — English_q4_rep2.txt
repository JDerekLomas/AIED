competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: first, recalling the three specific questions from the text (which many struggling/basic students may not remember accurately due to reading comprehension challenges), and second, applying reasoning to connect one of them to real life. The rubric is generous ("any valid reason"), so the main barrier is language and recall. Struggling students often cannot access the text detail. Basic students may recall the questions but struggle to articulate a reason in English. Competent students can manage both, and advanced students do so easily. A common mistake is giving a generic "yes" without a reason tied to the king's specific questions, which would score zero.
