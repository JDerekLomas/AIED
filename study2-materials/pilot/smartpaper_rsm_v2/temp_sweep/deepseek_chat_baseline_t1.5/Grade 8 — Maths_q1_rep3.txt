**Reasoning:**  
The equation `y + 9 = 4` is simple algebraically, but for my students, the main hurdles are:  

1. **Language barrier** – Many cannot read the English words “Find the value of…” easily, though numbers and symbols are familiar. Struggling students may not understand what is being asked.  
2. **Negative numbers** – The concept of subtracting a larger number from a smaller one and getting a negative result is still not solid for struggling and basic-level students. Common mistakes:  
   - Writing `y = 5` (subtracting 4 from 9 incorrectly)  
   - Writing `y = 13` (adding 9 and 4)  
   - Leaving it blank if confused.  
3. **Transposition reasoning** – Competent and advanced students can handle `y = 4 – 9` comfortably.  
4. **Recall vs reasoning** – This requires basic reasoning, but for many it’s a recall of “take 9 to the other side and change sign,” which only those who have practiced will remember.  

Given these factors, even among struggling students, a few might guess correctly or recall a similar example, but most will err. Advanced students may occasionally slip due to overconfidence, but generally will get it right.
