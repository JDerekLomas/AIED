struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This question tests **recall** of a specific, well-known fact from the textbook. However, the **language barrier** is significant—the question is in English, and terms like "urban planning," "feature," and "Harappan Civilization" may not be immediately understood by struggling and basic learners unless taught repeatedly in simple Hindi/English mix.  

- **Struggling students (10%):** Most will struggle to recall the precise term (e.g., "drainage system" or "grid layout") even if taught, due to vocabulary gaps and difficulty retaining specifics. Some may write vaguely about "bricks" or "old houses" but not meet the rubric's specificity.  
- **Basic students (40%):** About half may recall one correct feature if taught using visuals and bilingual explanations, but may express it incompletely (e.g., "they had drains" without calling it "advanced drainage system"). Language affects precision.  
- **Competent students (80%):** They grasp key concepts bilingually and can recall at least one feature correctly, though a few may mix up details (e.g., confuse citadel with "fort" only).  
- **Advanced students (95%):** Nearly all will recall and articulate a feature correctly, as they engage more with text and can navigate English terms comfortably.
