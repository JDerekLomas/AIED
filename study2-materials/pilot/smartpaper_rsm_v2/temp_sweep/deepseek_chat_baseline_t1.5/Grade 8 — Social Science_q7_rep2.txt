**Reasoning:**  
The question requires a specific recall of a cause-and-effect link (victory → control over Bengal via puppet ruler). Even though it's a core concept taught repeatedly, language is a major barrier. Many struggling students might recall "Plassey" and "British won" but cannot articulate the political consequence in English. Basic-level students often mix up Plassey with Buxar or give vague answers like "British became strong," missing the specific point about puppet nawab and control over Bengal. Competent students generally grasp and reproduce the key link. Advanced students handle it confidently. I've estimated based on the need for precise vocabulary ("political dominance," "puppet nawab," "control over Bengal") within a single sentence, which filters out many in the lower proficiency groups.
