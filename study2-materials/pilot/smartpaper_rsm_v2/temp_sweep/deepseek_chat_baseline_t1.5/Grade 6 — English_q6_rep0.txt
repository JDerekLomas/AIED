**Reasoning:**  
This item requires two distinct skills: **recall** (identifying a line from the poem) and **simple reasoning/expression** (explaining "why" in their own words). Many struggling students, due to limited reading proficiency, may not recall the exact line or may copy a random line without understanding. The "why" part is a bigger hurdle—they often cannot articulate a reason in English or may give a vague, incomplete justification.  

Basic-level students can often recall a line but their "why" explanation tends to be very brief or repetitive (e.g., "because it is nice"). They may lose partial credit for lack of specificity. Competent students are more likely to give a complete, sensible reason. Advanced students generally handle both parts well, though occasional language errors may still occur.
