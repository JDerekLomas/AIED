struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation based on my classroom experience:**  
The item directly tests recall of a standard formula and simple substitution. However, for **struggling students**, language barriers (“area”, “base”, “height”) and lack of confidence in recalling the exact formula (`1/2 × base × height`) lead to high error rates—many might multiply base × height directly and forget the half.  

**Basic-level students** often remember the formula but sometimes make calculation errors (e.g., `8 × 6 = 48`, then halving it correctly is done by most, but a few might halve only one number incorrectly). Since numbers are simple, around 60% get full marks.  

**Competent students** reliably know the formula and compute accurately; minor slips are rare.  

**Advanced students** almost never miss this.  

The rubric awards 1 mark just for stating or using the correct formula—even if arithmetic slips, but in practice, in a class assessment, I’ve observed that struggling learners often cannot write anything correct, hence the low percentage.
