struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 30% full marks  
competent: 70% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
This question requires two clear steps: **recalling/identifying a line** from the poem and **providing a reason** for liking it. Many struggling students will either fail to recall the line accurately, write it incorrectly, or give a very vague/unrelated reason (“because it is nice”). Hindi-medium students often struggle to express “why” in English. Basic-level students may manage a correct line but give a simplistic reason (“it has good words”), with some losing marks for incomplete justification. Competent students are more likely to give a relevant reason with clearer expression. Advanced students generally handle both parts well, though a few may overcomplicate or not specify the line clearly. Overall, language barriers and the need for simple written reasoning make full marks challenging for the lower groups.
