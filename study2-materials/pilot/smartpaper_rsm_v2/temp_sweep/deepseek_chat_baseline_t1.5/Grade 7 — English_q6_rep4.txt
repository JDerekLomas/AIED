**Reasoning:**  
The question requires reading comprehension and some analytical thinking to infer the poet's style, not just recall. The rubric is generous—accepting words like "simple" or "descriptive"—but students must first understand the poem and the meaning of "writing style."  

- **Struggling students** (5%): Most will not grasp the question's intent due to language barriers. They may copy a line from the poem instead of describing style.  
- **Basic students** (30%): Those who follow the lesson and recognize key terms like "descriptive" might score, but many will confuse style with theme or message.  
- **Competent students** (70%): They understand the question and can pick a suitable word from discussed options, though some may overcomplicate or choose irrelevant terms.  
- **Advanced students** (95%): Almost all will correctly identify a relevant word, with rare errors due to overthinking or using an unclear descriptor.
