**Reasoning:**  
The item requires precise recall of a definition with two key components: "short story with animal characters" and "moral lesson." Language is a major barrier for struggling and basic-level students. Many from Hindi-medium backgrounds might understand the concept orally but struggle to articulate it in written English. Common mistakes include mixing up fable with fairy tale, forgetting the moral, or not mentioning animals. Competent and advanced students, having better vocabulary and comprehension, can reproduce the definition more accurately. The 5% for struggling reflects those few who might have memorized the definition verbatim despite overall difficulties.
