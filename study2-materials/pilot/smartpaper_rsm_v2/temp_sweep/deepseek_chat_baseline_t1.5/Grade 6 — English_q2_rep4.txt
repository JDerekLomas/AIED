**Reasoning:**  
The question requires simple recall of a specific detail ("magical fairy") from a text. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the barrier is often accessing the text in the first place. Struggling students may not decode the story independently or retain the detail. Basic-level students might recall "something magical" or "a fairy" but may not write the exact phrase "magical fairy," though the rubric accepts "fairy." Competent students are likely to recall and phrase it correctly. Advanced students will have no issue. Common mistakes include not attempting the question, writing irrelevant answers, or misspelling key words.
