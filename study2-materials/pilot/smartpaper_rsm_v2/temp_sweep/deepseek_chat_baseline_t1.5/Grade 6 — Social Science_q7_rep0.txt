**Explanation:**  
- **Struggling (5%):** Most would find the English terms for resources like "gypsum" or "sandstone" difficult to recall. They might name vague or incorrect examples (e.g., "sand," "stones") and struggle to explain influence clearly due to language and conceptual gaps.  
- **Basic (30%):** Could recall one common resource (e.g., salt, sunlight) but may not correctly name a second specific one. Explanation of influence might be simplistic or incomplete, with frequent spelling/terminology errors.  
- **Competent (70%):** Likely to recall two correct resources (e.g., marble and sunlight). Explanation for one (e.g., solar energy for electricity/water heating) would be adequate, though may lack detail or have minor language issues.  
- **Advanced (95%):** Would accurately name two specific resources and give a clear, contextual explanation (e.g., marble mining providing jobs, or solar energy reducing electricity problems). Language is not a significant barrier for them.
