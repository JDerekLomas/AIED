advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question requires a precise, textbook-style definition. While fables are taught and examples are familiar, recalling the exact phrasing is challenging for students with limited English proficiency.  

- **Struggling students:** Most cannot read the question confidently or retrieve the specific English terms ("characters," "moral lesson"). They might recall a story but not the definition.  
- **Basic students:** About a third can match keywords from classroom teaching (e.g., "story with animals," "moral") but may miss completeness or clarity.  
- **Competent students:** A strong majority can reproduce the definition accurately, as they grasp both the concept and the required English vocabulary.  
- **Advanced students:** Nearly all will score full marks, though a few may overcomplicate or add unnecessary detail.
