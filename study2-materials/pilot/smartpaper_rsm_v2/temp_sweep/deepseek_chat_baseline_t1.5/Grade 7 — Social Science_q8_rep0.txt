advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**  
The item asks for recall of two main occupations and a brief description of one. While the content is from their textbook and relevant to their context (Rajasthan), the English phrasing is a barrier. Many struggling students would recall "kheti" (farming) but may not write the second occupation correctly in English, or may struggle to structure the brief description. Basic-level students, with some support, can often recall two terms but may give incomplete descriptions. Competent students handle recall well but may still have simple language errors. Advanced students navigate the language and content confidently. Common mistakes include mixing up specific occupations (e.g., listing "labor" instead of "handicrafts") or writing descriptions that are too vague to score.
