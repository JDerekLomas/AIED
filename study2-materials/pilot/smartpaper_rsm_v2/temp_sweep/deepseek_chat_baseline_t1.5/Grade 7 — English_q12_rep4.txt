**Reasoning:**  
This item requires specific grammatical knowledge (identifying subject, object, verb tense, and passive structure) rather than general comprehension.  
- **Struggling students** (35%) often cannot identify the object ("leaves") or the verb tense ("blew" → "were blown"). Many would leave it blank or write a Hindi-influenced structure.  
- **Basic students** (35%) might grasp the concept but often make mistakes in the auxiliary verb ("was" instead of "were") or omit "by the wind." Around 40% could recall the correct form if drilled.  
- **Competent students** (20%) understand the pattern and tense agreement, though some may occasionally forget the preposition "by." High success rate is expected.  
- **Advanced students** (10%) will almost all answer correctly, with rare slips in spelling or article usage.
