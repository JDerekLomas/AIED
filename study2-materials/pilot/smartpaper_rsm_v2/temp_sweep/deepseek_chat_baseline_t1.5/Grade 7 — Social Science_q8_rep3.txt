**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which is a barrier for many. The content itself (rural Rajasthan occupations) is familiar in their surroundings, so it's about recall, not complex reasoning. However, "Agriculture/farming" and "Animal Husbandry/pastoralism" require specific English terms. Struggling students often can't recall or write the correct English words despite knowing the concepts. Basic-level students might manage one occupation correctly but often miss the second or mix spellings. Competent students handle recall better in English. Advanced students are comfortable with the language and content. Common mistakes include writing vague answers ("work in fields") or local Hindi terms without translation, which may not match the rubric's expected keywords.
