**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling group:** Most cannot identify the subject, verb, and object in an English sentence. The concept of voice is abstract, and they often confuse it with tense. Common mistakes include writing "The leaves is blown by wind" or omitting "were" and "by."  
- **Basic group:** Some can identify the object ("leaves") and verb ("blew"), but struggle with the past participle ("blown") and the correct form of "be" verb ("were"). Many might write "The leaves blown away by wind" or use "was" instead of "were."  
- **Competent group:** Understand the structure and can apply the rule. Occasional errors in article usage ("by the wind") or spelling ("blowned") may occur, but most get the core transformation correct.  
- **Advanced group:** Near-perfect recall and application. Rare errors might be due to oversight, not lack of understanding.
