struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Even though the problem is numerically simple, the English phrasing ("temperature increases by... per hour," "time elapsed") can confuse Hindi-medium students. Struggling students may not fully grasp what is being asked.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires basic reasoning (finding time difference and repeated addition/multiplication), not just recall. Struggling students often fail to connect the steps.  
- **Specific answer requirement:** They must compute 6 hours × 2°C increase and add to 30°C. Common mistakes include:  
  - Misunderstanding "10 am to 4 pm" as 4 − 10 = −6 hours.  
  - Adding 2°C only once regardless of hours.  
  - Confusing AM/PM (thinking 4:00 evening is 4 am).  
- **Ability levels:**  
  - **Struggling:** Only a few who follow step-by-step guidance in class might get it right independently.  
  - **Basic:** Around 40% can manage with careful reading or peer help.  
  - **Competent:** Most understand the procedure, though some make careless time calculation errors.  
  - **Advanced:** Nearly all solve correctly; rare errors are due to oversight.
