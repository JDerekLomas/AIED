struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
The task is simple comparing of whole numbers, but language barriers (English digits/words) may confuse some struggling learners. Many in the struggling group might misread digits or order them by first digit only (e.g., putting 3367 before 736). Basic-level students generally understand place value but may rush and make careless errors. Competent and advanced students have strong number sense and should handle this easily, though a few competent ones might slip if not attentive. The rubric awards 0.5 just for identifying the smallest number first, so even partial understanding could earn full marks.
