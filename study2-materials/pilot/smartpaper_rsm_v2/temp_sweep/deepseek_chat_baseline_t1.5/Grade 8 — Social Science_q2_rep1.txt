struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question requires recall of a specific fact from the chapter. While the topic is taught in Hindi and reinforced with visuals, the English phrasing of the question and the need to articulate the feature in writing pose a significant barrier.  

- **Struggling students (35%):** Many will leave it blank, write vaguely ("they were good builders"), or confuse it with other civilizations. Only about 20% might recall and correctly write one key term like "drainage system."  
- **Basic students (35%):** They likely remember the topic but may struggle with English terms like "grid layout" or "citadel." With Hindi explanations in class, around 60% can recall and roughly phrase one correct feature.  
- **Competent (20%):** They grasp the key points and can express them in simple English. About 90% will score full marks, though some may not write with full precision.  
- **Advanced (10%):** They confidently recall and write accurately. The 5% shortfall accounts for occasional overcomplication or careless wording.
