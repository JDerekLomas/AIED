struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question requires direct recall of a specific detail ("magical fairy") from a story. For **struggling** students, significant language barriers and difficulty in retaining English textual details mean only a few who memorized that exact phrase would score. **Basic** level students might recall "fairy" but often miss the full phrase "magical fairy" or confuse it with other characters; around 40% would likely recall correctly. **Competent** students have good recall and reading comprehension, so most would get it right, though some might overthink or write "a fairy" instead of the full phrase. **Advanced** students would have no trouble with this straightforward recall item.
