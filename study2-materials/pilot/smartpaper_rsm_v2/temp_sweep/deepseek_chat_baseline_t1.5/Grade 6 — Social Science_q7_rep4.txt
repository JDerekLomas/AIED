**Explanation:**  
The question requires two correct *specific* natural resources from Rajasthan. Many struggling students cannot recall the exact names (e.g., marble, limestone) due to language barriers and weak retention. They often confuse resources or give generic answers like "soil," "rock," which may not be accepted. The basic-level students might recall one resource but often miss the second or spell it incorrectly in English. Competent students usually remember common examples like marble and limestone, while advanced students handle such recall-based items confidently. The explanation part is not scored here, so only recall matters, which benefits the competent and advanced groups.
