struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
- **Language barriers:** The question is short and numbers are given, so even students with limited English can often identify the words "base," "height," and "area." Many recognize the formula from repeated practice in Hindi or through examples.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is direct recall and application of a memorized formula. Struggling students may forget the formula or confuse it with perimeter, while basic-level students likely remember it but may make calculation errors.  
- **Specificity of answer:** The rubric only requires stating or using the correct formula, not necessarily the final numerical answer. This makes it easier for students who recall the formula but may miscalculate \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6 \).  
- **Common mistakes:** Struggling students often write "base × height" omitting the half, or confuse triangle area with rectangle area. Basic-level students might recall correctly but struggle with fraction multiplication or skip writing the formula. Competent and advanced students typically handle this confidently.
