struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation based on experience:**  
The question is direct and uses simple numbers, but for struggling students, language barriers ("area," "base," "height") and recalling the formula are major hurdles. Many in this group might leave it blank or confuse it with perimeter.  
Basic-level students often remember the formula because it is frequently drilled, but some may forget the `1/2` or multiply base and height directly.  
Competent and advanced students are very familiar with this standard formula; errors here are rare and usually due to careless calculation, which is unlikely with 8 and 6.  
The rubric is generous—it awards the mark even for stating the correct formula without computing, which helps those who recall it but may make arithmetic slips.
