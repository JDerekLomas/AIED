**Reasoning:**  
This item requires both **recall** (identifying a line) and **simple reasoning** (explaining why). Many struggling students, due to language barriers and difficulty reading the poem itself, may leave the "why" part blank or give a vague, copied reason. Basic-level students often manage to quote a line but struggle to articulate a coherent personal reason in English, sometimes just repeating the line. Competent students can usually meet both requirements, though their explanations may be brief. Advanced students typically handle it well. The specificity needed in the "why" part is the main hurdle for the lower groups.
