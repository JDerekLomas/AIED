struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This item tests the basic countable noun rule ("some" for affirmative statements, "any" for questions/negatives). However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, this is not recall but an application of a grammar rule they find abstract. The word "some" is common in textbook examples, so competent and advanced students likely recognize the pattern. Struggling students often confuse "some/any" or guess randomly due to weak reading comprehension. The basic group might recognize the sentence structure but still make frequent mistakes, so around 60% would get it correct.
