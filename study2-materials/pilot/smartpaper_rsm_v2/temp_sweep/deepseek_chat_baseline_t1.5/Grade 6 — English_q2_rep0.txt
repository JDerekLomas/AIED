**Reasoning:**  
The question requires simple recall of a specific detail ("magical fairy") from a text. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the main barriers are vocabulary (understanding "lived inside the book") and retrieval from memory in English.  

- **Struggling students:** Most would not recall the exact phrase; many might leave it blank or write a Hindi word. Some might guess "king," "queen," or "god" based on local stories.  
- **Basic students:** About half would remember "fairy" but may miss "magical" or spell it incorrectly (e.g., "faery"). The rubric accepts "fairy," so many in this group would score.  
- **Competent students:** High recall rate, though some might overcomplicate or add extra details.  
- **Advanced students:** Near-perfect recall, with rare errors due to overthinking or spelling.  

The specificity is low (accepts "fairy"), which helps basic and competent learners.
