advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, so language is a barrier for many in the struggling and basic groups, especially those from Hindi-medium backgrounds. However, the task itself involves comparing whole numbers, which is a Class 4–5 competency.  
- **Struggling students:** Many may not correctly identify 736 as the smallest because they might compare digits left-to-right without considering the number of digits (here, 736 has 3 digits, others have 4). Some may misread the numbers due to English or attention gaps.  
- **Basic students:** About half would manage because they recall place value comparison rules, though some may still confuse ascending/descending order or make place value errors.  
- **Competent students:** Nearly all will get this correct as the numbers differ clearly in digit count; only careless errors might cause rare mistakes.  
- **Advanced students:** All should score full marks easily.  

The rubric awards 0.5 marks just for putting 736 first, so partial ordering errors later wouldn’t matter, making it relatively easier.
