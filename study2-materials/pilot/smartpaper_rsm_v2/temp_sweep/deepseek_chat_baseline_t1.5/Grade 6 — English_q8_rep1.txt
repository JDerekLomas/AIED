advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This item requires understanding basic English word order (S-V-O), which is different from Hindi's S-O-V structure. Many struggling students cannot identify the subject ("he") or will place "a book" incorrectly. Basic-level students may get the core structure but often omit the article "a" or misorder "reading is" as "is reading". Competent students usually grasp the structure, though some may still make minor errors under exam pressure. Advanced students handle it confidently. The task relies more on learned syntax than pure recall, making it challenging for those with limited exposure to English sentence construction.
