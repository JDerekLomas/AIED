**Reasoning:**  
This task requires generating simple, original sentences in English, which is a significant barrier for the struggling group who may lack vocabulary and sentence formation skills. The basic group can often produce a relevant idea but may miss one element (e.g., forgetting to mention *when* or a clear *why*) or make grammatical errors that obscure meaning. The competent and advanced groups typically understand the prompt and can structure a complete paragraph, though occasional errors in tense or word choice may still cause a few in the competent group to lose marks. The rubric is clear but demands coherent expression, which is the main hurdle.
