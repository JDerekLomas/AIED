advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- This item tests the basic grammar rule of using "some" in affirmative sentences and "any" in negative/interrogative sentences.  
- **Struggling students** often confuse "some" and "any" due to lack of exposure and rote memorisation without conceptual clarity. Many will choose "any" because it sounds more familiar or is commonly heard in questions ("Are there any apples?").  
- **Basic level students** have encountered this rule but may not apply it consistently under exam conditions; about half may answer correctly.  
- **Competent students** clearly understand this distinction and will mostly select "some," though a few may overthink or make careless errors.  
- **Advanced students** will almost always get this correct, as it is a fundamental concept they have internalised.
