struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks

**Explanation:**  
The task requires constructing a simple, cohesive paragraph with three specific elements. For the **struggling** group, significant language barriers, spelling issues, and difficulty forming complete sentences mean most will miss one element (often "why it is enjoyable") or write disjointed phrases. The **basic** group can often list the required points but may struggle with paragraph flow, tense consistency, or sufficient detail on "why," leading to partial credit. The **competent** group typically handles this familiar, recall-based topic well, though minor grammatical errors may occur. The **advanced** group consistently meets all rubric points clearly. The main pitfalls are vocabulary for "why," confusion in tense ("when you do it"), and simply copying the question without a full response.
