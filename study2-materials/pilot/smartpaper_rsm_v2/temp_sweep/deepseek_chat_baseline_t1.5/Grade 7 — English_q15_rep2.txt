**Reasoning:**  
This task requires constructing a coherent paragraph in English, not just recalling a fact. For the **struggling** group, forming complete sentences is a major hurdle; they often write single words or fragments. The **basic** group can often list points (hobby, time, reason) but may struggle with sentence connectors, tense, or spelling, leading to an incomplete paragraph as per the rubric. The **competent** and **advanced** groups have the necessary vocabulary and grammar control to meet all rubric criteria, though a few in the competent group may miss one element under pressure. The topic is familiar and personal, which helps, but language production barriers significantly impact the lower-proficiency groups.
