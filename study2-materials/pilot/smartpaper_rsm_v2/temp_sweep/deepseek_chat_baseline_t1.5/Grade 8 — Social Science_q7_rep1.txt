**Reasoning:**  
The question requires a specific recall of the *consequence* of the battle (establishing political control via a puppet ruler). While the topic is taught, the language of the question and the precision of the expected answer are barriers.  

- **Struggling students** (35%) often miss key terms like "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" and may only recall "British won the battle" without explaining its impact. Language comprehension is a major hurdle.  
- **Basic students** (35%) might grasp the core idea but often express it in simpler, incomplete terms (e.g., "British got Bengal") and may not explicitly mention Mir Jafar or "puppet," losing the precision needed for full marks.  
- **Competent students** (20%) usually understand the cause-effect link and can reproduce the taught phrasing, though some may still struggle with English expression.  
- **Advanced students** (10%) consistently recall and articulate the exact required point clearly.
