**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily read or comprehend the sentence structure. "Tiny" is a simple word, but identifying it as an "adjective phrase" (though it's actually just an adjective, not a phrase) requires meta-linguistic knowledge they lack.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is recall-based if taught, but many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may not recall the term "adjective" clearly, confusing it with other parts of speech.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric expects "tiny," but common mistakes include choosing "tiny bird" (thinking phrase means more than one word) or "in our balcony" (confusing adjective with prepositional phrase).  
- **Common mistakes:** Students often pick the noun after the adjective ("bird") or the location phrase ("in our balcony") because they focus on content words they understand rather than grammatical function.
