struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily isolate individual words in an English sentence or recall the definition of an "adjective." They may confuse it with a noun ("bird") or the location phrase ("in our balcony").  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires recall of a grammar concept (adjective) and its application. Struggling students often lack this foundational recall. Basic-level students might recall the term but misapply it.  
- **Specificity:** The answer must be exactly "tiny." Common mistakes include choosing "tiny bird" (thinking it's the subject) or "in our balcony" (thinking it describes place).  
- **Common mistakes:** Hindi-medium students sometimes translate directly, identifying "bird" or "nest" as the describing word because it feels central. Also, if the teacher has recently taught "prepositional phrases," they may incorrectly select "in our balcony."  

The advanced group scores highly because they grasp concepts quickly; the competent group does well but may have a few careless errors or overthinking.
