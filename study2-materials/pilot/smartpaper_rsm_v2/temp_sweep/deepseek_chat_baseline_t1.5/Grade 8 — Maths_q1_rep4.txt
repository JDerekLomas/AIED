**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, so even with limited English, most students can identify it as a simple algebra problem. However, struggling students may be intimidated by the English letters and symbols.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires basic reasoning (inverse operation: subtract 9 from both sides) rather than rote recall, but it is a very standard type.  
- **Specificity of answer:** Only one correct answer (`y = -5`), but negative numbers are still challenging for many in Class 8, especially struggling learners.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  - Adding 9 to 4 to get `y = 13` (misunderstanding inverse operation).  
  - Writing `y = 5` (ignoring the negative sign).  
  - Leaving the answer as `y + 9 = 4 - 9` without simplifying.  
- **Group breakdown:**  
  - **Struggling:** Most will make mistakes with negative numbers or operations; only a few who grasp integers will succeed.  
  - **Basic:** About half may solve it correctly, but many will still struggle with negative results.  
  - **Competent:** Strong understanding of integers and basic algebra; high success rate.  
  - **Advanced:** All will solve it easily.
