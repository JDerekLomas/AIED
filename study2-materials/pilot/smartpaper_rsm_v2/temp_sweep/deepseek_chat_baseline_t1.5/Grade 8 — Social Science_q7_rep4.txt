**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires a specific recall of the political consequence of the battle (establishing control through a puppet ruler). Many struggling students have difficulty reading the question itself and often confuse Plassey with other battles. Basic-level students may recall the battle name but often miss the "how" part or write vague answers like "British won." Competent students generally grasp the cause-effect and can articulate the puppet nawab point, though language may still simplify their expression. Advanced students consistently identify the key rubric point clearly.
