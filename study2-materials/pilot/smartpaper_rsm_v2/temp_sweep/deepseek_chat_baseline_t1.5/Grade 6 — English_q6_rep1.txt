**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both **recall** (finding/remembering a line) and **simple reasoning** (explaining why). For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the major hurdles are:  
1. **Comprehension:** Understanding the poem well enough to choose a meaningful line.  
2. **Vocabulary:** Articulating "why" in English, even if they have a feeling in Hindi.  
3. **Specificity:** The rubric requires mentioning *why* — struggling students often leave that out or write "I like it" without reason.  

- **Struggling (35%):** Most will either copy a random line without explanation, or write a reason in broken English that may not match the rubric’s requirement for clarity. Very few will fully satisfy both parts.  
- **Basic (35%):** Can often pick a line and give a basic reason ("because it is beautiful"), but may struggle with grammar and completeness. About 1 in 5 will meet the rubric clearly.  
- **Competent (20%):** Most can recall a line and give a coherent reason, though some may not be very detailed. They understand what "why" means in this context.  
- **Advanced (10%):** Nearly all will score full marks, as they can express personal reflection with adequate language.
