**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** often cannot identify the subject ("He") or the correct verb form ("is reading"). They may jumble words into patterns from Hindi (like "He a book reading is") or simply copy words in the given order.  
- **Basic level students** can often pick out the subject and object but may struggle with the continuous tense ("is reading") and article placement, leading to errors like "He reading a book is." With the simple word set, some will get it correct through intuition.  
- **Competent students** generally understand English sentence structure (S-V-O) and can apply it here, though a few might still miss the article or tense.  
- **Advanced students** find this straightforward and will almost all arrange it correctly.  

The task requires **reasoning about word order in English**, not just recall. The specificity of the answer ("He is reading a book.") is high, and common mistakes include omitting "is," misplacing "a," or failing to use the continuous form.
