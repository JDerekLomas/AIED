**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding of decomposition and compost formation, which is part of the Class 8 Science syllabus (Chapter "Crop Production and Management" or "Microorganisms"). However, the language barrier is significant — many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to interpret "notice any change" and "beneficial for soil health" correctly.  

- **Struggling students** (35%) often miss key terms, may not attempt, or give vague answers like "it rots" without linking to soil health.  
- **Basic level students** (35%) might recall that the waste decomposes, but may not clearly articulate reasons or explicitly state the benefit to soil.  
- **Competent students** (20%) can connect decomposition to compost formation and soil enrichment, though some may lose marks on language expression.  
- **Advanced students** (10%) will accurately describe the change, reasons (microbial action, heat, smell, volume reduction), and clearly state benefits (adds humus, nutrients, improves texture).  

The 0.5 mark allocation means even a partially correct answer can score, but "full marks" requires a complete response as per rubric expectations.
