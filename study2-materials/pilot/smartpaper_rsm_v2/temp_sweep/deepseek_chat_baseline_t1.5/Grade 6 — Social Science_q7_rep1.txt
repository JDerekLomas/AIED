**Explanation based on teaching experience:**  
The question has two clear parts—mentioning two resources and explaining one’s influence. Many struggling students will miss one part or give incorrect examples due to limited recall and English comprehension. Basic-level students often recall one resource (e.g., marble) but struggle to articulate its influence clearly. Competent students typically manage both, though explanations may be brief. Advanced students handle it well, but a few may overcomplicate the explanation or mention less common examples not listed in the rubric. Common mistakes include naming crops instead of natural resources or describing "sand" (Thar) without linking it to solar/wind energy explicitly. Hindi-medium students often understand the concept but lose marks on English spelling/key terms (e.g., writing "gyp sum" or confusing limestone with lime).
