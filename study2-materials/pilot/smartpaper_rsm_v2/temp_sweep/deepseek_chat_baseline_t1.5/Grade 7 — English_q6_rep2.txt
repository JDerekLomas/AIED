**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive adjective from the text/poem studied. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the term "writing style" itself may be a barrier.  

- **Struggling students** often miss such analytical questions due to vocabulary gaps and difficulty in moving beyond literal comprehension. They might leave it blank or copy a random line from the poem.  
- **Basic level students** may grasp the question but struggle to pinpoint the exact appropriate word (e.g., "descriptive," "simple") unless explicitly taught and drilled. Some might give vague or incorrect adjectives.  
- **Competent students** are more likely to recall the discussed style from class, though some may still offer a weak or partially relevant word.  
- **Advanced students** will understand the requirement and accurately choose a rubric-aligned word like "simple" or "descriptive," as taught.
