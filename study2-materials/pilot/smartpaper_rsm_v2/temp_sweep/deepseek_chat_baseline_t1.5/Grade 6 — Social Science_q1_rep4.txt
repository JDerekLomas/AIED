**Explanation:**  
This question tests pure recall of map-based knowledge. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English names of mountain ranges (e.g., "Western Ghats" instead of "Sahyadri") can be a barrier, even if they know the geographical feature. Many struggling students might recall only "Himalaya" and not a second range, or mix up names (e.g., "Satpura" with "Vindhya"). Basic-level students often know Himalayas and one more common range like Aravalli or Vindhya, but may spell incorrectly or provide a local hill instead of a major range. Competent and advanced students are more likely to recall two correct names, though occasional spelling errors in English may still occur. The rubric is lenient (any two correct examples), so those who have engaged with the map or chapter can score.
