**Reasoning:**  
This question requires recall of a specific, memorized fact from the textbook. While the topic is taught in Hindi and discussed in class, the final assessment is in English. Students from struggling and basic groups often lose marks not due to lack of knowledge, but because of language barriers in reading the question and precisely writing the correct English term (e.g., "drainage system" vs. "good drains"). Many in the struggling group might recall vaguely ("they had good houses") but not hit the specific "key feature" as per the rubric. Competent and advanced students, having better English comprehension and retention, can accurately recall and phrase the required feature. Common mistakes include mixing up features, giving incomplete answers ("they had bricks"), or describing rather than naming the key feature.
