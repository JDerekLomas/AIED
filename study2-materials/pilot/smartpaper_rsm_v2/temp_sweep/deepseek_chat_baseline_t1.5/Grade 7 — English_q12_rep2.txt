**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students (35%):** Most have very limited grasp of English grammar structures. The concept of subject-object reversal, verb change ("blew" → "were blown"), and preposition "by" is unfamiliar. Common mistakes: omitting "were," writing "blowed," or copying the sentence as is. Only a few with rote memory might recall the pattern.  
- **Basic students (35%):** Many understand the sentence meaning but apply rules inconsistently. They often recall "was/were + V3" but may make errors in agreement ("was blown" for plural leaves) or omit "by the wind." With coaching, a significant portion can produce the correct structure.  
- **Competent students (20%):** They have been taught active-passive transformation rules and can apply them to simple past tense sentences. Occasional slips in auxiliary verb ("are" instead of "were") or spelling ("blown" written incorrectly) may happen, but most will answer correctly.  
- **Advanced students (10%):** Near-perfect accuracy; errors, if any, are careless (e.g., forgetting full stop).
