**Reasoning:**  
The question requires a specific recall of the *political consequence* of the Battle of Plassey. Even if students remember "British won," many from struggling and basic groups may not recall or articulate the idea of "political dominance through a puppet nawab" due to:  
- **Language barrier:** Terms like "establishment of British political dominance" or "puppet nawab" are challenging if they read only English.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is recall-based but needs precise linking (Plassey → control of Bengal via Mir Jafar). Struggling students often mix up Plassey with Buxar or give vague answers like "British became powerful."  
- **Common mistakes:** Writing "British defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah" without mentioning the shift in control or Mir Jafar’s role. Competent and advanced students, having better language skills and concept clarity, are more likely to include the required point.
