**Reasoning:**  
This is a pure recall question from geography. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English names of mountain ranges (e.g., "Western Ghats" instead of "Sahyadri") can be a barrier. Struggling students often mix up terms or cannot recall the specific English labels. Basic-level students may recall one major range (like Himalayas) but struggle to name a second correctly. Competent students are familiar with at least two major ranges. Advanced students typically know this well. Common mistakes include spelling errors, naming plateaus or hills instead of major ranges, or writing local names not recognized as per the textbook's English terminology.
