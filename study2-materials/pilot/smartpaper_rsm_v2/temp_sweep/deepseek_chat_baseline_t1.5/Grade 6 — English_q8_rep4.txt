**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling group:** Most cannot read or sequence English words independently. They might recognise "book" and "he" but struggle with word order (SVO) and the verb "is reading". Common mistake: writing "book a he is reading" or copying words in given order.  
- **Basic group:** Can identify basic words and have some sense of sentence structure from rote learning, but often confuse article placement ("a reading he is book") or miss the continuous tense. About 40% can apply basic SVO logic correctly.  
- **Competent group:** Understands subject-verb-object pattern and present continuous tense. May occasionally omit "a" or misplace it, but most will construct the correct sentence.  
- **Advanced group:** Will almost always get it correct as the task is straightforward for their proficiency level.  

The task requires *syntactic reasoning* rather than recall, which is challenging for Hindi-medium learners due to differing word order (SOV in Hindi) and lack of exposure to English sentence construction. The specificity of the answer ("He is reading a book") leaves little room for variation, increasing difficulty for those unsure of article use or verb forms.
