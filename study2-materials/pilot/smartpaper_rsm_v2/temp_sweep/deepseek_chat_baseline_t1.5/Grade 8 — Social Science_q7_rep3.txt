**Reasoning:**  
The question requires a specific recall of the consequence of the battle (establishing political control over Bengal through a puppet ruler). Many struggling students have difficulty recalling precise historical terms like "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" even if they grasp the general idea, and language barriers make expressing it in English challenging. Basic-level students might recall "British won control" but often omit the key mechanism (Mir Jafar/puppet rule) needed for full marks. Competent students generally remember the cause-effect link and can phrase it adequately. Advanced students reliably produce the accurate, rubric-aligned answer. Common mistakes include vague answers ("British became powerful"), confusing Plassey with other battles, or misspelling key names.
