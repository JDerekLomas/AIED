struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- The question is simple recall from geography, but the **English language** of the question is a barrier for many. Struggling students often fail to comprehend "mountain ranges located in India" properly.  
- Even if they know the names in Hindi (e.g., Himalaya, Aravali), they may struggle with English spelling or may not attempt due to lack of confidence.  
- Basic-level students might recall one range (often Himalayas) but may not write a second correctly spelled name.  
- Competent and advanced students are more likely to know at least two names and write them in English adequately, though some competent ones may still make spelling errors (e.g., "Himalaya" vs "Himalayas").  
- Common mistakes: writing "Mount Everest" (not a range), confusing Western/Eastern Ghats spelling, or leaving one blank.
