**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both recall of a specific line *and* reasoning to explain "why." Many struggling students, due to limited reading proficiency, may not recall the exact line accurately or may copy a random line without understanding. The "why" part is a significant barrier—they often give vague or unrelated reasons ("because it is nice") lacking specificity. Basic-level students can often recall a line but struggle to articulate a coherent, text-based reason. Competent students typically manage both tasks adequately, though some may lose marks for insufficient explanation. Advanced students generally handle it well, as they can read, recall, and justify with clarity.
