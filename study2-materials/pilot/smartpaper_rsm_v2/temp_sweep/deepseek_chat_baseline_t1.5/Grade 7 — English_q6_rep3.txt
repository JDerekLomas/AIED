**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable adjective. For students with Hindi-medium backgrounds and limited English proficiency, the barrier is not just vocabulary but also grasping literary terminology.  

- **Struggling students** often miss such nuanced questions because they focus on literal comprehension; many would leave it blank or give an irrelevant word.  
- **Basic level students** might manage if the style was explicitly taught and memorized (e.g., "simple"), but they often confuse style with theme or message.  
- **Competent students** can usually recall taught terms and apply them correctly, though some may overcomplicate or misjudge.  
- **Advanced students** are comfortable with literary terms and can reason from the poem even if not explicitly taught, hence high accuracy.  

Common mistakes include writing "happy," "sad," or describing the poem's topic instead of style, or using Hindi-influenced phrasing.
