struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- The formula is standard in Class 7, but **language barriers** affect reading comprehension of the question for struggling and basic learners, even if they know the concept in Hindi.  
- This requires **recall and direct application**, not complex reasoning, so competent and advanced students manage easily.  
- **Common mistakes:** Forgetting to multiply by 1/2, using wrong units, or confusing base/height with other sides. Struggling students often use `base × height` directly.  
- I gave partial credit internally in my estimate, but since the rubric awards 1 only for correct formula use, many in struggling group may recall incorrectly or leave it blank.  
- Basic group has a moderate success rate as they often remember the formula but may make calculation errors under exam pressure.
