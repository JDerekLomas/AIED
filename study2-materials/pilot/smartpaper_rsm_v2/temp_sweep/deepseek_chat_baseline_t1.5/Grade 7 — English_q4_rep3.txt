**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: recalling the three questions from the text (which are not directly stated in the question prompt) and then applying simple reasoning to give one valid reason for their importance in real life.  

- **Struggling students (35%):** Major barriers include poor reading comprehension to recall the questions from the passage and limited vocabulary to frame a reason. Many might leave it blank or copy a random line from the text.  
- **Basic students (35%):** Can often recall the questions with effort but struggle to articulate a clear, standalone reason in English. Some will give incomplete or unclear answers.  
- **Competent students (20%):** Understand the task and can recall the questions. They can formulate a simple valid reason (e.g., "because they help us succeed" or "to avoid mistakes"), though expression may still have minor errors.  
- **Advanced students (10%):** Have strong recall and can produce a well-phrased reason confidently. The only risk is overcomplicating the answer, but most will score full marks.
