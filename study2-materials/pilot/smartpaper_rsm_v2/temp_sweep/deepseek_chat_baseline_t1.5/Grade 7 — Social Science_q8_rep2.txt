struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
The question is from a familiar topic (rural Rajasthan) and asks for recall of common occupations. However, the English phrasing may be a barrier. Many struggling students might not understand "occupations" or "rural areas," even if they know the content in Hindi. They may also list only one occupation or give vague answers.  

Basic-level students, with some support or if the question is read aloud in Hindi, can often recall two common occupations like farming and animal rearing. Competent students typically handle the language and recall well. Advanced students have no issue.  

In my experience, if this was taught recently using local examples and bilingual support, these percentages reflect the likely outcomes.
