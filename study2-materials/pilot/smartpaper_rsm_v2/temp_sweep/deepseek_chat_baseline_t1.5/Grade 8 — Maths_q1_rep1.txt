**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, so language impact is minimal here. However, some struggling students may panic seeing English symbols.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires understanding inverse operations (`y = 4 – 9`) and handling negative numbers, which is more reasoning-based than pure recall.  
- **Specificity of answer:** Only `y = -5` is correct; no partial credit possible.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  - Adding 9 to both sides wrongly (getting `y = 13`).  
  - Writing `y = 5` (ignoring the negative sign).  
  - Leaving it as `y = 4 – 9` without simplifying.  
- **Group-wise rationale:**  
  - **Struggling (10%):** Many lack confidence with integers and transposition; only a few who recall the method correctly get it.  
  - **Basic (40%):** About half can perform the step correctly, but errors in integer subtraction or sign handling reduce success.  
  - **Competent (85%):** Most understand the operation, though occasional sign errors occur.  
  - **Advanced (100%):** All can solve this correctly with ease.
