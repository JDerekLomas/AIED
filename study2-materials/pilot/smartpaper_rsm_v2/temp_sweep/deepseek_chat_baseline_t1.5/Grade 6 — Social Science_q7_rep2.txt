advanced: 95% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
The question has two clear parts: **mentioning** two resources (1/2 mark each) and **explaining** one’s influence (1/2 mark). Many struggling and basic-level students, due to English language barriers, may not fully comprehend “influences the lives of people” and may only list resources without explanation, or confuse resources (e.g., saying “oil” instead of valid ones). Competent students likely recall textbook examples (like marble or sunlight) and can give a simple explanation (e.g., “marble gives jobs”). Advanced students will accurately name resources and give a clear, contextual explanation. The recall aspect is manageable, but the explanation requires connecting cause-effect in English, which is a hurdle for Hindi-medium learners.
