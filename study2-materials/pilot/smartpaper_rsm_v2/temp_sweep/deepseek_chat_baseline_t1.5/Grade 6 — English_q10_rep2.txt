**Reasoning:**  
This item tests the basic countable noun rule (some for affirmative sentences, any for questions/negatives). However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, this is often a memorized rule rather than intuitive usage.  

- **Struggling students** (35%) often guess randomly between "some" and "any" or pick "any" because it feels more familiar from questions ("Are there any apples?"). Many cannot read the sentence with understanding.  
- **Basic students** (35%) have been taught the rule but frequently mix it up in practice. About half would recall correctly in this simple affirmative context.  
- **Competent students** (20%) know this rule well and rarely mistake it in such a straightforward sentence.  
- **Advanced students** (10%) will almost always get this correct.  

The specificity of the answer helps those who have internalized the rule, but language barriers and lack of reading practice make it challenging for the lower groups.
