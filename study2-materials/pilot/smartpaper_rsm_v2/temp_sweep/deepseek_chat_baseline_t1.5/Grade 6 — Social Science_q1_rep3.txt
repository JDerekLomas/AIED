**Explanation:**  
The question is a simple recall item, but the English phrasing can be a barrier. Many struggling students might not comprehend "mountain ranges" or "located in India" clearly without translation. Even if they know the names (e.g., Himalayas), writing them correctly in English is a hurdle.  

- **Struggling (35%):** Only a few who are familiar with the Himalayas from everyday context might recall and write it. Others may leave it blank or write incorrect spellings/names.  
- **Basic (35%):** A significant portion can recall at least one major range (often Himalayas). Some may manage two with phonetic spelling (e.g., "Aravali"). Language still causes errors.  
- **Competent (20%):** Most understand the question and can recall at least two correct names, though spelling may not be perfect. They are more likely to attempt both.  
- **Advanced (10%):** Nearly all answer correctly with proper names, though occasional spelling slips occur.
