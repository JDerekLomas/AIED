**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students would not clearly distinguish "adjective" from "noun" or "verb," and might choose "tiny bird" or "in our balcony" as a phrase.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires recall of the definition of an adjective (a describing word) and the ability to pick out a single word, not a phrase. Students often confuse "adjective phrase" with any group of words describing something.  
- **Specificity:** The answer is very specific — only "tiny" — but the question says "adjective phrase," which might mislead some into looking for a group of words. Competent and advanced students would know "tiny" is an adjective, not a phrase, and might still answer correctly if they interpret the question as asking for the adjective.  
- **Common mistakes:** Common errors include selecting "tiny bird" (thinking it describes the nest or the subject) or "in our balcony" (as it tells where). Hindi-medium students often translate word-by-word and miss grammatical categories.
