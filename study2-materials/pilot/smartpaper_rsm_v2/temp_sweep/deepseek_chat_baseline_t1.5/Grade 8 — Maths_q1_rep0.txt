struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Though the equation is short and numbers are universal, some struggling students may not understand “Find the value of `y`” or the equals sign concept in English.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires understanding inverse operations (subtracting 9 from both sides) or “what number + 9 gives 4?” Many struggling students are uncomfortable with negative numbers.  
- **Specific answer:** Only `y = -5` is correct; common mistakes are `y = 13` (adding 9 and 4), `y = 5` (ignoring sign), or leaving it blank.  
- **Class reality:** Competent and advanced students handle such linear equations easily. Basic students often get it right if they recall the method, but may hesitate with negatives. Struggling students, even if they attempt, frequently make sign errors or operational mistakes.
