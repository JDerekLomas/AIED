struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
- **Struggling students (10%):** Many will not grasp the English phrasing, miss the “10 am to 4 pm” time calculation, or confuse it with a simple addition without considering hours. Some may add 2°C only once.  
- **Basic students (60%):** With some support in understanding “increases by 2°C per hour” and the time duration, most can compute 6 hours × 2°C = 12°C increase, then add to 30°C. Language and careless mistakes reduce success slightly.  
- **Competent students (90%):** They understand the problem structure well but may rarely misread “4:00 in the evening” as 4:00 am or make an arithmetic slip.  
- **Advanced students (100%):** They quickly decode the problem, calculate accurately, and check their answer.
