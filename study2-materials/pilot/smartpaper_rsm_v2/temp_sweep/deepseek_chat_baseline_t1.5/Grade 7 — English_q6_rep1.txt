**Explanation:**  
This question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive adjective. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the barrier is high.  

- **Struggling students** (35%) often cannot comprehend the question itself. They might not know words like "style" or "descriptive," leading to blank or irrelevant answers. Very few would identify a correct term.  
- **Basic students** (35%) may understand the question but struggle to recall or choose the precise adjective. They might write something related but vague (e.g., "good," "nice") and not score. About 30% might correctly pick a simple word like "simple" if taught explicitly.  
- **Competent students** (20%) can comprehend and reason from the poem’s text. They are more likely to recall taught terms like "descriptive" or "direct." However, some may still choose a close but not fully accurate word, reducing the percentage.  
- **Advanced students** (10%) grasp such literary concepts well and can accurately identify the style from given options or memory, hence the high score rate.
