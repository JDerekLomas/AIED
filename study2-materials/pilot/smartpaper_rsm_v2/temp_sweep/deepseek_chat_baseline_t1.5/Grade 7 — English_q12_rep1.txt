**Reasoning:**  
This item requires both conceptual understanding of voice change (subject-object reversal, verb form change to "were blown") and accurate execution in writing. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with English verb structures (especially past participle "blown") and preposition use ("by the wind").  

- **Struggling students** (5%): Most will leave it blank, write the original sentence, or make major errors (e.g., "The leaves is blew by wind"). Only a few with rote memory might succeed.  
- **Basic students** (30%): They may recall the pattern but often make errors in auxiliary verb ("was" instead of "were") or omit "by the wind." Some might write "The leaves were blown away" without the agent.  
- **Competent students** (75%): They understand the rule and can apply it, but occasional slips in agreement or spelling ("blowned") may occur.  
- **Advanced students** (95%): Near-perfect recall and application; rare errors might be due to oversight.  

The specificity of the answer ("were blown away by the wind") leaves little room for variation, making it challenging for learners with limited grammar practice.
