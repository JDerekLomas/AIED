struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. Struggling and basic-level students often panic or misread key terms. They might confuse "urban planning" with other topics like agriculture or trade, even if they know the content in Hindi.
2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall. Students must remember one specific, textbook-stated "key feature." Competent and advanced students who have revised can do this. Struggling students often have gaps in memorization.
3.  **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric is specific. A vague answer like "good cities" or "cleanliness" would not score. Many basic-level students might recall a related fact (e.g., "they had drains") but fail to phrase it as the "advanced drainage system," losing marks for incompleteness.
4.  **Common Mistakes:** Common errors include mixing up features of different civilizations (e.g., saying "they built pyramids"), giving examples instead of features (e.g., "Mohenjo-daro"), or writing a correct feature in Hindi when the answer must be in English, leading to incomplete sentences or spelling errors that obscure meaning. The struggling group is most affected by this.
5.  **Experience-Based Estimate:** In a typical class, the advanced learners almost always get it right unless careless. The competent group, if taught/reviewed recently, performs well. The basic group has a fair chance, as this is a core, repeated topic. The struggling group finds it hard to retrieve and articulate the precise answer in English.
