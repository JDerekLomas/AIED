**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** often cannot identify the subject ("He") or the verb ("is reading") due to limited vocabulary and grammar exposure. Common mistakes include sequences like "Book a he is reading" or omitting the article "a".  
- **Basic level students** may recognize common words but struggle with correct word order (SVO) and the auxiliary verb "is". Many from Hindi-medium backgrounds might apply Hindi syntax (Subject-Object-Verb).  
- **Competent students** generally grasp basic sentence structure, but some may still miss the article "a" or place "reading is" incorrectly.  
- **Advanced students** easily recognize the standard English structure and will arrange it correctly.  

The task requires *applied grammar knowledge* rather than pure recall, making it challenging for those with limited English immersion. The specificity of the answer ("He is reading a book") leaves little room for variation, so errors in article placement or verb form result in zero marks.
