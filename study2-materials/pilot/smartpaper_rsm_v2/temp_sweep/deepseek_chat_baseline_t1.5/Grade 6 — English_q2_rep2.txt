struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**  
The question requires direct recall of a specific detail ("magical fairy") from a text. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the main barriers are vocabulary ("magical," "fairy") and the ability to locate/remember this detail in English.  

- **Struggling:** Most would not recall the exact phrase; some might leave it blank or write "girl," "queen," or a Hindi word. Only a few with better recall might hit the keyword "fairy."  
- **Basic:** About half might remember "fairy" but may not write "magical fairy" fully. I've assumed 40% would provide an acceptable answer ("fairy" or "magical fairy").  
- **Competent:** Most understand and recall the detail, though some may miss "magical" if the rubric strictly required it. Since "fairy" is accepted, 85% is realistic.  
- **Advanced:** Near-perfect recall, but a small percentage may overcomplicate or misremember.
