**Explanation based on my experience:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive word (e.g., simple, descriptive).  
- **Struggling students** (35%) often miss such questions due to limited vocabulary and difficulty comprehending literary terms in English. Many would leave it blank or copy irrelevant lines from the poem.  
- **Basic students** (35%) might grasp the question if taught explicitly, but often confuse style with theme or message. With coaching, some can recall words like "simple" if the poem was clearly taught as such.  
- **Competent students** (20%) usually understand what is asked and can identify a relevant word if the style was discussed in class, though they may sometimes pick a less precise term.  
- **Advanced students** (10%) comfortably handle such analytical questions and accurately choose appropriate descriptors.
