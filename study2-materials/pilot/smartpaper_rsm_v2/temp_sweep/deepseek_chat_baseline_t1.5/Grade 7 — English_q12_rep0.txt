Based on my experience with this specific class profile and item, here is my estimation:

**struggling: 5% full marks**  
Students in this group have very limited understanding of sentence structure and verb forms. The concepts of subject, object, and tense are unclear. They often cannot identify the verb ("blew") or the object ("the leaves") in the active voice. The passive construction ("were blown") is unfamiliar, and they are likely to write incorrect phrases like "The leaves is blew by the wind" or simply copy the original sentence. A few might guess correctly by mimicking a pattern they half-remember.

**basic: 40% full marks**  
This group can often identify the main elements of a simple sentence. They understand the task is to "change the voice" and know a basic formula (object becomes subject + "by" + agent). Common mistakes here include incorrect past participle ("blowed" instead of "blown"), incorrect verb agreement ("The leaves was blown away"), or omitting the auxiliary verb ("The leaves blown away by the wind"). With the verb "blew" being irregular, it trips up many. Around 40% might recall the correct form and apply the structure accurately.

**competent: 85% full marks**  
These students grasp grammar rules and can apply them to familiar verbs. They know the structure for simple past passive (was/were + past participle). The irregular verb "blew/blown" is the main hurdle. Some might hesitate and write "was/were blew," but most will recall or deduce the correct past participle. Occasional mistakes include dropping "away" or writing "by the wind" as "from the wind." The majority will produce the correct sentence.

**advanced: 100% full marks**  
Students in this group have strong grammatical knowledge and vocabulary. They instantly recognize the irregular verb form and the required transformation. They are unlikely to make errors in this straightforward item. Full marks are expected from all.
