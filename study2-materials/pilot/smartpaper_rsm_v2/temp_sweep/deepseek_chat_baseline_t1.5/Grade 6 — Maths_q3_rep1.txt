struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
- **Language barriers:** The item uses only numbers and the instruction "Arrange in ascending order," which is a common mathematical term. However, students with limited English may still understand the task if it has been practiced in Hindi or through examples.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires comparing place values (number of digits first, then thousands/hundreds place comparison), which is more reasoning-based than pure recall.  
- **Specificity of answer:** The rubric awards 0.5 marks only for identifying the smallest number (736) and placing it first, which simplifies the task — students don’t need to order all four numbers perfectly.  
- **Common mistakes:** Struggling students often compare only the first digit (e.g., think 3367 is smallest because it starts with 3) or misread digits. Many in the struggling group may not grasp place value comparison across numbers with different digits (3-digit vs. 4-digit). Basic-level students often get the smallest number correct but may struggle with full ordering. Here, since only the smallest number matters, even basic students have a fair chance. Competent and advanced students rarely make mistakes on this subtask.
