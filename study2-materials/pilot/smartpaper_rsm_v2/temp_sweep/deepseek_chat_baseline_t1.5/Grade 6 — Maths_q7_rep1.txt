struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The problem is short and numbers are clear, but terms like "temperature increases by `2°C` per hour" and "time elapsed" may confuse Hindi-medium students if not explained orally. Many in the struggling group might not fully comprehend the English phrasing.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires multi-step reasoning: calculating 6 hours from 10 am to 4 pm, then multiplying 6 by 2, then adding to 30. Struggling students often miss one step, especially finding the duration correctly.  
- **Specificity:** The answer must be exact (°C value). Common mistakes include:  
  1. Misunderstanding 4:00 pm as 4 hours later (answer 38°C), ignoring it's evening.  
  2. Adding 2°C only for each full hour starting from 10 am, but miscounting hours.  
  3. Forgetting to add initial 30°C after multiplying.  
- **Advanced students** rarely err here; competent ones might occasionally misread "evening" but mostly get it. Basic-level students have partial understanding but often make step errors. Struggling students usually cannot process both time difference and multiplication.
