**Reasoning:**  
The definition requires precise recall of two key elements—animals as characters and a moral lesson. Many struggling students, due to language barriers and limited exposure, might recall only one part (e.g., "story with animals" but miss the moral) or confuse it with other story types. Basic-level students often grasp the idea but may express it incompletely in English. Competent students typically recall both parts, though wording may vary. Advanced students consistently provide the exact rubric definition.
