struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The problem is short and numbers are clear, so even students with limited English can pick out key numbers (10 am, 30°C, 2°C per hour, 4:00 evening). However, "evening" might confuse some into thinking it's 4:00 am unless explicitly linked to "4:00 pm" in teaching context.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires two-step reasoning: first, calculating the duration (6 hours), then applying the rate of increase (2°C/hour). Struggling students often miss the duration step or incorrectly count hours.  
- **Specificity:** The answer must be a single numerical value (42°C). No partial credit is given in this rubric, so a calculation slip leads to zero.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  - Misreading 4:00 evening as 4:00 am (only 6 hours difference) is less likely here, but some might think it's 16 hours later.  
  - Forgetting to multiply 2°C by 6 hours, or adding 2°C only once.  
  - Arithmetic errors in 30 + 12.  
  - Struggling students may not grasp "per hour" rate application.  

Given mixed abilities, the competent and advanced groups handle this well, while the basic group has about half succeeding with careful reading. The struggling group has a few who can follow step-by-step guidance but often falter independently.
