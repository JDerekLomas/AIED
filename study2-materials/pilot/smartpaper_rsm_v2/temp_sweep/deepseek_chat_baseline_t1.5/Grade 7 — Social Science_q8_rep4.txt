struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
The question is from a familiar topic (rural Rajasthan) and requires recall of common occupations, which are taught with local examples and visuals. However, the **language barrier is significant**—many struggling and basic-level students cannot independently decode the English question, especially words like "occupations" or "Rajasthan." They might not understand what is being asked even if they know the content.  

The **recall is specific**—students must remember and write at least two correct terms (e.g., farming, animal husbandry). Struggling learners often recall only one or give vague answers ("work in fields"). Basic-level students may know the answers in Hindi but struggle to write them in English or spell them correctly (e.g., "agriculcher"). Competent and advanced students overcome the language hurdle and recall accurately.  

In my experience, with translation support and prior teaching in mixed language, about 10% of struggling students (those who grasp key terms) and 40% of basic-level students (who can navigate the question with effort) would score full marks. Competent and advanced students perform well because the task aligns with direct recall from textbook content.
