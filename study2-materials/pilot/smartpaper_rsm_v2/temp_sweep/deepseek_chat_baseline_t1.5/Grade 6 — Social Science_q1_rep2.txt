struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is a direct recall item from the geography chapter on Indian landforms, which is taught in Class 6. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the English names of mountain ranges ("Aravalli," "Vindhya," "Satpura") can be a barrier, even if they know the concepts in Hindi. The Himalayas and Western/Eastern Ghats are more frequently recalled.  

- **Struggling students (35%):** Most will struggle to recall and write the English names correctly; many may leave it blank or write incomplete/incorrect spellings. Only a few who remember the most prominent (Himalayas) might get it.  
- **Basic students (35%):** About 40% may manage one correct name (often Himalayas or Western Ghats), as they have basic recall but may not confidently write two with correct spelling.  
- **Competent students (20%):** Most will recall at least two correctly, though some may make spelling errors (e.g., "Aravali" instead of "Aravalli") which the rubric likely accepts.  
- **Advanced students (10%):** They consistently recall and spell correctly, often writing more than two if allowed.  

Note: If the question were asked in Hindi, scores for struggling and basic groups would be significantly higher.
