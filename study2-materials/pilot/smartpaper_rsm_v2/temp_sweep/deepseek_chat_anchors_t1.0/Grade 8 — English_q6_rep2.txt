REASONING: This question requires a specific, concise definition with two key elements (animals as characters, moral lesson), similar to the "archaeological vs. literary sources" item (15% pass) which required a differentiated definition, but is likely simpler as it targets a single term. It is more straightforward than the poem theme item (5% pass) but less free-form than the "favorite season" paragraph (30% pass).

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
