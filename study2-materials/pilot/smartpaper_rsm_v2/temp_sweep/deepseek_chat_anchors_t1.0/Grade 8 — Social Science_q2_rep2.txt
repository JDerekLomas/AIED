REASONING: This question is more concrete and fact-based than the poem theme (5%) but requires specific recall of a historical detail, making it somewhat harder than naming Fundamental Rights (66%) or stating the king's three questions (50%). It is likely similar in difficulty to differentiating source types (15%), as both require recalling a specific curriculum concept.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
