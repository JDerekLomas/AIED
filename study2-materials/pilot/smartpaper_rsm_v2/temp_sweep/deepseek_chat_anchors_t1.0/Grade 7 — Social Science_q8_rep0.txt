REASONING: This question requires specific, factual knowledge about Rajasthan's rural economy, similar to the anchor item on Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate), but with a more localized focus that may be less consistently taught or recalled than nationally-mandated constitutional rights. It is likely easier than the poem theme (5%) and the sources of history (15%) items, as it asks for straightforward recall rather than interpretation or differentiation.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
