REASONING: This question requires specific factual recall (naming two resources) and a basic explanation, which is more concrete than interpreting a poem's theme (5% pass) but slightly more demanding than naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass), as it adds an explanation component.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
