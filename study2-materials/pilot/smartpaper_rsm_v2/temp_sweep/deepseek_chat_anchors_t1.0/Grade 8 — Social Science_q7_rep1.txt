REASONING: This question requires specific historical knowledge and a cause-effect explanation, making it more difficult than recalling Fundamental Rights (66%) or naming the three questions (50%), but likely less difficult than the abstract theme of a poem (5%) or differentiating source types (15%). It is similar in difficulty to the "favorite season" paragraph (30%), but more constrained.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
