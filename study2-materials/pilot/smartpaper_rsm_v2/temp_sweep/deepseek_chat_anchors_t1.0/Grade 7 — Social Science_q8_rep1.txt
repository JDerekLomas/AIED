REASONING: This question requires specific regional knowledge (Rajasthan) and listing two occupations, which is more demanding than naming two general Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate) but less abstract than identifying a poem's theme (5% pass rate). It is similar in difficulty to the archaeological vs. literary sources item (15% pass rate), as both test recall of factual social science content.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
