REASONING: This question requires basic understanding of composting, a common Class 8 Science topic (Garbage In, Garbage Out), and is more concrete and applied than the low-pass-rate anchor items on abstract themes or historical differentiation. It is similar in difficulty to naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate), but likely slightly easier as it draws directly from environmental daily life.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
