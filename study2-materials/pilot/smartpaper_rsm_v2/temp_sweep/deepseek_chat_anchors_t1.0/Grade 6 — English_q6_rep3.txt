REASONING: This item requires both recall of a specific line and a simple personal justification, which is more demanding than naming two rights (66%) but less complex than constructing a thematic interpretation (5%) or differentiating source types (15%). It is similar in cognitive demand to the "favorite season" paragraph (30%), but with the added step of recalling a poetic line.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
