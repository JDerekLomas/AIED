REASONING: This question requires specific historical cause-and-effect knowledge about a key event, similar to the "three questions" item (50% pass rate) but more conceptually demanding than naming Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate). It is likely harder than the "three questions" item because it asks for a contribution or consequence, not just a recall of listed points.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
