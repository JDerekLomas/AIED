REASONING: This item requires both recall of a specific line and a simple personal justification, which is more demanding than naming two rights (66%) but less demanding than constructing a full paragraph (30%) or differentiating concepts with examples (15%). It is similar in cognitive demand to the "three questions" item (50%), but the need for a personal "why" may add slight difficulty.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
