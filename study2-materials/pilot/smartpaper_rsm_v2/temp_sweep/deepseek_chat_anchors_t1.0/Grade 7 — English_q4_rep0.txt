REASONING: This item requires both comprehension of the text (knowing the three questions) and a simple, valid personal justification, making it more complex than the 66% anchor (which only required recall of two Fundamental Rights) but simpler than the 5% anchor (which required abstract thematic interpretation of a poem). It is most similar in cognitive demand to the 50% anchor, which also required recalling the king's questions from the passage.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
