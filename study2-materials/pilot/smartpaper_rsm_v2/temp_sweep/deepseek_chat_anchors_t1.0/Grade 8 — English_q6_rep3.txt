REASONING: This question requires a specific, textbook definition with two key components (animals as characters and a moral lesson), similar to the "archaeological vs literary sources" item (15% pass) which also required a precise definition, but it is more straightforward than the poem theme item (5% pass) which demanded higher-order interpretation.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
