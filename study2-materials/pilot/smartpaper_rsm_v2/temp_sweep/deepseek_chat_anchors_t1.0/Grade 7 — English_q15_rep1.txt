REASONING: This item is most similar to the "My favorite season" paragraph task (30% pass rate), but it is simpler as it requires less detail (4-5 sentences vs. 6-8 lines) and draws from a more familiar, personal topic (hobby vs. season-specific activities/foods/clothing). It is significantly easier than the poem theme (5%) or history differentiation (15%) items.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
