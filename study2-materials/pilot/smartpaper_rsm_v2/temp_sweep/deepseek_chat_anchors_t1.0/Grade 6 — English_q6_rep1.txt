REASONING: This item requires both recall of a specific line and a simple personal justification, which is more demanding than naming rights or a season but less structured than differentiating source types or identifying a theme. It is likely harder than the 50% and 66% items but easier than the 5% and 15% items, placing it closest to the 30% "favorite season" item in cognitive demand.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
