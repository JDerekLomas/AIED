REASONING: This question requires both recall of specific factual knowledge (two natural resources of Rajasthan) and a basic explanation of influence, which is more demanding than simply naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate) but less abstract than identifying a poem's theme (5% pass rate). It is similar in structure to the "archaeological vs literary sources" item (15% pass rate), but about a more concrete, geography-based topic.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
