REASONING: This question requires specific factual recall (naming two resources) and basic application (explaining influence), which is more demanding than naming Fundamental Rights (66% anchor) but similar in structure to the archaeological vs. literary sources question (15% anchor), though perhaps slightly easier as it deals with a concrete, local topic.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
