REASONING: This question requires specific historical cause-and-effect knowledge about a key event, similar to the "three questions" item (50% pass rate) but more conceptually demanding than naming Fundamental Rights (66%). It is likely harder than the literary vs. archaeological sources item (15%) as it needs a precise explanation, not just differentiation with examples.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
