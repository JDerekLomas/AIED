REASONING: This question is a basic grammar fill-in-the-blank requiring the choice between "some" (used in affirmative statements) and "any" (often used in questions/negatives). It is far simpler than any anchor item, as it tests a fundamental rule rather than comprehension, recall, or paragraph writing.
