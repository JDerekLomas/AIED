REASONING: This item requires identifying a single-word adjective in a simple sentence, which is a more basic and discrete grammar task than the thematic interpretation, paragraph writing, or definition-based questions in the lower-pass-rate anchors. It is most comparable to the 66% anchor (naming two Fundamental Rights), but is likely even simpler as it involves only one specific word.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
