REASONING: This task requires recalling a specific line from a poem (a textual detail) and providing a simple personal justification, which is less abstract than identifying a theme and simpler than constructing a full paragraph. It is likely easier than the 5% and 15% anchor items but may be slightly more demanding than the 50% and 66% recall-based items due to the "why" component.  
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
