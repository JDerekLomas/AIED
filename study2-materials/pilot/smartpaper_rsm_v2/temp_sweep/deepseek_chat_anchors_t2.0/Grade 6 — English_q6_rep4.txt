REASONING: This question requires both recall of a specific line and a personal explanation, making it more demanding than simple recall or listing (like the 66% or 50% items) but potentially more accessible than the highly abstract theme question (5%). Its cognitive demand is similar to the "favorite season" paragraph (30%), but with the added constraint of sourcing from a poem.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
