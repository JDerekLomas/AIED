REASONING: This item is most similar in structure and demand to the "My favorite season" anchor (30% pass rate), but asking about a hobby is more concrete, personal, and routinely practiced than explaining a poem's theme (5%) or differentiating source types (15%), making it easier than those. It is slightly more demanding than simply naming fundamental rights (66%) as it requires constructing a short paragraph.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
