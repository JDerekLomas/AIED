REASONING: This question is about a specific, well-known fact from the Class 8 History syllabus (The Harappan Civilization), making it more comparable to the anchor item on Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate) in terms of being a standard curriculum recall item, but likely slightly easier than the literary/archaeological sources item (15% pass rate) which required a comparison.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
