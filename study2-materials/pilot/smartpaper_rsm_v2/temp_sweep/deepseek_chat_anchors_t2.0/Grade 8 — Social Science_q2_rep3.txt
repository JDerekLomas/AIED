REASONING: This question requires specific, recall-based knowledge about Harappan Civilization, similar to the archaeological sources item (15% pass rate), but is arguably more concrete and narrowly scoped, likely placing it between the "three questions" item (50%) and the "Fundamental Rights" item (66%) in difficulty.  
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 58%
