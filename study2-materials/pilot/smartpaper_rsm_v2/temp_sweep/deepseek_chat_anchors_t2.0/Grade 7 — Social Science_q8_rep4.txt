REASONING: This question requires specific state-based content knowledge (Rajasthan's rural occupations) and a brief description, making it harder than general Fundamental Rights or season questions but comparable in cognitive demand to differentiating source types, where partial credit exists. However, lacking a description yields a score of 0, unlike the partial definitions possible in the archaeology question.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
