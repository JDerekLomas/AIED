REASONING: This question requires interpreting literary style, which is more abstract than recalling facts (like Fundamental Rights at 66% or the king's questions at 50%) and less scaffolded than a personal paragraph ("My favorite season" at 30%). It is closer in cognitive demand to identifying a poem's theme (5% pass rate), but asking for a single descriptive word might be slightly more accessible than synthesizing a full theme. However, given the difficulty Indian Class 7 students have with literary analysis, it is likely harder than the recall-based items but potentially similar to or slightly easier than the theme question.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 10%
