REASONING: This question is akin to an applied life science/composting question. It is more concrete and everyday than the poem theme (5%) or historical source differentiation (15%), and more aligned with common rural/agricultural knowledge, making it easier than those but perhaps similar in difficulty to the "favorite season" descriptive prompt (30%) or the specific factual recall about the king's questions (50%).

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
