REASONING: This question requires specific historical cause-effect knowledge (Battle of Plassey → control of Bengal via a puppet ruler), making it more similar in difficulty to the literary/archaeological sources item (15% pass rate) than to the simpler recall questions like naming Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate).  
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 18%
