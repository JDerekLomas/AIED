REASONING: This question is more abstract and requires analyzing style rather than recalling content, similar to the poem theme item (5% pass rate), but here the rubric is broader, accepting multiple suitable descriptive words. This likely makes it slightly easier than the theme question but harder than the concrete, list-based questions like the Fundamental Rights one (66%).

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
