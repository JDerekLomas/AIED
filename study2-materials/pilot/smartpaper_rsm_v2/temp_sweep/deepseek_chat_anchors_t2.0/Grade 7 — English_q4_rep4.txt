REASONING: This question is more accessible than the anchor items with 5% and 15% pass rates, as it asks for a simple personal opinion/reason based on a clearly stated passage. It is comparable in difficulty to the 50% and 66% anchor items, as it requires basic comprehension and a one-sentence justification rather than recall, analysis, or sustained writing.
