REASONING: This item requires recall of specific regional knowledge and a brief description, which is more challenging than naming Fundamental Rights (66% anchor) but simpler than differentiating between historical source types (15% anchor) or identifying a poetic theme (5% anchor). It is somewhat akin to naming the three questions (50% anchor) in terms of factual recall, but with added descriptive demand.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
