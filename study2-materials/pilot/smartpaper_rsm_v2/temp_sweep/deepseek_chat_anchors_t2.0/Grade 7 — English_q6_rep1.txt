REASONING: This item requires students to recall and apply a literary term ("writing style") to describe a poet's approach, which is more abstract than recalling facts like Fundamental Rights or a season name, but less complex than identifying a theme or differentiating source types. It is likely easier than the 5% and 15% items but harder than the 30%, 50%, and 66% items.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
