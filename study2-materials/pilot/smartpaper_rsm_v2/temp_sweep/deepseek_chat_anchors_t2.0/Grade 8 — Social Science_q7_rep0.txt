REASONING: This question requires specific recall of a historical cause-and-effect link (Battle of Plassey → British dominance in Bengal via a puppet ruler), similar in conceptual demand to defining archaeological vs. literary sources but with a narrower factual focus. It is harder than naming Fundamental Rights but likely easier than extracting a central theme from a poem.
