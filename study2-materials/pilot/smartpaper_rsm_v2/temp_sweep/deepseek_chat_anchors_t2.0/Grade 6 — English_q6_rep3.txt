REASONING: This item requires both recall of a specific line and a simple personal justification, which is more demanding than rote recall (like naming fundamental rights at 66%) but less abstract than identifying a central theme (which had a 5% pass rate). It is comparable to the paragraph writing task (30% pass rate), as both require constructing a short, coherent response.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
