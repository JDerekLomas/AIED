REASONING: This item requires a specific historical cause-effect explanation from Class 8 History (From Trade to Territory), making it more demanding than recalling two Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate) or identifying three questions from a story (50% pass rate), but more structured and concrete than identifying a poetic theme (5% pass rate). It is similar in cognitive demand to differentiating archaeological and literary sources (15% pass rate), as both require recalling and applying curriculum-based factual knowledge.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 18%
