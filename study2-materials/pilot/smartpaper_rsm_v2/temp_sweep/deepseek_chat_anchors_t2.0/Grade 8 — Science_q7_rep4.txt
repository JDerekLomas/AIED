REASONING: This question asks about observable decomposition in composting and its benefit to soil, which is a concrete, practical concept from Class 8 Science (Chapter: Microorganisms; Management of Natural Resources). It is more straightforward than the abstract poetry theme (5%) and the precise historical differentiation (15%), but slightly more demanding than simply naming two fundamental rights (66%) or listing three questions from a story (50%), as it requires a basic cause-and-effect explanation.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
