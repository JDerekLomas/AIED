REASONING: This question requires factual recall (naming resources) and basic application (explaining influence), similar to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) which required two correct names, but here the explanation adds a slight step that may lower success. It is much easier than the "Theme of the poem" (5%) or differentiating source types (15%).  
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
