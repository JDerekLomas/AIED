REASONING: This question requires specific, concrete knowledge about a particular region's rural economy, which is more straightforward than identifying abstract themes or differentiating source types, but slightly more demanding than naming universal constitutional rights. Compared to the "Fundamental Rights" item (66% correct), it is likely harder because it is topic-specific, not universally taught/recalled.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
