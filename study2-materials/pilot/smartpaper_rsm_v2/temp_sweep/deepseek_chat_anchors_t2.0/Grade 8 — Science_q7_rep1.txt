REASONING: This question requires understanding of composting/decay, a practical concept in Class 8 Science (Microorganisms, Crop Production). It is more concrete than literary themes or abstract historical differentiation, and less demanding than constructing a full paragraph. It is comparable to recalling two Fundamental Rights but requires applying simple reasoning, likely placing it between the 50% and 66% anchor items in difficulty.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 58%
