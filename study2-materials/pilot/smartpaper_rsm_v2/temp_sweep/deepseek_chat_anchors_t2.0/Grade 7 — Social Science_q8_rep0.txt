REASONING: This question requires recall of specific regional knowledge (Rajasthan's rural occupations), which is more concrete than abstract themes in poetry but still demands content knowledge beyond general awareness, making it moderately difficult—likely between the archaeological/literary sources item (15%) and the Fundamental Rights item (66%).

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
