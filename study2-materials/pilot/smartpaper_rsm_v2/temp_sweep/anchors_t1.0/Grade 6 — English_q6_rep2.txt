REASONING: This question is harder than the 50% anchor because it requires both recalling a specific line and providing a personal interpretation. However, it's easier than the 5% anchor as it doesn't require identifying an abstract theme, but rather a personal preference, which is less demanding. It's similar to the 30% anchor in requiring personal expression but within the context of the poem, making it slightly more challenging than a simple paragraph.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
