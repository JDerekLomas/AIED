REASONING: This question requires students to recall the king's questions (like the 50% pass rate anchor) but then connect them to real life and provide a reason, which is a higher-order thinking skill than just recall. However, it's still a single mark question with a flexible 'any valid reason' rubric, making it less demanding than the 'theme' or 'differentiate and give examples' questions. The language is simple, like the Fundamental Rights question, but requires more independent thought than just naming facts.
