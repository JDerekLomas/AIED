REASONING: This item is significantly easier than all the anchor items. It tests basic sentence structure, which is fundamental to English and typically taught very early. Unlike the theme identification, historical differentiation, descriptive writing, or even recalling specific facts, rearranging words into a simple SVO sentence requires minimal cognitive load and no prior conceptual knowledge beyond basic English word order. The King's questions and Fundamental Rights questions required recall of specific information, and the "favorite season" required sentence construction, but this question provides all the necessary words. Even the 50% pass rate item (recalling the king's questions) required remembering information, while this is just applying a simple grammatical rule.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
