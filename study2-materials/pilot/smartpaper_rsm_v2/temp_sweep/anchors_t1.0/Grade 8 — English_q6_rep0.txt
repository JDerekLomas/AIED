REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "Fundamental Rights" question (66% pass rate) as it requires recall of a definition, but it's slightly harder because "fable" might be a less frequently reinforced concept than fundamental rights. It's much easier than "The Last Bargain" or "Archaeological/Literary sources" which require more synthesis or extended explanation.
