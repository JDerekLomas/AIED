REASONING: This question requires students to connect the story's themes to their personal understanding of real life, which is more complex than simply recalling facts (like the 50% and 66% anchors) but less demanding than analyzing poetic themes (5% anchor) or defining historical sources (15% anchor). The "giving one reason" part adds a slight challenge, but it's open-ended and allows for simple, relatable answers.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
