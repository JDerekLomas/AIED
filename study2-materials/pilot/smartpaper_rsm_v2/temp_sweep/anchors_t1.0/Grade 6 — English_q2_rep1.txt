REASONING: This question is a direct recall from a story, similar to the "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) but likely even simpler as it asks for a single, easily identifiable character. Unlike "The Last Bargain" theme (5% pass rate), it doesn't require inferential thinking or complex understanding.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
