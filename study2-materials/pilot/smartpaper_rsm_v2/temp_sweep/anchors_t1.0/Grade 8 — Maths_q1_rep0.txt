REASONING: This item involves a basic algebraic equation with a single variable, requiring one subtraction step. While it introduces negative numbers, it is a fundamental skill for Class 8 Mathematics and is simpler than the English and Social Science anchor items that require understanding of concepts and extended writing. It is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" question in terms of direct recall/application of a learned skill but involves a calculation rather than memorization. Many students might make calculation errors with negative numbers, but the core concept is straightforward.
