REASONING: This question requires historical knowledge and understanding of cause-and-effect, which is generally harder than recalling facts but easier than complex literary interpretation. The specificity of the event (Battle of Plassey) and the need to link it to British power expansion makes it more demanding than simply listing rights or identifying details from a provided passage.
