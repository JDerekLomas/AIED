REASONING: This question requires students to recall knowledge about decomposition and its benefits, which is a core concept in Class 8 Science. However, it also demands more than a simple recall; students need to apply this knowledge to a real-world scenario, infer the "changes" the gardener would notice, provide reasons for these changes, and then evaluate the benefit. The need to generate the "changes" and "reasons" rather than simply identify them from a list makes it more demanding than direct recall questions like Fundamental Rights or the king's questions. The "evaluate" part also adds another layer of complexity. Students might struggle with articulating the scientific reasons and connecting it explicitly to soil health, similar to how they struggled with explaining the "theme" of a poem or differentiating historical sources with full clarity. The open-ended nature and multi-part requirement will likely depress the pass rate.
