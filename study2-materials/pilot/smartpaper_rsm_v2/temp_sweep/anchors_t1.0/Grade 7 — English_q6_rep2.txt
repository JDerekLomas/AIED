REASONING: This question is harder than the "Fundamental Rights" and "King's questions" anchors as it requires inferential understanding beyond direct recall from the text. It's comparable to "My favorite season" in that it requires some original thought and expression, but potentially harder because "writing style" can be an abstract concept for Class 7 students. It's easier than "The Last Bargain" theme question, which requires a deeper thematic analysis.
