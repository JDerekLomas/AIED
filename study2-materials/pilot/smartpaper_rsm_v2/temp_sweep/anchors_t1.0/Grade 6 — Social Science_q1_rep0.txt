REASONING: This question requires recall of specific geographical facts, similar to naming Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate), but potentially slightly harder as mountain ranges might be less frequently discussed or emphasized than constitutional rights. However, it's a direct recall, not requiring interpretation or differentiation like the archaeological sources (15%) or poem theme (5%).
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
