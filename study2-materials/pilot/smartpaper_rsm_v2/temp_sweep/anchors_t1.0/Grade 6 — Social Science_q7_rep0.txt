REASONING: This question is comparable to the 66% pass rate anchor item (Fundamental Rights) because it asks for recall of two specific facts and a basic explanation, which is slightly more complex than just naming. However, the topic of natural resources is commonly discussed and easily observable in everyday life, making it potentially more accessible than abstract constitutional rights for a Class 6 student in a specific region like Rajasthan. Therefore, it might be slightly easier than the Fundamental Rights question.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
