REASONING: This question is harder than the 66% anchor item (Fundamental Rights) because it requires a specific grammatical identification rather than recalling factual knowledge. However, it's significantly easier than the "The Last Bargain" theme question (5%) or the "Archaeological vs. Literary" differentiation (15%) as it's a direct identification from a given sentence, not requiring abstract thought or extensive recall. It's more akin to the "My Favorite Season" prompt (30%) in that it requires applying knowledge, but the answer is contained within the question itself, making it slightly easier. The rubric focuses only on "tiny" as an adjective, not an adjective *phrase*, which simplifies the task.
