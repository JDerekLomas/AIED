REASONING: This item is significantly harder than the 66% and 50% pass rate anchors. It requires a specific grammatical identification (adjective phrase) which is often challenging for students, as evidenced by the low scores on abstract concepts like "theme" (5% pass rate). The rubric itself is flawed, as "tiny" is an adjective, not an adjective phrase. Even if the student identifies "tiny", they may struggle with the "phrase" aspect, and if they try to identify a phrase, they might pick "a tiny bird" or "in our balcony" (prepositional phrase functioning adverbially), both incorrect for "adjective phrase".
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 10%
