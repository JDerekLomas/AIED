REASONING: This question is about a specific grammar rule that requires understanding of tenses and subject-object transformation. While it's a direct application of a learned concept, the complexity of changing verb forms (blew to were blown) might make it harder than simple recall questions (like Fundamental Rights) but easier than analytical tasks (like poem themes). I anticipate it will be similar in difficulty to the "King's three questions" or "Archaeological vs. Literary sources" since it's a specific knowledge application.
