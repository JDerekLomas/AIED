REASONING: This question is comparable to the 50% pass rate anchor item (King's questions) as it requires extracting specific information from a short text/problem and performing a simple calculation. It's likely harder than the 66% anchor (Fundamental Rights) as it involves calculation beyond direct recall. However, it's easier than the 30% and below anchors which require more abstract thought, paragraph writing, or differentiating concepts. The primary challenge will be accurately calculating the time difference and then applying the increase, which is a common type of word problem for Class 6.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
