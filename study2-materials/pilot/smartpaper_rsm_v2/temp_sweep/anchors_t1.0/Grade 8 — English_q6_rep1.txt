REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) in that it requires recalling a definition, but it's slightly harder than "The King's Questions" (50% pass rate) as that question's answer was directly extracted from a passage. The term "fable" is common, but recalling its precise definition and key characteristics might be challenging for some students.
