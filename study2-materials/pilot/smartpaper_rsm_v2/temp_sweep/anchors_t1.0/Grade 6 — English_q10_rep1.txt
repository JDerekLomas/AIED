REASONING: This item is significantly easier than the anchor items. It tests a basic grammatical concept (some vs. any) that would likely have been drilled repeatedly in Class 6. The anchor items, even the 66% one, require recall of specific factual information or some level of synthesis/paragraph writing, whereas this is a straightforward fill-in-the-blank with only two options. I would expect a much higher pass rate as many students, even those struggling with more complex tasks, would get this correct.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 85%
