REASONING: This question is harder than the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66%) because it requires knowledge of a specific grammatical term and its application, which is generally more challenging for students than recalling factual information. It is easier than "The Last Bargain" (5%) and "Archaeological vs. Literary Sources" (15%) because it deals with a single, common grammatical concept, not abstract literary interpretation or historical methodology, and the sentence provided is simple. It's likely similar in difficulty to the "King's three questions" (50%) but slightly harder, as it requires identification and labeling of a part of speech rather than direct recall from a passage. The common misunderstanding of "adjective phrase" versus a single adjective will likely cause issues.
