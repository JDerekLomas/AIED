REASONING: This question is harder than the 66% and 50% pass rate anchor items, as it requires a specific grammatical concept rather than recalling information from a text or general knowledge. It's comparable to the 30% anchor in terms of requiring application of a learned concept, but perhaps slightly easier as "tiny" is a straightforward adjective and doesn't require composing a paragraph. However, it's significantly easier than the 5% and 15% anchors which require deeper analysis or complex differentiation.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
