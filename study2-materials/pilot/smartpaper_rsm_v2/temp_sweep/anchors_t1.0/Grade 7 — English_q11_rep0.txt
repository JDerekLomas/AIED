REASONING: This question is harder than the 66% and 50% anchor items because it requires applying a specific grammatical concept rather than recalling factual information or direct answers from a passage. It is comparable to the 30% anchor item in requiring a specific grammatical identification, but slightly easier as it asks for a single word rather than a phrase and the target word is quite prominent. It is significantly easier than the 15% and 5% items which require complex understanding, differentiation, and thematic interpretation. The specific challenge is identifying an "adjective phrase" when the answer is a single adjective. Many students might struggle with the "phrase" part of the question or simply not know what an adjective is.
