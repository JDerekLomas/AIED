REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "Fundamental Rights" question, requiring recall of specific factual information from a well-covered topic in Class 7 Social Science (Geography/Civics). It's easier than the "Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" because it doesn't require differentiation or examples of abstract concepts, and much easier than the "Last Bargain" question which requires analytical thinking.
