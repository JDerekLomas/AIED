REASONING: This question is a straightforward application of arithmetic, requiring students to calculate elapsed time and then perform a simple multiplication and addition. It is less abstract than the literature or social science questions and involves fewer steps or complex understanding than many of the lower pass-rate anchors. I expect it to be one of the easier questions for students who can perform basic calculations.
