REASONING: This item is similar in structure and required output to the "My Favorite Season" anchor (30% pass rate), but asks for fewer lines and a slightly simpler, more universally relatable topic (hobbies vs. seasons which might have regional variations in preference). It also only has a maximum score of 1, indicating less stringent scoring than the "favorite season" item which had a max score of 3. These factors should make it easier than the "Favorite Season" item, but still more challenging than direct recall questions like the Fundamental Rights or the King's questions, which had higher pass rates.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
