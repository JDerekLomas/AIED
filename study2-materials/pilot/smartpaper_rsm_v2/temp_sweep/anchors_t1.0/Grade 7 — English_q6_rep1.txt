REASONING: This question is harder than the 50% pass rate item because it requires interpretation and vocabulary beyond simple recall from a passage. It is comparable to the 15% item because it requires a conceptual understanding and the ability to articulate it, though it only asks for one word instead of two definitions and examples. Given the general difficulty with abstract concepts and specific vocabulary shown in the anchor items, I'd expect a lower pass rate, similar to the "Archaeological vs. Literary Sources" question, but slightly higher since it's only one word.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
