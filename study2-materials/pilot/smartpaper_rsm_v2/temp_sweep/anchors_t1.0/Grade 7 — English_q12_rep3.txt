REASONING: This item is similar in difficulty to the "Fundamental Rights" question (66% pass rate) as it requires recall of a grammatical rule and its application to a simple sentence. However, it might be slightly harder as it involves a transformation, which can be tricky for students who struggle with tenses or auxiliary verbs. It's significantly easier than the "Theme of the poem" or "Archaeological vs. Literary sources" questions which require deeper understanding or analytical skills.
