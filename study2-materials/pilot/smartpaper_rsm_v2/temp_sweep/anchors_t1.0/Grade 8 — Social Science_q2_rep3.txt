REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the Fundamental Rights question (66% pass rate) and the King's three questions (50% pass rate) because it requires recalling a specific factual detail from the textbook, but only one detail is needed. It's easier than the "Last Bargain" or historical sources questions which require more interpretive or comparative thinking.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
