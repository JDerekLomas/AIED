REASONING: This question requires students to recall basic science concepts about decomposition and apply them to a practical scenario, including evaluating the benefits. While the concept of decomposition might be familiar, articulating the 'why' and 'how' it benefits soil health moves beyond simple recall. This will be harder than the 50% anchor, as it requires more than direct extraction from text, but easier than the 5% anchor which required abstract thematic understanding. It's similar in cognitive demand to the 15% anchor (differentiating sources) but perhaps slightly more accessible due to everyday relevance.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
