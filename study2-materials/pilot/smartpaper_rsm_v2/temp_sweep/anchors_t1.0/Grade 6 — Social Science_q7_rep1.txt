REASONING: This question is comparable to the 66% anchor item (Fundamental Rights) as it requires recalling specific factual information (two natural resources) and applying basic understanding (explaining influence). It's slightly more complex due to the "how it influences" part, but still within the recall-based difficulty level, making it easier than the "differentiate" or "theme" questions.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
