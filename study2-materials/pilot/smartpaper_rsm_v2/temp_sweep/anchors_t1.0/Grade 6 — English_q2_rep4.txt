REASONING: This question is a direct recall question about a specific detail from a text, similar to the 50% pass rate anchor item about the king's questions. However, "who lived inside the book?" is a single, clear answer, likely explicitly stated and easier to extract than remembering three distinct questions.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
