REASONING: This item is harder than the "Three Questions" and "Fundamental Rights" items because it requires interpretation and personal connection, similar to the "Favorite Season" item but with a literary rather than personal focus. However, it's easier than "The Last Bargain" or "Archaeological Sources" as it doesn't require abstract thematic understanding or factual recall of definitions. Students can simply pick any line and provide a basic reason.
