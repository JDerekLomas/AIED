REASONING: This question is harder than the "Three Questions" and "Fundamental Rights" items because it requires interpretation and personal connection, rather than just recall. It's comparable to "My Favorite Season" in requiring a personal response, but potentially harder as it asks for a specific line *and* a reason, which can be challenging for students who struggle with expressing abstract ideas. It's easier than "The Last Bargain" theme question as it doesn't require synthesizing the entire poem's meaning, just identifying a line and a simple reason. It's significantly easier than "Archaeological vs. Literary Sources" as it doesn't require factual differentiation and definition.
