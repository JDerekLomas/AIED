REASONING: This question is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving time and rate, which is a common skill taught in Class 6. Students often struggle with word problems or multi-step problems, but this one is relatively simple: find the difference in hours and multiply by the rate. It is likely to be easier than most of the anchor items, especially those requiring analytical thinking (like the poem's theme) or recall of specific facts (like historical sources or fundamental rights). It is comparable to the "king's questions" in terms of direct information retrieval/calculation, but requires one more step.
