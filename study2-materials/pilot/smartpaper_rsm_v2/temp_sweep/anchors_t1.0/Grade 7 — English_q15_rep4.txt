REASONING: This item is comparable to the "My Favorite Season" anchor item (30% pass rate) in terms of requiring paragraph writing and personal expression, but it's slightly easier as "hobby" might be a more common and accessible topic for students than "season," and the sentence count is slightly lower (4-5 vs 6-8). The instructions are also quite clear on what to include.
