REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) as it requires recalling specific facts taught in class. While "occupations" is a common theme, applying it to a specific region like Rajasthan might make it slightly harder for some students compared to general fundamental rights. However, the expectation is only to name two and briefly describe one, making it quite achievable for students who have studied the geography and economy of Rajasthan.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
