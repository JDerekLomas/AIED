REASONING: This item is similar in structure and required output to the "My favorite season" prompt (30% pass rate), but the content is arguably more relatable and personally accessible for students than a season, making it slightly easier. It also requires a shorter paragraph (4-5 sentences vs. 6-8) and has a simpler scoring rubric (1 mark for a complete paragraph with required elements). This makes it more attainable than the "My favourite season" question, but still challenging given the writing demands. It's much harder than the factual recall questions with higher pass rates, and easier than the complex "Last Bargain" theme question.
