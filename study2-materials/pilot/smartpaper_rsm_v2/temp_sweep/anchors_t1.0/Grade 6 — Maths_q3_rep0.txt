REASONING: This question involves a basic mathematical concept (ascending order) that is typically covered and practiced extensively in Class 6. Unlike the English and Social Science anchor items which require recall of information, comprehension, or creative writing, this question is a straightforward application of a taught skill. The difficulty is further reduced because the rubric only requires identifying the smallest number and placing it first, not the complete correct order. This is significantly easier than all the anchor items, especially the English poem and History differentiation which show very low pass rates due to conceptual difficulty, vocabulary, or the need for elaborated responses.
