REASONING: This item requires an understanding of grammatical transformation, which is often challenging for students at this level. While it's a direct application of a grammar rule, the abstract nature of "voice" might be more difficult than direct factual recall (like Fundamental Rights or the King's questions) or even simple paragraph writing. It's likely harder than the 50% pass rate item but potentially easier than the poetry theme or historical sources, as it has a single, clear correct answer rather than requiring interpretation or multiple distinct pieces of information.
