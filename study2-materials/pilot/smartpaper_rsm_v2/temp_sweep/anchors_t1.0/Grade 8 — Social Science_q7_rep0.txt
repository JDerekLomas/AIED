REASONING: This question requires recall of specific historical events and their impact, similar to the "Fundamental Rights" question but requiring more detailed factual knowledge and a cause-and-effect understanding rather than just naming. It's likely harder than simply naming rights, but easier than the literary analysis or the detailed differentiation, and definitely easier than the "Last Bargain" question which requires abstract thematic understanding.
