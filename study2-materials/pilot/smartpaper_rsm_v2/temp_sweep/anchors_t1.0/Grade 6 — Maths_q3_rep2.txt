REASONING: This question tests a basic mathematical concept of ordering numbers, which is fundamental and typically covered early in Class 6. Unlike the English and Social Science anchor items which require recall of specific information, interpretation, or paragraph writing, this question is a direct application of numerical understanding. While some students might struggle with attention to detail or place value, it's significantly more straightforward than the 5% and 15% pass rate items, and even easier than the 50% and 66% pass rate items which still require comprehension of a passage or memorization of specific facts.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
