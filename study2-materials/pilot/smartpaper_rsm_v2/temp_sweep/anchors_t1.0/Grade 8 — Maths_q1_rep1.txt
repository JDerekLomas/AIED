REASONING: This item involves a basic linear equation with a simple subtraction, which is a fundamental concept taught in Class 8. Students are likely to have practiced similar problems extensively. While some might make errors with negative numbers, the operation is direct. It's significantly easier than the English comprehension (poem theme, paragraph writing) or social studies questions, and more direct than the "three questions the king wanted to answer" which requires recalling details. It's comparable to, if not slightly easier than, naming two fundamental rights, as it requires a direct calculation rather than recall of specific knowledge.
