REASONING: This question requires students to recall information about decomposition, relate it to everyday observations, and then evaluate its benefit for soil health. It's more complex than simply recalling facts (like Fundamental Rights) or copying from a passage (like the King's questions), but less abstract than identifying a poem's theme. The requirement to "give reasons and evaluate" adds layers of understanding beyond simple identification or definition. Given the low pass rates on questions requiring interpretation or multi-step reasoning, this question will likely be difficult. The open-ended nature of the "reasons and evaluate" part might also lead to partial or incomplete answers.
