REASONING: This item is significantly easier than the anchor items. It tests basic sentence structure, a skill taught early and reinforced constantly in Class 6 English, unlike abstract themes, historical differentiation, or even detailed paragraph writing. It's also less prone to 'empty responses' as students will likely attempt it. It is most comparable to "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" but without the need to recall information from a passage, just apply grammatical rules.
