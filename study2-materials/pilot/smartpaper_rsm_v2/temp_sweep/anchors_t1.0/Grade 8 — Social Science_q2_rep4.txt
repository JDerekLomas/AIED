REASONING: This question is comparable to the 66% pass rate anchor item as it asks for a specific factual recall that is likely covered directly in textbooks and taught explicitly. It is slightly more complex than just naming two items, but still a direct recall. It is easier than the 50% pass rate item because it asks for one key feature rather than three.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
