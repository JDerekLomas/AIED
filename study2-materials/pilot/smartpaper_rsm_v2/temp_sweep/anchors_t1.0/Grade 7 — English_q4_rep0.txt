REASONING: This question is slightly harder than the 50% anchor item because it requires an inferential leap and personal opinion, not just recalling information from the passage. However, it's easier than the 30% anchor as it only asks for one reason and doesn't require paragraph construction or detailed descriptions. The language is also simpler than the 15% anchor.
