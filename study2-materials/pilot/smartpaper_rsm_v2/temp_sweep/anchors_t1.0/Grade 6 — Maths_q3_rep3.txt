REASONING: This question is significantly easier than the anchor items. It tests a fundamental mathematical concept (ascending order of numbers) that Class 6 students would have practiced extensively, likely since Class 3 or 4. Unlike the English and Social Science anchors, which require comprehension, abstract thinking, or recall of specific facts, this question is a direct application of a learned skill. The low pass rates for the anchor items suggest challenges with language comprehension, complex reasoning, and essay writing. This math question avoids those pitfalls. The rubric for this specific question is also quite lenient, only requiring the correct identification of the smallest number and its placement first for partial credit, which further increases the likelihood of a high pass rate.
