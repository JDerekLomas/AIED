REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" question in terms of requiring recall of two specific facts, but it adds a simple explanation component which makes it slightly harder. It's likely easier than the "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" as it doesn't require differentiation or complex definitions.
