REASONING: This question is about a grammatical transformation, which often requires understanding rules and applying them, similar to the "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" question, but perhaps a bit more straightforward in its application once the rule is known. It's likely harder than simply recalling facts or directly copying from a passage.
