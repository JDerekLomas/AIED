REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66%) as it asks for a specific factual recall from the syllabus. It's slightly harder than naming two rights because "urban planning" is a more conceptual category, but it only requires one feature. It's easier than differentiating between archaeological and literary sources because it doesn't require a comparison.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
