REASONING: This question requires students to recall knowledge about decomposition, connect it to practical observation, and understand its impact on soil health. While the concept of decomposition is taught, articulating the "why" and "beneficial for soil health" part makes it harder than simple recall (like Fundamental Rights) or direct passage retrieval (like the King's questions). However, it's less abstract and open to interpretation than the poem's theme, and less reliant on specific historical terminology than the sources question. The "give reasons and evaluate" part might challenge some students to go beyond a simple "yes, it changes."
