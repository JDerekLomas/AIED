REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "My favorite season" and "Three questions the king wanted to answer" anchors. While it requires identifying a specific line from the poem and providing a personal reason, the "why" can be simple and doesn't require deep analytical thought. Students have direct access to the poem (which wasn't the case for the theme question), making recall easier.
