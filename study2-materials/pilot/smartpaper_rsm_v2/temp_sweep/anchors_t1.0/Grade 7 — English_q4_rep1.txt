REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" anchor (50% pass rate) as it relies on recalling information from the passage. However, it also requires a simple opinion and justification, which might slightly increase the difficulty for some students compared to a direct recall question, but the expectation for the reason is broad. Given the relatively high pass rates for recall and simple opinion/justification questions, it's likely to be slightly above the 50% mark.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
