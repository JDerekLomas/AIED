REASONING: This question is a direct application of a formula taught in Class 7 mathematics. Compared to the anchor items, it requires recall of a specific formula and simple calculation, which is generally easier than abstract thematic interpretation, historical differentiation, or paragraph writing. The pass rates for the anchor items suggest that direct recall of facts (like Fundamental Rights) has a higher pass rate than more complex tasks. This question is similar in cognitive demand to recalling fundamental rights but in a mathematical context, which students often find more straightforward than language or social science.
