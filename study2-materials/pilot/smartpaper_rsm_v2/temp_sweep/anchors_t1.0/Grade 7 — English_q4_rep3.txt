REASONING: This question requires students to recall the king's questions (like the 50% pass rate anchor) but then also make a personal connection and provide a simple reason, which is a slightly higher cognitive demand than just recall but not as complex as theme identification or differentiating historical sources. The open-ended nature of "one reason" provides an opportunity for many students to give a plausible answer, making it easier than the "Last Bargain" theme question. It is harder than the Fundamental Rights recall.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
