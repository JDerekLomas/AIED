REASONING: This item is significantly easier than the anchor items. It tests a basic grammatical concept (some/any) that is often covered early in English language learning and can be answered correctly with minimal reading comprehension or analytical skills, unlike the theme, differentiation, or paragraph writing tasks. It is comparable to the Fundamental Rights question in that it is a direct recall/application, but even simpler in concept.
