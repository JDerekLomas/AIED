REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the 50% pass rate anchor item, as it requires recall of specific facts and a basic explanation, which is slightly more complex than just naming but less abstract than identifying themes. The 66% anchor is purely recall, making this question slightly harder.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
