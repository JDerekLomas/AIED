**Reasoning:**  
The task requires constructing a coherent paragraph with three specific details. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with sentence structure, tense usage, and vocabulary. The "struggling" group would find it hard to write complete sentences in English. The "basic" group might manage simple sentences but often miss one element (e.g., forgetting "when" or a clear "why"). The "competent" and "advanced" groups are more likely to meet all rubric points, though minor grammatical errors in the competent group could sometimes obscure clarity.
