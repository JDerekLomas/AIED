**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both **recall** (finding/remembering a line) and **simple reasoning** (explaining why). Many struggling students have difficulty reading the poem itself and forming a complete sentence in English to justify their choice. Basic-level students can often recall a line but struggle to articulate a clear "why" due to limited vocabulary and sentence structure. Competent students generally manage both parts adequately, though some may give vague reasons. Advanced students handle it well. Common mistakes include copying a line incorrectly, giving a reason unrelated to the line, or writing the reason in Hindi/translating poorly.
