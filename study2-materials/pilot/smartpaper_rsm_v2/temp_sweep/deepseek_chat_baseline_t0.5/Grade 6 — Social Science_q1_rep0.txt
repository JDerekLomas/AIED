struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This is a pure recall question from geography. However, the English phrasing ("mountain ranges located in India") can be a barrier. Many struggling students may not understand "mountain ranges" clearly or may confuse it with hills or local landforms. They might recall "Himalaya" but not a second one. Basic-level students, with some vocabulary support in class, can often name the Himalayas and one other (like Aravalli or Vindhya), but spelling/English name recall can still cost marks. Competent students are comfortable with the key terms and can recall at least two. Advanced students almost always get it, though occasional spelling errors ("Himalyas") might lead to partial marking issues. In a Hindi-medium context, if the question is read aloud and explained, performance in basic and competent groups would improve, but the percentages reflect a written English test scenario.
