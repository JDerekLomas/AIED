**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: **recall** (of the three questions from the text) and **simple reasoning** (to connect one of them to "real life" importance). The main barrier is language comprehension of the question itself. Many struggling students, due to limited English proficiency, may not understand "important in real life" or may fail to recall the specific questions from the passage. Basic-level students can often recall but might give an incomplete or vague reason. Competent students typically manage both recall and a valid connection. Advanced students handle it easily. A common mistake is to narrate the story instead of giving a focused reason, or to misinterpret the question as asking if the king's *answers* (not questions) are important.
