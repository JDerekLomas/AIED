struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 30% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling group:** Most cannot identify subject/verb/object in English. Converting tense (blew → were blown) and adding "by" is highly challenging. Common mistakes include writing "The leaves is blown" or copying the sentence as is.  
- **Basic group:** Some can identify "leaves" as object to move to front, but tense change and preposition "by" are often missed (e.g., "The leaves blown away wind"). Partial credit scenarios would be common, but for full marks, only about 30% get all elements correct.  
- **Competent group:** Understand the structure well. Mistakes occasionally occur with irregular past participle ("blowed" instead of "blown") or omitting "away." Majority can recall the passive form with reasonable accuracy.  
- **Advanced group:** Near-perfect recall, but rare slips in article ("by the wind") might occur. High confidence in application.
