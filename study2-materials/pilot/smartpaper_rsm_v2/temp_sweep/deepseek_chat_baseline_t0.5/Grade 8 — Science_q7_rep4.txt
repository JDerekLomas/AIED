**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding of decomposition and composting, which is part of the Class 8 Science syllabus (Chapter: Microorganisms). However, many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds struggle with the English phrasing of "notice any change," "give reasons," and "evaluate."  

- **Struggling (35%):** Most will not attempt or will give incomplete answers due to language barriers and weak conceptual recall. Common mistake: writing "yes" without explanation.  
- **Basic (35%):** Some will recall that the waste rots or becomes manure, but may not clearly link it to soil health or give specific reasons. Language limits expression.  
- **Competent (20%):** Majority will correctly state that waste decomposes, becomes compost, and improves soil fertility, though may lack detail on microorganisms' role.  
- **Advanced (10%):** Nearly all will give a complete answer with reasons (microbial action, humus formation) and explicitly connect it to soil health benefits.
