**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive word (e.g., simple, descriptive). For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, this is challenging because:  
1. **Language barrier:** Many struggling students cannot comprehend the question itself.  
2. **Vocabulary gap:** Words like "style," "descriptive," or "informal" may not be in their active vocabulary.  
3. **Recall vs. reasoning:** It demands both comprehension of the poet's work (likely from a lesson) and the ability to label it with an appropriate term, which is higher-order than simple recall.  
4. **Common mistakes:** Students often copy lines from the poem instead of describing the style, or they leave it blank due to lack of confidence.  

The **struggling** group largely won’t attempt or will give irrelevant answers. The **basic** group might manage if the style was explicitly taught (e.g., "The poet uses simple language."). The **competent** group can often deduce or recall the correct descriptor. The **advanced** group typically understands and answers accurately.
