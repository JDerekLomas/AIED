**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires recall of specific resource names from Rajasthan. Many struggling students have poor English reading comprehension and may not recall the exact terms, often confusing resources (e.g., writing "stone" instead of "sandstone" or "marble"). Basic-level students might recall one resource but struggle to correctly name two and explain influence clearly. Competent students generally manage both parts, though some may give vague explanations. Advanced students handle it well, but a few may overcomplicate the explanation or miss a specific term. The rubric is lenient (many examples given), but language and recall remain barriers for the weaker groups.
