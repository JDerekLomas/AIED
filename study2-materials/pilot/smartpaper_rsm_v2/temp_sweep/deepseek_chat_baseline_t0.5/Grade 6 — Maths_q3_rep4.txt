**Reasoning:**  
- The question is in English, so language is a barrier for many in the struggling group. They may not understand "ascending order" or confuse digit places.  
- It requires comparing numbers with different digits (3-digit vs. 4-digit), which is a basic reasoning skill taught in earlier classes.  
- Struggling students often misalign digits while comparing or get overwhelmed by larger numbers.  
- Basic-level students generally grasp place value comparison but may make careless errors in ordering all four numbers correctly.  
- Competent and advanced students are very familiar with such tasks and are likely to order correctly, though a few in competent group may rush and misorder the middle two large numbers.
