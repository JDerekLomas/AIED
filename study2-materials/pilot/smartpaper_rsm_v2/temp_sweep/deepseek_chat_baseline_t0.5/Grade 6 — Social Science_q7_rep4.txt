**Reasoning:**  
The question has two clear parts: **recalling** two resources and **explaining** one’s influence.  
- **Language barrier:** The question is in English; many struggling/basic students may not fully understand “natural resources” or “influences the lives,” even if they know the local examples.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Listing resources is pure recall (e.g., salt, sunlight), but explaining influence requires connecting cause-effect in simple English/Hindi terms, which is harder for weaker students.  
- **Specificity:** They must name correct resources (some may give incorrect examples like “oil” or “forests,” which are less relevant to Rajasthan).  
- **Common mistakes:** Mixing up resources from other states, writing vague explanations (“it gives jobs”), or copying incomplete lines from the textbook without clear meaning.  

Advanced students handle both parts easily; competent ones manage with minor explanation issues. Basic students often get one resource right but struggle with a clear explanation. Struggling students are likely to leave it blank or write unrelated answers due to language and conceptual gaps.
