**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive adjective. Many struggling and basic-level students, due to limited English proficiency and Hindi-medium background, would find terms like "descriptive" or "informal" unfamiliar. They might not grasp what "writing style" means or may copy irrelevant lines from the poem. Competent students can often identify a simple, relevant word if taught explicitly, while advanced learners can reason and select accurately. Common mistakes include leaving it blank, writing a phrase instead of one word, or describing the poem's theme instead of style.
