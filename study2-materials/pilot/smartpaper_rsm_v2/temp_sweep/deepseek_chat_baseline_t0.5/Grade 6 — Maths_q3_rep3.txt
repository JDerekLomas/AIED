**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The instruction is in English, but the task itself only involves comparing digits. Many struggling students may not understand "ascending order" without Hindi support, but some might recognize the pattern from practice.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires comparing numbers by looking at the number of digits first (736 has 3 digits, others have 4), which is a reasoning skill taught repeatedly. Struggling students often forget this rule and compare digit-by-digit incorrectly.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric awards 0.5 only for identifying the smallest number first. Many basic-level students might arrange all four correctly, but some might misorder the larger numbers and lose credit.  
- **Common mistakes:** Mixing ascending/descending order, comparing only the first digit (e.g., thinking 3367 is smallest because it starts with 3), or writing numbers in the order given.  

Given these factors, even many basic-level students can identify 736 as smallest, but only those with secure understanding will consistently place it first as per the rubric.
