advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question requires simple recall of a specific detail ("magical fairy") from a text. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the main barriers are vocabulary (understanding "magical fairy" and the question structure "Who lived inside...?") and the ability to locate/retain that detail from English text.  

- **Struggling (35%):** Most would find it hard to comprehend the question or scan the text for the answer. Some might guess "king" or "queen" from illustrations, or leave it blank. Only a few with better recall might score.  
- **Basic (35%):** With support, they can often locate answers in the text, but might write "a fairy" or "magical fairy" incompletely or with spelling errors ("feri"). The rubric accepts 'fairy', so around 40% would get it.  
- **Competent (20%):** They can read and comprehend the text well. Most would recall or find the exact answer, though some might overcomplicate it.  
- **Advanced (10%):** Near-perfect recall, but a small percentage might write "a fairy" instead of "magical fairy" if the rubric is strictly applied, though the rubric accepts both.
