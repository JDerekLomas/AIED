**Reasoning:**  
This item tests the basic grammar rule of using "some" in affirmative statements and "any" in questions/negatives. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the concept of countable nouns and article/determiner usage is often transferred incorrectly from Hindi, where such distinctions don't exist in the same way.  

- **Struggling students** (35%) often guess or confuse "some" and "any" due to lack of exposure and practice. Many cannot read the sentence with comprehension.  
- **Basic level students** (35%) might recognize the pattern from rote learning ("some" for positive sentences) but still make frequent mistakes under exam pressure.  
- **Competent students** (20%) are likely to have internalized this rule through repeated exercises and would get it right most of the time.  
- **Advanced students** (10%) would almost certainly answer correctly, as this is a foundational grammar point they have mastered.  

Common mistakes include choosing "any" because it feels more familiar from questions like "Are there any apples?" or due to direct translation from Hindi.
