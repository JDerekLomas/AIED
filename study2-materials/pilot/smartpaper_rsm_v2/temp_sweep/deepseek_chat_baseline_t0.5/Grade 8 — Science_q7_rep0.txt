struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 20% full marks  
competent: 60% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students would struggle to comprehend "notice any change," "reasons," and "evaluate... beneficial for soil health," even if they know the concept practically.  
- **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires both recall (knowing about compost decomposition) and reasoning (linking change to reasons and soil health). Struggling students often miss the "reasons" or "evaluate" part even if they recall change.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric expects "significant changes" (like smell, heat, reduction in volume, formation of compost) and explicit connection to soil health (adds nutrients/humus). Competent and advanced students can structure this; others might only state "it becomes compost" without reasons or evaluation.  
- **Common Mistakes:**  
  - Vague answers: "Yes, it rots." (No reasons/benefit)  
  - Misunderstanding: "It becomes waste, harmful for soil."  
  - Language: Copying phrases from question without explanation.  
  - Missing evaluation: Only describing change, not stating benefit to soil.  

Advanced students score high as they grasp full demand; competent students often miss some details. Basic students partially answer; struggling students are largely derailed by language and conceptual gaps.
