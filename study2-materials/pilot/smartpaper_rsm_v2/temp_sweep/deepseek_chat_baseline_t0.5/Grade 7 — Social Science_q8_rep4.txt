struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for many Hindi-medium students. While the content (rural occupations of Rajasthan) is familiar from their textbook and surroundings, the phrasing may not be fully understood by struggling learners. It requires **recall** of specific terms taught in class (like "animal husbandry" vs. colloquial "rearing animals").  

Common mistakes include:  
1. Writing only one occupation instead of two.  
2. Using local terms (e.g., "mochi work") instead of the broader category ("handicrafts").  
3. Misreading the question and describing urban occupations.  

The **struggling** group would largely fail due to language and recall gaps. The **basic** group might manage if they recall key terms from rote learning. The **competent** and **advanced** groups are more likely to understand the English question and reproduce the textbook answers accurately.
