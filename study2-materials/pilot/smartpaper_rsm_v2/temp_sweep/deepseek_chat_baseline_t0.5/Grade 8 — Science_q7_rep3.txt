**Reasoning:**  
This question requires connecting the decomposition of organic waste to soil health, which involves reasoning beyond simple recall. Many struggling students would not attempt or fully comprehend the English phrasing. Basic-level students might grasp the change (like rotting) but often fail to clearly link it to soil enrichment or give incomplete reasons. Competent students can explain decomposition and benefits, but may lack precise terms (e.g., compost, humus). Advanced students comfortably articulate the process and its benefits. Common mistakes include vague answers ("it becomes soil"), missing the reason-benefit connection, or confusing it with burning waste. Language barriers significantly impact the struggling and basic groups.
