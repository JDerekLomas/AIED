**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, so even with limited English, students can identify it as a simple algebra problem.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires understanding inverse operations (subtraction to isolate \( y \)) and handling negative numbers, which is a conceptual hurdle for many.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  - Adding 9 to both sides (getting \( y = 13 \))  
  - Writing \( y = 5 \) (ignoring the negative sign)  
  - Leaving the answer as \( y = 4 - 9 \) without simplifying  
- **Struggling group:** Most will not recall how to handle negative results or inverse operations correctly.  
- **Basic group:** About half can perform the subtraction \( 4 - 9 \) and recognize the answer as \(-5\).  
- **Competent/Advanced:** Nearly all will solve it correctly, though a few in the competent group might make careless errors.
