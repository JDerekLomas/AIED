**Reasoning:**  
This question requires **recall** of a specific, well-known fact from the chapter. However, the **language of the question (English)** is a significant barrier for many, especially the struggling and basic groups. Even if taught in Hindi, the need to read and comprehend the English prompt can cause confusion. Students often **recall the concept but describe it in vague or incorrect terms** (e.g., saying "good roads" instead of "grid pattern," or "they had bathrooms" instead of "advanced drainage system with covered pipes"). The competent and advanced groups, having better English comprehension and recall, are more likely to reproduce the exact key feature as per the textbook. The struggling group would mostly fail to attempt or write an irrelevant point.
