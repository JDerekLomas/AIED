**Reasoning:**  
This item tests the basic grammar rule of using "some" in affirmative statements and "any" in questions/negatives. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the concept of countable/uncountable nouns and article/determiner usage is often transferred incorrectly from Hindi. Many struggle with reading the sentence itself, and "any" might seem more familiar because it's commonly heard in questions ("Are there any?"). The question requires recall of a specific rule, not deep reasoning, but students with limited exposure frequently mix up "some" and "any" in writing, even if they understand generally. The advanced group will mostly know it, while the struggling group will largely guess or default to "any."
