struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is short and numbers are given, so even students with limited English can often identify “base,” “height,” and the numbers 8 and 6. However, struggling students may still be confused by the English phrasing.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is direct recall and application of a standard formula taught repeatedly in Class 6 and 7. No complex reasoning is needed.  
- **Specificity of answer:** The rubric only requires stating or using the correct formula. Even if calculation errors occur later, if they write `Area = 1/2 × 8 × 6`, they would get full marks. Many competent and advanced students will do this correctly.  
- **Common mistakes:** Struggling students often forget the `1/2`, multiply base and height directly, or confuse area with perimeter. Basic-level students sometimes recall the formula but make arithmetic errors, though the rubric here is generous as it focuses on formula use.  

Given the rubric’s focus on formula rather than final numerical answer, basic and above students have a high chance of scoring full marks, while struggling students still face challenges due to weak conceptual retention and language issues.
