advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This is a pure recall question from geography. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English names of mountain ranges (e.g., "Western Ghats" instead of "Sahyadri") can be a barrier. Many struggling students might know the Hindi/local terms but fail to recall or recognize the standard English terms used in the textbook. The basic group has some familiarity but may confuse similar-sounding names (e.g., Vindhya vs. Satpura) or misspell. Competent students are likely to recall at least two correctly, though occasional spelling errors may occur. Advanced students will recall easily, as this is straightforward factual knowledge for them.
