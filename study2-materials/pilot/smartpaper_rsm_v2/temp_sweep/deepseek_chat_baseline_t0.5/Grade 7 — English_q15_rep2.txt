**Reasoning:**  
The task requires constructing a coherent paragraph with three specific details, which is challenging for students with limited English proficiency. Many struggling students will write incomplete sentences, miss one required element (often "why"), or rely on memorized phrases incorrectly. Basic-level students may manage simple sentences but often struggle with sequencing and clarity on "when" and "why." Competent students typically follow the structure but may have minor errors. Advanced students usually meet all criteria comfortably. The main barriers are vocabulary for hobbies and reasons, and the ability to link ideas in English rather than direct translation from Hindi.
