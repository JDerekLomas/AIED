**Reasoning:**  
The item requires precise recall of a specific literary term definition. The language of the rubric itself ("imparts a moral lesson") is complex for many. Struggling students often confuse fable with other story types (like fairy tales) or cannot articulate the definition in English. Basic-level students may recall it uses animals but often miss the "moral lesson" part. Competent students typically grasp and reproduce both key elements. Advanced students almost always score full marks, with rare errors due to wording. The main barrier is not reasoning but English vocabulary recall and the ability to match taught concepts to exact phrasing.
