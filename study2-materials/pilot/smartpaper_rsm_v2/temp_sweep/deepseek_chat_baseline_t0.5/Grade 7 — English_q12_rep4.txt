**Reasoning:**  
This item requires specific grammatical knowledge (passive voice structure: object + helping verb "were" + past participle "blown" + "by" + agent). Many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds struggle with English verb forms (blew/blown) and the auxiliary "were" for plural "leaves." Common mistakes include: "The leaves was blown away," "The leaves blown away by wind," or omitting "by the wind." The struggling group often cannot identify the object or recall the past participle. The basic group might attempt but make structural errors. The competent and advanced groups are more familiar with the pattern, though some may forget the plural verb agreement.
