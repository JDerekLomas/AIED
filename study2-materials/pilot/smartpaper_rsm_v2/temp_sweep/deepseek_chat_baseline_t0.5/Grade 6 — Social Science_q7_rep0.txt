competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question has two clear parts: recall two resources and explain one’s influence.  
- **Language barrier:** The question is in English; many struggling/basic students may not fully comprehend “influences the lives,” leading to incomplete answers.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Listing resources is pure recall (easier), but explaining influence requires connecting cause-effect in simple English/Hindi (harder for many).  
- **Specificity:** Students often list vague or incorrect resources (e.g., “oil,” “coal” for Rajasthan) or give overly generic explanations (“water is useful”).  
- **Common mistakes:** Mixing up minerals, forgetting to explain, or copying incomplete textbook lines without applying to “lives of people.”  

Advanced students handle both parts well. Competent ones usually recall correctly but may give weaker explanations. Basic students often get one resource right but struggle with explanation. Struggling students frequently miss the question’s demand due to language and conceptual gaps.
