struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is numeric, so language is not a major hurdle here. However, some struggling students may not understand "ascending order" even after demonstration, but since it is a repeated class activity, many have been exposed to the term.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires comparing numbers by looking at the number of digits first (736 has 3 digits, others have 4), which is a reasoning step taught repeatedly. Struggling students often forget this rule and compare digit-by-digit incorrectly.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric only requires identifying the smallest number and placing it first for full marks, which is lenient. Many basic-level students can do this, but some may still place 736 later if they confuse ascending/descending.  
- **Common mistakes:** Mixing up ascending/descending, comparing only first digits without considering total digits (e.g., thinking 3367 is smallest because it starts with 3), and careless ordering errors.  

Given the rubric’s partial credit approach (0.5 marks just for putting 736 first), even many basic students can score full marks, but struggling students often make the mistakes mentioned.
