struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, so even with limited English, many can decode “y + 9 = 4”. However, struggling students may freeze seeing English letters.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires understanding inverse operations (subtract 9 from both sides). Struggling students often add instead of subtract or ignore the equal sign.  
- **Specificity of answer:** Only `y = -5` is correct. Many basic-level students might answer `y = 13` (adding 9 and 4) or `y = 5` (ignoring the negative).  
- **Common mistakes:** Fear of negative numbers, misreading the operation, or leaving the answer as `y + 9 - 9 = 4 - 9` without simplifying.  
- **Experience:** Competent and advanced students handle such one-step equations well, but negative numbers still trip some in the basic group.
