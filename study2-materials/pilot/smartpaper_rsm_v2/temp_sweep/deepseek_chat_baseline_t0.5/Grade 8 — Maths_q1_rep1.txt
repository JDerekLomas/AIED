struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, so even with limited English, students can identify it as a simple algebra problem. However, struggling students may be intimidated by the English letters and symbols.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires basic reasoning (inverse operation) rather than memorization. Struggling students often fail to apply “subtract 9 from both sides” or incorrectly add instead of subtract.  
- **Specificity of answer:** Only `y = -5` is correct. Many basic-level students might answer `y = 13` (adding 9 and 4) or `y = 5`, missing the negative sign.  
- **Common mistakes:** Fear of negative numbers, misreading the operation, or leaving the answer as `4 – 9` without simplifying. Competent and advanced students are comfortable with integers and inverse operations, hence high success rates.
