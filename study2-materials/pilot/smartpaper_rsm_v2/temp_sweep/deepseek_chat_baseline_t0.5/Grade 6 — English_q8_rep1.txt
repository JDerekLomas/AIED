**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** often cannot identify the subject ("He") or the verb ("is reading") due to limited vocabulary and unfamiliarity with English sentence structure. Many will jumble the words or write "book is he a reading."  
- **Basic level students** may recognize common words like "book" and "he" but often struggle with correct word order, especially the auxiliary verb "is" + "reading." Some may produce "He reading a book is" or omit "a." Around 40% might arrive at the correct order through trial and error or basic intuition.  
- **Competent students** understand subject-verb-object patterns and can apply basic grammar rules. However, some may still confuse article placement or verb form. The majority will get it right.  
- **Advanced students** will easily recognize the structure and rearrange correctly without hesitation.
