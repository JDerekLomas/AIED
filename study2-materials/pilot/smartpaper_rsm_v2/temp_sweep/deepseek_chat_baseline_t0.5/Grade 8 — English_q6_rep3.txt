**Reasoning:**  
The item requires a precise, textbook-style definition. While "fable" is a known concept, the rubric demands recall of specific elements (short story, animals as characters, moral lesson).  

- **Struggling students** (5%): Severe language barriers and difficulty retaining formal definitions. They may recall it's a story with animals but often miss the "moral lesson" part or cannot phrase it in English.  
- **Basic students** (40%): Can grasp the core idea and may have heard the term, but under exam pressure, their recall is often incomplete (e.g., "story with animals" without the moral). Writing in English is a hurdle.  
- **Competent students** (85%): Understand and recall the definition well. Occasional errors come from omitting one element (like "short" or specifying animals) under time pressure.  
- **Advanced students** (95%): Near-perfect recall. The rare miss is due to overcomplication or minor wording deviation.
