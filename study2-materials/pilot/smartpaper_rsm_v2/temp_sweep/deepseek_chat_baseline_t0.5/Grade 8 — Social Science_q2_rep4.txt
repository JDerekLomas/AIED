struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This question tests direct recall of a textbook fact, which is often taught with visual aids (maps, diagrams) and Hindi explanations in class. However, the English phrasing of the question itself is a barrier.  

- **Struggling (35%):** Most will not understand "key feature" or "urban planning" in English. Even if they know the concept in Hindi, writing it correctly in English is a major hurdle. A few might recall "drainage system" as a familiar term.  
- **Basic (35%):** With some vocabulary support in class, many can grasp the question. They might recall one feature but often write vague or incomplete answers (e.g., "bricks" instead of "standardized baked bricks"). Language errors can cost them the mark.  
- **Competent (20%):** They understand the English terms from repeated practice. Can accurately recall and write one feature, though may occasionally miss specificity (e.g., not mentioning "grid pattern" clearly).  
- **Advanced (10%):** High recall accuracy and can express the answer in clear, specific English as per the rubric.
