**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires a specific recall of the political consequence (establishing control through a puppet ruler). Many struggling students would not grasp the phrasing or recall the precise link. Basic-level students might recall "British won power" but often miss the "puppet nawab" or "control over Bengal" specificity. Competent students generally understand the key cause-effect, though some may express it imperfectly. Advanced students can accurately articulate the required point. Common mistakes include confusing Plassey with other battles, describing only the war events without the political outcome, or writing vague statements like "British became strong."
