**Reasoning:**  
The task requires constructing a coherent paragraph with three specific details, which is challenging for students with limited English proficiency. The **struggling** group often cannot write complete sentences or stick to the topic. The **basic** group may manage simple sentences but frequently miss one element (usually "why") or make grammatical errors that break clarity. The **competent** and **advanced** groups can typically follow the rubric, though minor errors may still cost a few in the competent group. The topic is familiar and requires recall, not complex reasoning, which helps, but language barriers are the primary constraint.
