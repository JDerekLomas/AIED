**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires a specific recall of the political consequence (establishing control through a puppet ruler). Many struggling students would not grasp the phrasing or recall the precise link. Basic-level students might recall "British won power" but often miss the "how" (Mir Jafar, puppet nawab). Competent students generally understand the cause-effect and can express it, though language may limit precision. Advanced students comfortably connect the battle to the mechanism of control. Common mistakes include vague answers ("British became strong"), mixing up Plassey with other battles, or not mentioning puppet arrangement due to textbook language barriers.
