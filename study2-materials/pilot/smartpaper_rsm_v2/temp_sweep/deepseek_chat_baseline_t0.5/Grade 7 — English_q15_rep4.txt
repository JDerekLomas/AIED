**Reasoning:**  
The task requires constructing a coherent paragraph with three specific details. For the **struggling** group, significant language barriers and difficulty forming complete sentences mean most will omit one required element or write disjointed phrases. The **basic** group can often list the hobby and time but may struggle to clearly articulate "why" in a full sentence, with errors in grammar affecting clarity. The **competent** group typically manages all elements, though with minor mistakes. The **advanced** group almost always meets the rubric, with only occasional slips in focus. The task relies on personal recall and simple sentence formation, but for Hindi-medium students, transferring ideas into structured English paragraphs is the key hurdle.
