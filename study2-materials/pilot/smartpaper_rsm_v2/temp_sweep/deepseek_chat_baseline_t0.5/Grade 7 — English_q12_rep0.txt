**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling (5%):** Most in this group have very limited grasp of sentence structure, verb forms, and the concept of voice. They often confuse subjects and objects. The need to change verb tense ("blew" to "were blown") and rearrange words is a significant barrier. Only a few with rote memory might recall a pattern.  
- **Basic (30%):** These students understand basic subject-verb-object sentences but applying the passive rule is challenging. Common mistakes include: forgetting the past participle ("blown"), using "was" instead of "were" (subject-verb agreement error with "leaves"), or omitting "by the wind." About a third might manage it correctly with some recall from recent teaching.  
- **Competent (75%):** They grasp the rule and can apply it to this straightforward sentence. Some might still make minor errors in agreement or preposition use, but most will produce the correct structure, especially if the topic was recently taught and practiced.  
- **Advanced (95%):** They handle this transformation easily. The rare error might be a slip in writing, not a lack of understanding.
