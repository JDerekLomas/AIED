**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily isolate individual words by function in an English sentence. They may confuse "tiny bird" as a single unit or pick "in our balcony" as a phrase.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires knowing the definition of an *adjective* (recall) and applying it to find the single describing word (reasoning). Struggling students often lack both.  
- **Specificity:** The answer must be exactly "tiny." Common mistakes include choosing "tiny bird" (noun phrase) or "in our balcony" (prepositional phrase).  
- **Common mistakes:** Hindi-medium students sometimes translate directly, where word order differs, leading to confusion. Also, some may not know the term "adjective" itself in any language. Advanced students typically get it correct, with rare slips.
