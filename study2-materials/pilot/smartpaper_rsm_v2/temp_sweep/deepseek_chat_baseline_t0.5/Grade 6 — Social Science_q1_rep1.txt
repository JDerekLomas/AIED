struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is purely recall-based from geography, but the English phrasing ("mountain ranges located in India") can be a barrier. Many struggling students might know local or Hindi names (e.g., "Himalaya") but may not recognize the term "mountain ranges" or may write only one name. Basic-level students often recall the Himalayas but struggle to name a second range confidently (e.g., might confuse Aravalli with a local hill). Competent students usually know at least two major ranges, and advanced students are very likely to recall them correctly, though occasional spelling errors ("Aravali" vs "Aravalli") may occur. The rubric is lenient (any two correct examples), which helps, but recall depends heavily on recent revision and medium of instruction.
