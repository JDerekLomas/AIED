struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
- **Struggling students (10%)**: Most will not correctly calculate the 6-hour time difference due to difficulty in converting "10 am to 4:00 in the evening" into hours, especially with limited English comprehension. Some may add 2°C only once or misuse the per-hour rate.  
- **Basic students (40%)**: About half may grasp the time interval and multiplication concept, but errors in arithmetic (like 6 × 2) or misunderstanding "evening" as 4 am are common. Language still poses a barrier.  
- **Competent students (80%)**: They usually understand the problem structure, compute 6 hours and multiply correctly, though occasional slips in time calculation or addition may occur.  
- **Advanced students (95%)**: Nearly all solve accurately; rare mistakes might come from misreading the question rather than conceptual gaps.
