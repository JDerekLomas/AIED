**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires a specific recall of the political consequence (establishing control through a puppet ruler). Many struggling students would not grasp the English phrasing or recall the precise link. Basic-level students might recall "British won power" but often miss the "puppet nawab" or "political dominance" phrasing. Competent students generally understand the cause-effect and can express it, though language may still simplify the answer. Advanced students clearly articulate the required point. Common mistakes include vague answers ("British became strong"), confusing Plassey with other battles, or not naming Mir Jafar/puppet rule due to memorization gaps.
