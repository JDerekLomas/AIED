struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The problem is short and numbers are clear, but some struggling students may not fully grasp “temperature increases by 2°C per hour” or confuse “4:00 in the evening” with 4:00 am.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Requires multi-step reasoning: find time difference (6 hours), then multiply 2 × 6, then add to 30. Struggling students often miss one step, especially calculating elapsed time correctly.  
- **Specificity:** Answer must be numeric (°C); small arithmetic errors cost full marks.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  - Time error: thinking 10 am to 4 pm is 4 or 14 hours.  
  - Adding 2°C only for each whole hour but miscounting.  
  - Forgetting to add initial 30°C after multiplying.  
- **Group estimates:**  
  - **Struggling:** Only about 10% will get all steps right; many get lost in reasoning.  
  - **Basic:** Around 40% can manage with careful steps, but errors in time or multiplication common.  
  - **Competent:** Most (80%) understand and execute correctly; occasional slips.  
  - **Advanced:** Nearly all (95%) solve accurately; rare careless mistakes.
