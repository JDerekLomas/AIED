**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** often cannot identify the subject ("He") or the verb ("is reading") due to very limited vocabulary and sentence structure awareness in English. Many will jumble the words randomly or write "book is he a reading".  
- **Basic level students** have some familiarity with common words and the "subject + is + verb-ing + object" pattern from classroom drills, but may still confuse word order, especially placing "a" incorrectly (e.g., "He is a reading book"). About 40% will get it correct with focus.  
- **Competent students** understand basic sentence structure and can apply the pattern; a few might still miss the article "a" or misplace it, but most will arrange it correctly.  
- **Advanced students** will find this straightforward and almost all will score full marks.  

The task requires reasoning with known grammar patterns rather than pure recall, which is harder for Hindi-medium students due to differing sentence structures (SOV in Hindi vs. SVO in English). The specificity of the answer ("He is reading a book") leaves little room for variation, so errors are common among those not yet internalized English syntax.
