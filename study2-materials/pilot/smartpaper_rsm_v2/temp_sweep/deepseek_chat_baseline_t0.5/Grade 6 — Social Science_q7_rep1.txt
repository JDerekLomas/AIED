**Reasoning:**  
The question has two clear parts: recall two resources and explain one’s influence.  
- **Language barrier:** The English phrasing may hinder struggling and basic learners, even if they know the content.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Naming two resources is pure recall from the textbook, but explaining influence requires connecting facts to daily life—a challenge for many.  
- **Specificity:** Students often list incorrect or vague resources (e.g., “soil” instead of specific minerals) or give overly general explanations.  
- **Common mistakes:** Mixing up resources from other states, writing “water” without context, or explaining influence in one vague line (“it gives jobs”) without clear linkage.  

Advanced students handle both parts accurately. Competent students usually recall correctly but may give weaker explanations. Basic students often get one resource right but struggle to explain. Struggling students frequently miss the question’s demand due to language and conceptual gaps.
