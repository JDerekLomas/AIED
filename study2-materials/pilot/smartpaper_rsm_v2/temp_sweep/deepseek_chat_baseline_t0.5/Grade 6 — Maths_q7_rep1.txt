struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The problem is short and numbers are clear, but some struggling students may not fully grasp “temperature increases by 2°C per hour” or confuse “4:00 in the evening” with 4:00 am.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Requires multi-step reasoning: find time difference (6 hours), then multiply 2 × 6, then add to 30. Struggling students often miss one step, especially calculating elapsed time correctly.  
- **Specificity:** Answer must be numeric (°C); small arithmetic errors can still lead to 0 marks if rubric is strict.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  - Time error: thinking 10 am to 4 pm is 4 or 5 hours.  
  - Adding 2°C only for each whole hour but forgetting initial 30°C.  
  - Misreading “4:00 in the evening” as 4:00 am (leading to 18 hours).  
- **Group insights:**  
  - **Struggling:** Only about 10% will get all steps right; many get stuck on time calculation.  
  - **Basic:** Around 40% can manage with some hesitation; they understand the steps but may make calculation errors.  
  - **Competent:** 80% likely succeed; they follow the procedure reliably.  
  - **Advanced:** Nearly all (95%) get it correct; occasional careless error possible.
