**Reasoning:**  
The question requires direct recall of a specific detail ("magical fairy") from a text. For struggling students, even if the story was read aloud, retaining and reproducing the exact English phrase is a major hurdle due to language barriers and possible memory gaps. Many might leave it blank or write an unclear word. Basic-level students might recall a "fairy" but often miss the adjective "magical" or spell it incorrectly, though the rubric accepts 'fairy', so a portion will get it right. Competent students are likely to recall and write the key term accurately. Advanced students will almost all answer correctly, with only occasional slips in spelling or unnecessary extra details. The main challenge is not reasoning but accessing vocabulary from memory and writing it legibly in English.
