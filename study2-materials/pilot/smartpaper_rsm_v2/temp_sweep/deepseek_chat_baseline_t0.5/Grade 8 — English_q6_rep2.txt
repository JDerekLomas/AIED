**Reasoning:**  
The item requires a precise, textbook-style definition. While "fable" is a known concept, the rubric demands recall of specific elements (short story, animals as characters, moral lesson).  

- **Struggling students** (5%): Severe language barriers and difficulty retaining formal definitions. They may recall it's a story with animals but often miss the "moral lesson" part or cannot articulate it in English.  
- **Basic students** (40%): Can grasp the core idea but may give incomplete answers (e.g., "story with animals" without mentioning the moral, or confusing it with other story types). Language limits accuracy.  
- **Competent students** (85%): Understand and recall the definition well. Some may lose marks for minor omissions (e.g., forgetting "short") or phrasing issues.  
- **Advanced students** (95%): Near-perfect recall; occasional marks lost only due to overly casual wording or adding extra, unnecessary details.
