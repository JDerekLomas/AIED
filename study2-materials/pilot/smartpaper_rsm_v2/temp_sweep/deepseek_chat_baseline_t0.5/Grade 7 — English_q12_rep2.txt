struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 30% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** often cannot identify the subject, object, and verb correctly due to limited vocabulary and grammar awareness. Many would leave it blank or write a Hindi-influenced structure.  
- **Basic level students** might attempt it but commonly make mistakes in tense (using "are blown" instead of "were blown") or omitting "by the wind." About 30% could recall the pattern if taught recently.  
- **Competent students** generally understand the concept but may occasionally miss the past tense form or preposition. Most can apply the rule correctly.  
- **Advanced students** would handle this easily, though rare slips in article/preposition usage might occur.
