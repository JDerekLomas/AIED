advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This is a direct recall question from a story, but success depends heavily on the student's ability to read and comprehend the English text. The **struggling** group, with very limited reading skills, would largely be unable to access the question or the story text. The **basic** group might recall the story if taught recently with strong oral repetition, but many would miss the specific phrase "magical fairy" or might write "a fairy" and still score. The **competent** group can read and locate answers directly from the text, so most would get it correct. The **advanced** group would have no difficulty. Common mistakes for lower groups include leaving it blank, writing incorrect words from the book (e.g., "a girl"), or copying a wrong line from the text due to decoding issues.
