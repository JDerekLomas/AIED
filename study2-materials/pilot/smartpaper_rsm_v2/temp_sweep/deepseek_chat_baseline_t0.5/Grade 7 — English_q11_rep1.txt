**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily isolate individual words by function in an English sentence. They may confuse "adjective" with "word describing the bird" or pick the whole noun phrase "A tiny bird."  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires recalling the definition of an adjective (a describing word) and applying it to identify the specific word "tiny." Struggling students often fail at the recall step; basic students may recall but misapply.  
- **Specificity:** The answer must be exactly "tiny," not "tiny bird." Common mistakes include choosing "in our balcony" (as it tells where) or "bird" (thinking it is the subject being described).  
- **Common mistakes:** Hindi-medium students often equate adjectives with "visheshan" but may identify the wrong word due to weak vocabulary ("tiny" might be unfamiliar) or sentence structure confusion.
