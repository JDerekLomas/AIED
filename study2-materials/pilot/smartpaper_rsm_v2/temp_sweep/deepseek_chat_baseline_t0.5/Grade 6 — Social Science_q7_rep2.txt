struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question has two clear parts: recall two resources and explain one’s influence.  
- **Language barrier:** The question is in English, so struggling and basic students may misread or not understand “influences the lives,” leading to incomplete answers.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Listing resources is pure recall from the textbook, but explaining influence requires connecting facts to daily life—a challenge for many.  
- **Specificity:** Students often list vague resources (e.g., “stones” instead of “sandstone/marble”) or give generic explanations (“water is useful”) without specific Rajasthan context.  
- **Common mistakes:** Mixing up natural resources with manufactured goods, copying incomplete points from notes, or writing only names without explanation.  

Advanced students handle both parts accurately. Competent students usually recall correctly but may give weaker explanations. Basic students often get one resource right but miss the explanation depth. Struggling students frequently leave blanks or write irrelevant points due to language and conceptual gaps.
