struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for Hindi-medium students. While the content (rural occupations of Rajasthan) is familiar from the textbook and lived experience, the phrasing may not be understood by struggling learners. It requires **recall of specific terms** (like "animal husbandry" or "handicrafts") as per the textbook, but students often describe in their own words (e.g., "keeping goats and cows" instead of "animal husbandry"), which may not be awarded full marks if the evaluation is strict. Many in the struggling group might leave it blank or write incomplete answers due to language anxiety. Basic-level students, with some understanding, might recall one occupation correctly but miss the second or describe it informally. Competent and advanced students can navigate the English and recall the required terms, though some competent students may still mix up spellings or descriptions.
