basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily isolate individual words for grammatical function, especially when the adjective ("tiny") is simple and might be overlooked.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires recalling the definition of an adjective (describing word) and applying it to identify a single word, not a phrase. However, the question says "adjective phrase," which may confuse students expecting a group of words.  
- **Specificity:** The answer is very specific ("tiny"). Common mistakes include choosing "tiny bird" (noun phrase) or "in our balcony" (prepositional phrase), especially among basic and struggling learners.  
- **Common mistakes:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with parts of speech terminology in English. Many might not attempt or might circle the whole subject ("A tiny bird"). The competent and advanced groups are more familiar with such metalanguage.
