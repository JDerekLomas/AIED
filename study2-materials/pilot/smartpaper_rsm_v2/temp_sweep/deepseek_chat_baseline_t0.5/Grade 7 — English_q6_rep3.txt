**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive adjective. Many struggling students have very limited vocabulary and may not comprehend the question itself. Basic-level students might understand the question but often provide vague or incorrect words (e.g., "good," "nice") instead of specific style descriptors. Competent students can usually identify a relevant word if taught explicitly, but may still confuse similar terms. Advanced students, with stronger comprehension and vocabulary, are likely to recall or reason appropriately. The 1-mark format makes it accessible, but language barriers and the need for precise vocabulary significantly impact the lower groups.
