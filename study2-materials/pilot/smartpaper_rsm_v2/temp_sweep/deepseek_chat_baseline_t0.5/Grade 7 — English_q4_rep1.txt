**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: recalling the three questions from the text (which is challenging for those with language/reading barriers) and then applying simple reasoning to give *any* valid real-life reason. Many struggling students will fail at the recall step or will not be able to articulate a reason in English. Basic-level students may recall the questions but often give overly vague or incomplete answers. Competent students can generally manage both recall and a simple reason. Advanced students will handle it confidently. The rubric is generous ("any valid reason"), which helps, but language comprehension remains the primary hurdle.
