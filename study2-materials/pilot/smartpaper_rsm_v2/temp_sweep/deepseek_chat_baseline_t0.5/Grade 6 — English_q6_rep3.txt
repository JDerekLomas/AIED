**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both **recall** (identifying a line) and **simple reasoning** (explaining why). Many struggling students, due to language barriers and difficulty in reading the poem itself, may not recall a line accurately or may write an incomplete/incorrect reason. Basic-level students can often recall a line but struggle to articulate a clear "why" in English, often giving vague or copied reasons. Competent students are more likely to manage both parts, though some may lose marks for unclear justification. Advanced students typically handle it well, with only occasional slips in specificity. A common mistake across levels is writing an interpretation or summary instead of a personal reason, or not quoting the line exactly.
