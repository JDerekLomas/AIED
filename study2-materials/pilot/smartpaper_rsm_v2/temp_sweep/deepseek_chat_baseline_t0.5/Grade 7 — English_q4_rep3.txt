**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: recalling the three questions from the text (which are explicitly stated) and then applying simple reasoning to connect one of them to "real life." The main barrier is language comprehension—many struggling and basic students may not fully understand the phrasing "important in real life" or may fail to extract the specific questions from the passage despite having read it. Common mistakes include leaving the answer blank, copying irrelevant lines from the text, or giving a reason unrelated to the king's questions (e.g., "yes, because kings are important"). Competent and advanced students, who can decode the English and follow the instruction, are likely to succeed, though some competent students may still offer overly vague reasons.
