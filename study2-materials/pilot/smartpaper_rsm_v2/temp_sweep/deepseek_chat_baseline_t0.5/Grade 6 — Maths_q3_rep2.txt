struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is numeric, so language is less of an issue here. However, some struggling students may not understand “ascending order” even if demonstrated before, due to weak recall of English terms.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires understanding place value (comparing thousands, hundreds) and ordering logic, not just recall. Struggling students often compare only first digits incorrectly when numbers have different digits (e.g., thinking 736 is larger than 3367 because 7 > 3).  
- **Specificity:** The rubric only requires identifying smallest number first for full marks, so partial ordering errors after that still get credit. This helps basic-level students who might order the first two correctly but slip later.  
- **Common mistakes:** Misreading numbers, comparing digits left-to-right without considering number length, and writing in descending instead of ascending order.  
- **Experience estimate:** Many basic-level students can handle this with prior practice; struggling students often guess or confuse order; competent and advanced students typically get it right.
