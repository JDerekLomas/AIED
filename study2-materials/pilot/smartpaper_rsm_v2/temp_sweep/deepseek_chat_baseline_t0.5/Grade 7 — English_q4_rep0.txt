**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: **recall** (of the three questions from the passage) and **reasoning** (to connect one to real-life importance). The main barrier is language comprehension of the question itself. Many struggling students, due to limited English proficiency, may not fully understand what "important in real life" means in this context, or may fail to recall the exact questions from the text. Basic-level students can often recall but struggle to articulate a valid reason clearly. Competent students handle both recall and simple reasoning well. Advanced students grasp the conceptual link easily. A common mistake is to narrate the story instead of giving a reason, or to misinterpret the question as asking *what* the king's questions were, not *if* they are important.
