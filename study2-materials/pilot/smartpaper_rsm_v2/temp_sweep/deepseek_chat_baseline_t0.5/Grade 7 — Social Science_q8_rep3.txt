struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for many Hindi-medium students. While the content (rural occupations of Rajasthan) is familiar from their textbook and surroundings, the phrasing may not be fully understood. The task requires **recall** of specific terms taught in class (like agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts).  

- **Struggling students (35%):** Most would not comprehend the English question fully. Even if they know the answer in Hindi, they may not recall or recognize the correct English terms. Some might write vague or incorrect answers.  
- **Basic students (35%):** About 40% would manage because they can grasp key words like "occupations" and "Rajasthan," and have basic recall of terms from rote learning, though spelling/expression may be weak.  
- **Competent students (20%):** A high percentage would score full marks as they understand the English question, have good recall, and can match concepts to terms.  
- **Advanced students (10%):** Nearly all would answer correctly, as they comfortably handle both language and content.  

Common mistakes: Mixing up "occupations" with "cultures" or festivals, listing only one occupation, or writing in Hindi when the rubric expects English terms.
