**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: **recalling** the three questions from the text (which are explicitly stated) and then applying **simple reasoning** to give *any* valid real-life reason why such questions are important. The main barrier is **language comprehension** of the question itself. Many struggling students would not fully understand "important in real life" or fail to connect the recalled facts to a reason. Basic-level students, with some understanding, might recall the questions but often give overly vague or incomplete reasons. Competent students can typically manage both recall and a straightforward reason (e.g., "to be successful"). Advanced students handle this easily. Common mistakes include copying a line from the passage without giving a reason, or answering "yes/no" without justification.
