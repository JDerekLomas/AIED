struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, so even with limited English, students can identify it as a simple algebra problem. However, struggling students may be intimidated by the English letters and symbols.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires basic reasoning (inverse operation: subtract 9 from both sides) rather than rote recall. Struggling students often fail to transfer addition-subtraction logic to equations with letters.  
- **Specificity of answer:** Only `y = -5` is correct. Common mistakes include writing `y = 13` (adding 9 and 4), `y = 5` (ignoring the negative), or leaving it blank due to confusion with negative numbers.  
- **Context:** Many students in the struggling group have weak foundational arithmetic and limited exposure to negative numbers, reducing success rates. Basic-level students can often solve it but may make sign errors. Competent and advanced students handle it confidently.
