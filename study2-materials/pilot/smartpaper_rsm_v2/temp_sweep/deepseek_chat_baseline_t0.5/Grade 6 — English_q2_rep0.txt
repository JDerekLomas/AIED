**Reasoning:**  
The question requires direct recall of a specific detail ("magical fairy") from a text. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the main barriers are vocabulary (understanding "magical fairy") and the ability to locate/retain this detail from English text.  

- **Struggling (35%):** Most will not recall the exact phrase. Common mistakes include not attempting, writing "a girl/boy," or copying a random line from the text. Only a few with better recall might get it.  
- **Basic (35%):** Many can recall a character lived in the book, but may answer "a fairy" (accepted) or incorrectly specify "a princess" or "genie." Around 40% likely recall the correct term.  
- **Competent (20%):** Strong recall and reading comprehension. Most will answer correctly, though some may overcomplicate or paraphrase loosely.  
- **Advanced (10%):** Near-perfect recall and understanding. A small margin may lose marks only if they give an overly elaborate answer not matching the rubric exactly.
