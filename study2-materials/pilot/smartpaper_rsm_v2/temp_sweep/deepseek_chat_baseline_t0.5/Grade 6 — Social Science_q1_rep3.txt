competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is pure recall from geography, but the English phrasing ("mountain ranges located in India") can be a barrier. Many struggling students might know local or Hindi names (e.g., "Himalaya") but may not write it correctly in English or may confuse "range" with a specific peak. Basic-level students often recall the Himalayas but may struggle to name a second range confidently. Competent students usually know at least two major ranges. Advanced students are very likely to answer correctly, though occasional spelling errors ("Aravali" vs "Aravalli") might occur. The rubric is generous, accepting multiple correct names, which helps.
