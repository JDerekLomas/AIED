**Reasoning:**  
This item tests the basic grammar rule of using "some" in affirmative statements and "any" in questions or negatives. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the concept of countable/uncountable nouns with "some/any" is often unfamiliar and directly interferes with Hindi structures.  

- **Struggling students** (35%) have very limited reading comprehension and vocabulary; they often guess or confuse similar-sounding words. Many might choose "any" because it's more commonly heard in questions ("Are there any apples?").  
- **Basic students** (35%) can read the sentence but may not internalize the rule; they might apply rote memory if taught recently, but in an isolated question, only about 40% would recall correctly.  
- **Competent students** (20%) understand the pattern and can apply it in simple sentences, though occasional slips happen.  
- **Advanced students** (10%) would almost always get this correct, with rare errors due to overthinking or haste.  

The specificity of the answer ("some" is the only correct option) makes it challenging for those who haven’t mastered the rule, as it requires recall rather than contextual reasoning. Common mistakes include choosing "any" due to L1 interference or lack of exposure to affirmative sentence patterns in English.
