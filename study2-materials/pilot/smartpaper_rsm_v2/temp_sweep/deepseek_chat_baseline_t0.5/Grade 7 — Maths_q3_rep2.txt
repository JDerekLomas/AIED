**Reasoning:**  
- The formula is directly recalled from the chapter on perimeter and area, which is familiar.  
- Language barrier is minimal here because the item uses numbers and simple terms ("base," "height," "area," "triangle") that are frequently used in class in both English and Hindi.  
- Struggling students often forget the formula or apply `base × height` without halving it, or confuse it with the perimeter formula. Many also struggle to write the formula clearly even if they know it.  
- Basic-level students usually remember the formula but may make calculation errors; however, since `1/2 × 8 × 6` is simple, most get it right.  
- Competent and advanced students reliably recall and apply the formula correctly.
