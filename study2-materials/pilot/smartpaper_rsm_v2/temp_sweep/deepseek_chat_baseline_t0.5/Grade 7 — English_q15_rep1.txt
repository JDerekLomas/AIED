struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
The task requires constructing a coherent paragraph with three specific details. For the **struggling** group, forming complete English sentences is a major hurdle; most will produce fragmented or copied text. The **basic** group can often list points but may struggle with sequencing, correct tense ("when you do it"), or the "why" part, reducing full-mark success. The **competent** group typically manages all elements, though with minor grammatical errors that may not always impact clarity for scoring. The **advanced** group will consistently meet all rubric criteria. The main barriers are sentence formation, vocabulary for "why," and understanding "when" as a habitual time (e.g., "on Sundays") rather than just "in my free time," which is often insufficiently specific.
