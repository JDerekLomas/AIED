**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both **recall** (identifying a line) and **simple reasoning** (explaining why). Many struggling students, due to language barriers and difficulty reading the poem itself, may not recall a line accurately or may give a reason that is too vague (e.g., "It is nice") without meeting the rubric's requirement of "mentions why." Basic-level students can often recall a line but struggle to articulate a clear, relevant reason in English. Competent students are more likely to manage both tasks adequately. Advanced students typically succeed unless they overcomplicate or misinterpret the rubric. Common mistakes include copying a line incorrectly, giving a reason unrelated to the line, or writing the reason in Hindi without English translation.
