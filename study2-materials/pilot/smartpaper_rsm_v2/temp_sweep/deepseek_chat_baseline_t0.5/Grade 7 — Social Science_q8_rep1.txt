struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for many Hindi-medium students. While the content (rural occupations of Rajasthan) is familiar from the textbook and local context, the phrasing may not be fully understood by struggling learners. It requires **recall** of specific terms taught in class (like "animal husbandry" or "handicrafts"), not just general knowledge.  

Common mistakes include:  
- Not understanding "occupations" and leaving the answer blank.  
- Writing only one occupation instead of two.  
- Using vague or local terms (e.g., "keeping goats" instead of "animal husbandry") which might not be accepted if the examiner expects textbook terminology.  

The **competent** and **advanced** groups are more likely to recall and match the English terms correctly. The **basic** group might manage if they recognize keywords, while the **struggling** group will largely be hindered by language and recall gaps.
