struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. While the topic is covered in the curriculum, the **specificity** of the required answer ("one key feature") means students must recall and reproduce a precise term (e.g., "drainage system," "grid layout," "citadel and lower town").  

- **Struggling students (10%):** Most will find it hard to understand the English phrasing. Even if they know the content in Hindi, translating it accurately into English for writing is a major hurdle. Common mistakes include vague answers ("they had good cities") or mixing up facts with other chapters.  
- **Basic students (40%):** They likely understand the core concept when taught in a mixed medium (Hindi + English). With recall practice, a significant portion can write one correct feature, but may spell it incorrectly ("drainage," "citadel") or describe it incompletely.  
- **Competent students (80%):** They can navigate the English question and have good recall. Most will score full marks, though some may lose marks if they describe a feature too generally without using the standard key terms.  
- **Advanced students (95%):** Near-perfect recall and ability to express it in simple English. The rare error might be from overcomplicating the answer or writing more than one feature unclearly.
