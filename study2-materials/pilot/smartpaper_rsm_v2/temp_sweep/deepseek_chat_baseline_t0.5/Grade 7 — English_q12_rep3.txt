**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling group:** Most cannot identify subject/verb/object in English. Converting tense (blew → were blown) and adding "by" is highly challenging. Common mistakes include writing "The leaves is blown" or copying the sentence as is.  
- **Basic group:** Some can identify "leaves" as object to move to front, but tense change and preposition "by" are often missed (e.g., "The leaves blown away wind"). Around 30% may recall the structure with guidance.  
- **Competent group:** Understands the concept, can apply past tense passive ("were blown") and include "by the wind," though occasional article errors ("by wind") may occur. High success rate.  
- **Advanced group:** Near-perfect accuracy; rare errors might be spelling or unnecessary overcomplication.
