**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily isolate individual words for grammatical function, especially if they are still decoding the sentence.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires knowing the definition of an "adjective" (recall) and applying it to find which word describes the noun (reasoning). Struggling students often lack the recalled concept.  
- **Specificity:** The answer must be the single word "tiny"; a common mistake is choosing "tiny bird" (noun phrase) or "in our balcony" (prepositional phrase).  
- **Common mistakes:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may confuse adjectives with other describing elements or pick the wrong word because they focus on meaning rather than grammar. The competent and advanced groups are more familiar with such metalanguage and can apply it correctly.
