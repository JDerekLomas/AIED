**Reasoning:**  
The question requires a precise, textbook definition. While "moral lesson" is commonly recalled, the specific mention of "animals as characters" is often missed, especially by students with limited English proficiency. Struggling students may only recall "story with a lesson" or confuse it with other genres. Basic-level students might recall one part correctly but not both. Competent and advanced students are more likely to reproduce the full definition, though some may still phrase it imperfectly. The language of the question ("Define fable") itself can be a barrier for those who cannot decode the word "define" easily.
