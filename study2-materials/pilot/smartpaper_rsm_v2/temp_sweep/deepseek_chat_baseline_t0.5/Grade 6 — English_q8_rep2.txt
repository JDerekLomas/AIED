**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** often cannot identify the subject ("He") or the verb ("is reading") due to very limited vocabulary and confusion with Hindi sentence structure (S-O-V). Many would write "He a book reading is" or similar.  
- **Basic level students** might recognize "He" as the starting word but often mix up the article 'a' or place "reading" incorrectly. With coaching, some get it right.  
- **Competent students** generally understand subject-verb-object order in simple sentences and can arrange it correctly, though some may still miss the article placement.  
- **Advanced students** find this straightforward as they have internalized basic English syntax through exposure and practice.
