**Reasoning:**  
This question requires not just recall of "composting," but reasoning about change (decomposition, smell, volume reduction) and linking it to soil health benefits. The language barrier is significant—many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds would struggle to comprehend "evaluate if this is beneficial" even if they know the concept. Struggling students often miss the "reasons" part or give incomplete answers. Basic-level students might recall that the waste rots but may not clearly connect it to soil health. Competent students can reason through the process but may lose marks on language expression. Advanced students grasp both the process and the benefit clearly, and can articulate it sufficiently for full marks.
