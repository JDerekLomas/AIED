competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This question tests **recall** of a specific, well-known fact from the textbook. However, the **language barrier** is significant. Many struggling and basic-level students, even if they know the concept in Hindi, may not recall the precise English terms (e.g., "grid layout," "drainage system," "citadel") or may spell them incorrectly. The **specificity** required by the rubric means answers like "good planning" or "clean cities" would not score. Common mistakes include mixing up features (e.g., writing about seals instead of planning) or giving vague, incomplete descriptions. Competent and advanced students, who are more familiar with textbook language and key terms, are far more likely to produce a scorable answer.
