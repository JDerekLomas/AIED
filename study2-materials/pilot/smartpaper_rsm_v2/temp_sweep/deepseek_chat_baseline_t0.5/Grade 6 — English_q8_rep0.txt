**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** often cannot identify the subject ("He") or the verb ("is reading") due to limited vocabulary and unfamiliarity with English sentence structure. Many will jumble the words or write them in the given order.  
- **Basic level students** may recognize common words like "book" and "reading" but might struggle with the auxiliary verb "is" and correct word order (e.g., "He reading a book is"). With effort, some can arrive at the correct sequence.  
- **Competent students** understand basic Subject-Verb-Object patterns and can rearrange the words correctly, though occasional slips with articles ("a") may occur.  
- **Advanced students** find this straightforward and consistently apply grammatical rules to form the sentence correctly.  

The task requires **reasoning with known grammar rules**, not just recall. The specificity of the answer ("He is reading a book") is high, leaving little room for variation, which increases difficulty for learners with Hindi-medium backgrounds where sentence structure differs. Common mistakes include omitting "is", placing "a" incorrectly, or writing "Reading a book he is" due to L1 interference.
