struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The instruction is short and numbers are universal, so language impact is minimal here. However, some struggling students may not understand "ascending order" even if demonstrated before.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires comparing place values (number of digits first, then thousands/hundreds place comparison), which is reasoning-based but practiced often.  
- **Specificity:** Only the smallest number needs to be identified correctly for full marks, making it easier.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  - Comparing only the first digit incorrectly (e.g., thinking 3367 > 4799 because 3 > 4 in first digit confusion).  
  - Ignoring number of digits (736 has 3 digits, others have 4) — this is the key hurdle for struggling students.  
  - Misreading digits due to lack of practice with larger numbers.  

Struggling students often miss the digit-length rule; basic students sometimes compare incorrectly beyond the first digit. Competent and advanced students generally handle this well.
