**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding of decomposition and composting, which is part of the Class 8 Science syllabus (Chapter: Microorganisms). However, many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds struggle with the English phrasing of "notice any change," "give reasons," and "evaluate."  

- **Struggling students** often miss key terms or cannot express the process in English. They might only write "yes" without reasons.  
- **Basic level students** may recall that the waste rots or becomes manure but often fail to clearly link it to microorganisms or soil health benefits.  
- **Competent students** can explain decomposition and soil enrichment, though language may limit clarity.  
- **Advanced students** comfortably explain in simple English, mentioning decay, humus, and improved soil fertility.  

Common mistakes include: confusing composting with burning, not specifying biological processes, or writing vague answers like "it becomes soil." The scoring rubric’s requirement for "significant changes" and reasoning makes it challenging for struggling and basic learners.
