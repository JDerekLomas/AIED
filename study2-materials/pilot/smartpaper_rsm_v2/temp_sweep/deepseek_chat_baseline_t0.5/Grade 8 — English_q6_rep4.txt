**Reasoning:**  
The item requires recall of a specific definition with two key components: "short story with animal characters" and "moral lesson." Language is a major barrier. Struggling students often miss key terms or confuse fables with other stories. Basic-level students might recall one part (e.g., "story with animals") but omit the moral lesson. Competent students usually grasp both parts, though phrasing may vary. Advanced students consistently provide accurate definitions. Common mistakes include mixing up fables with parables or fairy tales, or failing to mention the moral explicitly.
