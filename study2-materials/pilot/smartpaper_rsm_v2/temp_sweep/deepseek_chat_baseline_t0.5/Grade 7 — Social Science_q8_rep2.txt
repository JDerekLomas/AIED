advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for Hindi-medium students. While the content (rural Rajasthan occupations) is familiar from daily life and textbook examples in Hindi, the student must first comprehend the question and then recall/translate terms like "agriculture" or "animal husbandry" into acceptable English answers.  

- **Struggling students (10%)**: Most would know the occupations in their local language but struggle to read/understand the English question or write the correct English terms. A few might manage with words like "farming" or "crafts."  
- **Basic students (40%)**: With some English comprehension, they can often identify two occupations but may spell incorrectly (e.g., "agriculcher," "husbandary") or give vague answers. Some might list only one correctly.  
- **Competent students (80%)**: They understand the question well and can recall textbook terms, though minor errors in description may occur.  
- **Advanced students (95%)**: They handle the language and content confidently; the rare error might be due to oversight, not lack of knowledge.  

Common mistakes include writing occupations in Hindi/transliterated Hindi, mixing up "occupations" with "caste-based work," or describing only one occupation when two are required.
