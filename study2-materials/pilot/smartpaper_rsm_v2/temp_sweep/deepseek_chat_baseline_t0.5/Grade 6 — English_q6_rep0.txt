**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both **recall** (denoting a line) and **simple reasoning** (explaining why). Many struggling students, due to language barriers and difficulty in reading the poem itself, may not recall a line accurately or may copy incorrectly. The "why" part often gets skipped or is too vague (e.g., "because it is nice"). Basic-level students can often quote a line but struggle to articulate a clear, relevant reason. Competent students typically manage both parts adequately, though their explanations may be brief. Advanced students usually handle it well. Common mistakes include misquoting, giving a reason unrelated to the poem's content, or writing in fragmented Hindi-influenced English.
