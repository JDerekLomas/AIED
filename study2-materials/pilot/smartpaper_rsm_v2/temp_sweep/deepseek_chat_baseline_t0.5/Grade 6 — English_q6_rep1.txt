**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both **recall** (identifying a line) and **simple reasoning** (explaining why). Many struggling students, due to language barriers and difficulty in reading the poem itself, may not recall a line accurately or may give a reason that is too vague (e.g., "It is nice") without meeting the rubric's requirement for "mentions why." Basic-level students can often recall a line but struggle to articulate a clear, relevant reason in English. Competent students are more likely to manage both parts adequately, though some may lose marks for incomplete justification. Advanced students typically handle this well, but a few may overcomplicate or give reasons not directly linked to the line.
