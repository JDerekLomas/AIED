struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
- **Language barriers:** The problem is short and numbers are clear, but some struggling students may not fully grasp “temperature increases by 2°C per hour” or confuse “4:00 in the evening” with 4:00 am.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires simple reasoning (time difference calculation) and applying multiplication (6 × 2) and addition (30 + 12). Struggling students often miss the time duration step.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric only awards full marks for correct time calculation and final answer; partial credit is not considered here.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  1. Taking time difference as 4 hours (10 to 4) without considering it’s pm.  
  2. Directly adding 2°C without calculating hours.  
  3. Misreading “4:00 in the evening” as 4:00 am (leading to 18 hours difference).  
  4. Arithmetic errors in multiplication or addition.  

Given these factors, even many “basic” students may get the time difference wrong, while competent and advanced students are likely to follow the steps correctly.
