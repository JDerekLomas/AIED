struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The problem is short and numbers are clear, but “temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour” may confuse some Hindi-medium students if not explained verbally. Struggling students often miss such key phrases.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Requires two steps: calculating 6 hours elapsed and multiplying 2°C/hour × 6, then adding to 30°C. Struggling students often fail at step 1 (time calculation from am to pm) or lose track in step 2.  
- **Specificity:** Answer must be exact (42°C). Common mistakes include:  
  - Misreading 4:00 pm as 4 hours later (answer 38°C).  
  - Forgetting to add initial temperature.  
  - Arithmetic errors in multiplication/addition.  
- **Experience:** Competent and advanced students handle multi-step word problems well. Basic students get confused with time duration but can succeed if guided. Struggling students often guess or leave blank.
