**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily isolate individual words for grammatical function, especially if they are still decoding the sentence.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires knowing the definition of an "adjective" (recall) and applying it to find which word describes the noun (reasoning). Struggling students often confuse adjectives with nouns or verbs.  
- **Specificity:** The answer must be the single word "tiny." Common mistakes include choosing "tiny bird" (noun phrase) or "in our balcony" (prepositional phrase).  
- **Common mistakes:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds might translate and identify "bird" or "nest" as the describing word, or pick the entire phrase "A tiny bird" thinking "adjective phrase" means "the phrase with the adjective in it." Advanced students rarely make this error.
