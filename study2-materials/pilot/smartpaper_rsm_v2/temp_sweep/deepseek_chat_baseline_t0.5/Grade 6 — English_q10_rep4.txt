**Reasoning:**  
This item tests the basic grammar rule of using "some" in affirmative sentences and "any" in questions/negatives. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, this is not intuitive. Many struggle with reading the sentence correctly and often guess based on familiar sound ("any" is more commonly heard in questions they encounter). The "some/any" distinction requires recall of a specific rule, not just reasoning from context.  

- **Struggling students** often confuse the two words or pick "any" because it appears more frequently in their limited exposure ("Are there any...?").  
- **Basic level** students have a fair chance if they recall the rule, but inconsistency in application leads to mistakes.  
- **Competent students** mostly know the rule but may slip due to lack of practice.  
- **Advanced students** are very likely to get it correct, though occasional overthinking or influence of spoken English errors might cause a rare mistake.
