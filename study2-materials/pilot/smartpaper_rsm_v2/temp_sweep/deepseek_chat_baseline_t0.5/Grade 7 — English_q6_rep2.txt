**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive word (e.g., simple, descriptive). For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, this is challenging because:  
1. **Language barrier:** Many struggling students cannot comprehend the question itself.  
2. **Vocabulary gap:** Words like "style," "descriptive," or "informal" may not be in their active vocabulary.  
3. **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is not direct recall from text; it requires interpretation of the poet's language, which needs a higher level of comprehension.  
4. **Common mistakes:** Students often copy lines from the poem instead of identifying style, or leave it blank.  

The **struggling** group largely lacks the vocabulary and confidence to attempt such analytical questions. The **basic** group might manage if the style was explicitly discussed in class with examples. The **competent** group can often infer correctly if taught the concept with scaffolding. The **advanced** group typically grasps and applies such literary terms effectively.
