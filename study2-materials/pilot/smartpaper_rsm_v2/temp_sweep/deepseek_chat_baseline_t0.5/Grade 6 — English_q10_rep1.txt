**Reasoning:**  
This item tests the basic grammar rule of using "some" in affirmative statements and "any" in questions/negatives. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, this is a memorized rule, not intuitive.  

- **Struggling students** often cannot read the sentence fluently and may guess randomly or pick the more familiar word "any" from common question patterns ("Are there any...?").  
- **Basic level students** might recognize the sentence structure but still confuse the rule under exam pressure; around half may get it correct.  
- **Competent students** are likely to have internalized this rule through practice and will mostly select "some" correctly.  
- **Advanced students** will almost certainly know this, with rare errors due to overthinking or carelessness.  

The main barrier is that this requires recall of an explicit English grammar rule, not just comprehension of meaning. Many struggling learners lack this memorized knowledge.
