**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** often cannot identify the subject ("He") or the verb ("is reading") due to very limited vocabulary and confusion with word order from Hindi (S-O-V). Many would jumble the sequence or write "book a reading is he".  
- **Basic level students** might recognize "He" and "book" but struggle with the correct placement of the article "a" and the verb phrase "is reading". About 40% could arrive at the correct order through trial and error or basic familiarity.  
- **Competent students** understand subject-verb-object structure in simple sentences. Most would get it right, though some might still place "a" incorrectly (e.g., "He is reading book a") due to L1 interference.  
- **Advanced students** have internalized basic English syntax and would almost all arrange it correctly without effort.
