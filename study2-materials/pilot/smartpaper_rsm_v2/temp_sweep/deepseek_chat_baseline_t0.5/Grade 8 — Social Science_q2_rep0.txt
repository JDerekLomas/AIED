**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. While the topic is taught and likely revised, the *recall* of a specific, precise term (like "grid layout," "drainage system," or "citadel and lower town") in English is challenging.  

- **Struggling (35%):** Most would recall general ideas (e.g., "they had good drains") but may not articulate the exact, textbook "key feature" in English. Many might leave it blank or write incomplete sentences.  
- **Basic (35%):** About half could recall one correct feature, but phrasing may be imperfect. Common mistakes include mixing up features (e.g., "they had buildings") or using vague terms.  
- **Competent (20%):** A strong majority would correctly identify and describe one feature, as they can overcome language barriers for familiar, memorized content.  
- **Advanced (10%):** Nearly all would score full marks, often providing precise terminology and even extra details.
