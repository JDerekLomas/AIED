**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive adjective. Many struggling students have very limited vocabulary and may not comprehend the question itself. Basic-level students might understand the question but often provide vague or incorrect words (e.g., "good," "nice") instead of specific style descriptors. Competent students can reason from the text and use appropriate words like "simple" or "descriptive." Advanced students consistently identify accurate terms. The language barrier and need for precise vocabulary make this challenging for the lower proficiency groups.
