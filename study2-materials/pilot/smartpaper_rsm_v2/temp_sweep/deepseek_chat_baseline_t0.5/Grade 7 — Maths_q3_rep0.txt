struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The question is short and numbers are given, so even with limited English, many students recognize the diagram or context of "base" and "height" from prior practice.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is direct recall and application of a standard formula taught repeatedly. Struggling students may forget the formula or confuse it with perimeter; basic-level students often recall it but may make calculation errors (e.g., forgetting to multiply by 1/2).  
- **Specificity:** The rubric is generous—only the formula needs to be stated or used correctly. Many competent students will apply it directly.  
- **Common mistakes:** Forgetting the `1/2`, using `base × height` directly, or misplacing decimal/division. Struggling students also sometimes add units incorrectly or confuse triangle with rectangle area.
