**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, so even with limited English, many can attempt it if they understand the operation.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires basic understanding of solving linear equations by transposition/subtraction, not just recall. Struggling students often fail to move the number correctly or handle negative answers.  
- **Specificity:** The answer is exact (`y = -5`). Common mistakes include writing `y = 13` (adding 9 and 4), `y = 5` (ignoring the negative), or leaving it incomplete.  
- **Experience:** Many struggling students fear negative numbers. Basic-level students might solve correctly but sometimes make sign errors. Competent and advanced students are comfortable with such one-step equations.
