REASONING: This question requires recall of a specific historical fact from a standard Class 8 syllabus topic, making it more straightforward than interpreting a poem's theme (5%) but slightly more demanding than naming two Fundamental Rights (66%), as it asks for a descriptive feature rather than just a list. It is comparable in difficulty to the archaeological vs. literary sources question (15%), as both test concrete historical knowledge.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
