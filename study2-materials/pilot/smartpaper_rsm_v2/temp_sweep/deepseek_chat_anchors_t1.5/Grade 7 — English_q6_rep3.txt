REASONING: This question requires a more abstract, interpretive understanding of literary style compared to the more concrete factual recall needed for items like naming Fundamental Rights (66%) or listing the king's three questions (50%). It is likely harder than the paragraph writing (30%), as that allowed for personal, generated content, while this demands a specific analytical term. It may be slightly easier than the poem theme question (5%) as "writing style" can sometimes be answered with a common, taught descriptor.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
