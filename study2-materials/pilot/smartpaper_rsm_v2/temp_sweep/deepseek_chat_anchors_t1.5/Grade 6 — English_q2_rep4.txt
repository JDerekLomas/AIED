REASONING: This is a direct, literal recall question from a story with a single, specific answer, making it much easier than thematic interpretation ("The Last Bargain") or conceptual differentiation (archaeological vs. literary sources). It is most similar to the factual recall about the king's three questions (50% pass) but is even simpler, as the answer is a single noun phrase from the text.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
