REASONING: This question requires recall of specific regional knowledge (Rajasthan's rural occupations) and brief description, which is more demanding than naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass) but similar in structure to differentiating source types (15% pass). However, the content is concrete and likely covered in Class 7 Geography, making it somewhat easier than the highly abstract poem theme (5% pass).

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
