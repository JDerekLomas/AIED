REASONING: This question requires a more abstract, literary understanding than the factual recall of the 50% and 66% anchor items, but is more focused and has clearer possible answers than the highly abstract theme question (5% anchor). It is similar in cognitive demand to the "archaeological vs literary sources" item (15% anchor), as both require applying a learned concept (writing style vs. source types) to a specific example.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
