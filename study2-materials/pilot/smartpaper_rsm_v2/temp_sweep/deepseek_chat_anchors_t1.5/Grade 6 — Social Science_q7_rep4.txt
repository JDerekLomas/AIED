REASONING: This item requires recall of specific state-based factual knowledge (natural resources of Rajasthan) and a basic explanation, making it more difficult than naming Fundamental Rights (66% pass) but likely easier than the poem theme (5% pass) or differentiating source types (15% pass). It is comparable to the "three questions" item (50% pass), but the state-specific focus may add slight difficulty.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
