REASONING: This question requires identifying a single word ("tiny") as an adjective, which is a simpler, more concrete task than the thematic interpretation, paragraph writing, or definition required in the lower-pass-rate anchors. It is most similar to the "three questions" item (50% pass), but likely easier as it tests basic grammar recognition rather than recall of a story's details.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
