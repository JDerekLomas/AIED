REASONING: This question requires specific historical knowledge recall and application, similar to the archaeology vs. literary sources item (15% pass rate), but is more focused and concrete, making it somewhat easier than that anchor. It is likely harder than naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate), which is a more common and general civics recall task.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
