REASONING: This item requires identifying a single word ("tiny") as an adjective, which is a simpler and more discrete grammar task than constructing a theme, differentiating concepts with examples, writing a paragraph, or recalling specific story details or constitutional rights. It is most comparable to the easiest anchor (66% pass rate) but is even more straightforward, as it involves basic recognition rather than recall of specific knowledge.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
