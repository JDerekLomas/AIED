REASONING: This question requires both recall of specific facts (two resources) and a basic explanation, making it more demanding than simple recall (like naming Fundamental Rights, 66%) but less complex than explaining a theme (5%) or differentiating concepts (15%). It is most similar to the "three questions" item (50%), which required specific recall from a passage.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
