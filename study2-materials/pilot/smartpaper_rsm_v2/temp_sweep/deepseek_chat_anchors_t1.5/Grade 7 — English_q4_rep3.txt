REASONING: This item requires both comprehension (knowing the three questions) and a simple personal judgment/application ("Give one reason"), which is more complex than the 66% item (recall of two rights) but less complex than the 5% item (abstract theme of a poem). It is most similar to the 50% item, which also tests comprehension of the king's questions, but adds a reasoning step, likely making it slightly harder.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
