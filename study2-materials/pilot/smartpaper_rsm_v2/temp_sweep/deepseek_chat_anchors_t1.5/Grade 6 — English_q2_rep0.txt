REASONING: This is a simple, direct recall question about a specific character from a story, making it far easier than thematic analysis ("The Last Bargain") or differentiation with examples (archaeological/literary sources). It is most similar to the "three questions" item (50% pass), but even simpler, as it requires only a single, concrete name.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
