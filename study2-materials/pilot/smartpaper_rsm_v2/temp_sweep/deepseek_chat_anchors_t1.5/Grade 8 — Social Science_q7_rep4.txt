REASONING: This question requires specific historical cause-and-effect knowledge about a key event, similar in conceptual demand to the "Battle of Plassey" anchor, but it is more straightforward than the literary theme analysis (5% pass rate) and slightly more demanding than recalling Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate). It is comparable to the "three questions" item (50% pass rate) but involves a concrete historical fact rather than recalling details from a provided passage.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
