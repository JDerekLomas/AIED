REASONING: This item requires both recall of a specific line and a simple personal justification, which is more complex than simple naming or listing (like the 66% and 50% items) but less abstract than identifying a central theme (5% item). It is similar in cognitive demand to the "favorite season" paragraph (30% item), which also requires a personal choice and explanation.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
