REASONING: This question requires a precise definition of a literary term, which is more difficult than naming items (like Fundamental Rights, 66%) or extracting explicit facts from a text (like the three questions, 50%), but less difficult than constructing a thematic analysis (like the poem theme, 5%) or a comparative explanation (like archaeological vs. literary sources, 15%). It is closest in difficulty to the paragraph writing (30%), but defining a single term is more constrained and recall-based.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
