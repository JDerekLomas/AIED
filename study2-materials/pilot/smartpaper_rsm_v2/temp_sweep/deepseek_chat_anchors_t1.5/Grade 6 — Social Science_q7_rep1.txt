REASONING: This item requires recall of specific state-based factual knowledge (resources of Rajasthan) and a simple explanation, which is more demanding than naming Fundamental Rights but less abstract than identifying a poem's theme. It is likely harder than the 66% anchor but easier than the 15% archaeology item for most Class 6 students.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
