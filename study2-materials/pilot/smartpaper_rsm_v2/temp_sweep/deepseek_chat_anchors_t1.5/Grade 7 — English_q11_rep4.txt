REASONING: This item requires identifying a single-word adjective in a simple sentence, which is a more basic and mechanical grammar task compared to the thematic interpretation, historical differentiation, paragraph writing, or recall of specific facts required by the anchor items. It is most comparable to the Fundamental Rights question (66% pass rate) in its demand for recall of a basic fact, but is likely even simpler.
