REASONING: This question requires specific historical cause-and-effect knowledge (Battle of Plassey → control of Bengal) which is more difficult than naming two Fundamental Rights (66% pass) but likely easier than extracting a poem's theme (5% pass) or differentiating source types (15% pass). It is similar in cognitive demand to the "three questions" item (50% pass), but the required knowledge is more curriculum-specific.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
