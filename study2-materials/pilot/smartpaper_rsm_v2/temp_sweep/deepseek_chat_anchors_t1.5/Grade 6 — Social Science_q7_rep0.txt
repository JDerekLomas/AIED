REASONING: This question requires recall of specific state-specific facts (resources of Rajasthan) and application (explaining influence), which is more demanding than naming two fundamental rights (66% pass rate) but similar in structure to the archaeological vs. literary sources question (15% pass rate), though perhaps slightly easier as it deals with a concrete, local topic.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
