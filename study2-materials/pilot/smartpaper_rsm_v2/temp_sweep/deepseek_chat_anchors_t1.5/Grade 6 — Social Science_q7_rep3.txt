REASONING: This question requires specific knowledge of Rajasthan's geography and economy, similar to the archaeology/literary sources item (15% pass) but with added explanation, making it moderately difficult, likely between the "three questions" (50%) and "fundamental rights" (66%) items in difficulty.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
