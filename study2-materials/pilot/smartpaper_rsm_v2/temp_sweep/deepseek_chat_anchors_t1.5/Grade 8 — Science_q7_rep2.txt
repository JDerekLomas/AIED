REASONING: This item is conceptually simpler than the anchor items, as it asks for an observation and reason related to a common, tangible process (composting) rather than requiring recall of specific literary themes, historical definitions, or constitutional rights. It is most comparable in difficulty to the 50% or 66% anchor items, but likely easier due to its grounding in everyday experience.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
