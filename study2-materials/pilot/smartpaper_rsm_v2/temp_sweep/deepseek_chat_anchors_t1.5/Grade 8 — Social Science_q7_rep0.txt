REASONING: This question requires specific historical cause-and-effect knowledge (Battle of Plassey → control of Bengal), making it more similar in difficulty to the "archaeological vs literary sources" item (15% pass) than to the simpler recall items about Fundamental Rights (66%) or the king's three questions (50%).

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 18%
