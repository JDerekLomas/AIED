REASONING: This item requires recall of specific regional knowledge (Rajasthan's rural occupations) and a brief description, which is more demanding than naming Fundamental Rights (66% pass) but similar in structure to differentiating source types (15% pass). However, the content is concrete and likely covered in the geography syllabus, making it somewhat easier than the poem theme (5% pass).

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
