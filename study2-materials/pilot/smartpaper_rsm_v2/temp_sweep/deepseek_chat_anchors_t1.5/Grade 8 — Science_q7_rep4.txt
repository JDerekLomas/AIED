REASONING: This item is similar to the "favorite season" anchor (30% pass) in requiring basic recall and application of a common environmental process (decomposition/composting), but it demands slightly more structured reasoning, making it moderately harder than that anchor but easier than the poem theme item (5% pass).

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
