REASONING: This question requires specific regional knowledge (Rajasthan) and recalling multiple occupations, which is more demanding than naming two general Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate) but less abstract than identifying a poem's theme (5% pass rate). It is comparable to differentiating source types (15% pass rate) in requiring factual recall and a brief description.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
