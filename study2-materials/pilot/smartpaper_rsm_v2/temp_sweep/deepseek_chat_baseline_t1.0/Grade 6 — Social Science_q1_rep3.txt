struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This is a pure recall question from geography. However, the English phrasing ("mountain ranges located in India") can be a barrier. Many struggling students might know the Hindi names (e.g., "Himalaya") but may not recognize the English term or spell it correctly. The competent and advanced groups are more likely to have practiced the English terms. Common mistakes include naming local hills instead of major ranges, or writing only one range even when two are asked. The rubric is generous (0.5 for one correct name), so even partial recall can earn full marks, helping the basic and competent groups.
