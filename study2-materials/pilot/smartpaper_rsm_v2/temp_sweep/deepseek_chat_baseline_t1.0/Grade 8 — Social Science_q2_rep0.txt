struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. While the topic is taught and discussed in class, the *recall* of a specific, correctly phrased key feature in response to an English prompt is challenging.  

- **Struggling (35%):** Most would not attempt or would write a vague, incomplete point (e.g., "they had good houses"). Only a few who have memorized one key term might score.  
- **Basic (35%):** A significant portion can recall a feature like "drainage system" or "baked bricks," but may not describe it accurately or fully in English, losing marks. Around 40% might manage a complete, correct phrase.  
- **Competent (20%):** They understand the question and know multiple features. Most can correctly describe one, though some may still mix up details (e.g., confusing citadel with lower town).  
- **Advanced (10%):** Nearly all would accurately describe a feature with correct terminology, as they overcome language barriers through better comprehension and recall.
