advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This is a pure recall question from geography. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English names of mountain ranges (e.g., "Western Ghats" instead of "Sahyadri") can be a barrier. Struggling students often mix up terms or cannot recall the exact English names. Basic-level students may recall one major range (like Himalayas) but struggle to name a second correctly. Competent students are familiar with at least two major ranges, while advanced students handle this confidently. Common mistakes include spelling errors, mixing up "Ghats" with "Ghat," or naming local hills instead of major ranges.
