struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- The formula for the area of a triangle is a standard recall item taught repeatedly in Class 6 and 7.  
- Language barrier is minimal here because the question uses only numbers and the words "base," "height," "area," and "triangle," which are familiar terms even in Hindi-medium contexts through routine classroom practice.  
- Struggling students often forget the formula (especially the `1/2` part), confuse it with perimeter, or cannot multiply fractions correctly. Many in this group might leave it blank or attempt wrong operations.  
- Basic-level students usually recall the formula but may make calculation errors (e.g., `8 × 6 = 48` but forget to halve it, scoring 0). Around 60% would likely apply it correctly.  
- Competent and advanced students are very familiar with this direct application; nearly all would score full marks, with rare careless errors in multiplication.
