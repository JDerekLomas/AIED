**Reasoning:**  
- This item tests the basic countable/uncountable noun rule with positive statements ("some" for affirmative, "any" for negative/interrogative).  
- **Struggling students** often cannot read the sentence meaningfully, guess randomly, or pick "any" because it sounds familiar from questions ("Are there any apples?").  
- **Basic level students** may recognize the sentence structure but still confuse "some" and "any" due to L1 interference (Hindi में "kuch" vs. "koi") and lack of exposure. Around 40% might recall the rule with effort.  
- **Competent students** are likely to have internalized this grammar point through practice, though a few may overthink or make slips.  
- **Advanced students** will almost all get it correct, with rare careless errors.  

The specificity of the rule helps those who have been taught it explicitly, but language barriers and limited practice hold back the struggling and basic groups significantly.
