**Reasoning:**  
The question requires direct recall of a specific detail ("magical fairy") from a text. For struggling students, even if the story was read aloud, retaining and reproducing the exact English phrase is a major hurdle; they might recall something "magical" but not the precise term. Basic-level students can often recall the idea but may answer "a fairy" (accepted) or make small phrasing errors. Competent students will reliably recall and write the correct term. Advanced students will answer accurately with ease. The main barriers are English vocabulary recall and the confidence to write the answer independently.
