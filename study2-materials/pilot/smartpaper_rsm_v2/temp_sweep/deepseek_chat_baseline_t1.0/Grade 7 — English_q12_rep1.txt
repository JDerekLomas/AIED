**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily identify the subject, object, and verb in an English sentence. The concept of "voice" is abstract if their first language grammar is not explicitly taught in school.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires applying a grammar rule (changing verb form, reordering parts, adding "by"). Struggling students often fail to recall the structure ("was/were + past participle"). Basic students may attempt but make errors in verb form or word order.  
- **Specificity of answer:** The rubric expects an exact transformation. Common mistakes include: using "was" instead of "were" (subject-verb agreement), omitting "by," writing "blowed" instead of "blown," or incorrectly keeping the same word order ("The wind was blown..." etc.).  
- **Experience:** Competent students usually grasp the pattern after practice. Advanced students handle it confidently. For weaker groups, even if they understand the instruction, execution falters due to limited vocabulary and grammar control.
