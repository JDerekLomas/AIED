**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires a specific recall of the political consequence (establishing control via a puppet ruler). Many struggling students have poor English reading comprehension and may not grasp "contribute to the expansion" clearly, often writing general points about the battle instead. Basic-level students, with some understanding, might recall the victory but often miss the precise link to "political dominance over Bengal" or the role of Mir Jafar, leading to partial answers. Competent students usually grasp the cause-effect and recall key terms, though language may still make expression incomplete. Advanced students comfortably connect the event to the outcome as per the rubric. A Hindi-medium explanation in class would significantly raise scores, but the written English question itself is a barrier.
