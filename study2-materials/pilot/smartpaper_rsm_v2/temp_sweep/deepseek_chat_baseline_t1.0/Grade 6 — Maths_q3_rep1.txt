struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The instruction is short and numbers are universal, so even with limited English, many can guess “arrange in ascending order” means smallest to largest by context or prior classwork.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires comparing place values (4-digit vs 3-digit numbers), which is a basic skill taught repeatedly. Struggling students often miscompare digits beyond the first or second place, or confuse ascending/descending.  
- **Specificity:** Only the smallest number is checked for partial credit here, so even if the full order is wrong, spotting 736 as smallest gives marks. Many struggling students might still miss it if they don’t check all numbers carefully.  
- **Common mistakes:** Some students may compare only the first digit (so 3367, 4799, 5492, 736), others may order by descending if they misread “ascending.” Basic-level students often get it right because the presence of a 3-digit number makes it easier. Competent and advanced students rarely err here.
