**Reasoning:**  
The question requires a specific recall of a cause-effect link (victory → political control via puppet ruler). Many struggling students face language barriers in comprehending "contribute to" and "expansion of British power," and may not recall the precise outcome. Basic-level students often grasp the main idea but might miss key terms like "puppet nawab" or "political dominance," leading to incomplete answers. Competent students typically recall the required link, though some may express it in simpler Hindi-influenced English. Advanced students consistently articulate the rubric point accurately. Common mistakes include vague answers ("British won"), confusing Plassey with other battles, or describing the battle without stating its political consequence.
