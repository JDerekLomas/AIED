**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: recalling the three questions from the text (which are explicitly stated) and then applying simple reasoning to connect one of them to "real life." The main barrier is language comprehension—struggling students often miss key details while reading. Many from Hindi-medium backgrounds might understand the story orally but struggle to retrieve the exact "questions" from the English text. Basic-level students can often recall with prompting but may not frame a "valid reason" clearly. Competent and advanced students grasp both recall and the reasoning link, though some competent students may give overly vague answers. A common mistake is describing the king's actions instead of stating his questions, or writing "yes/no" without a reason.
