**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both **recall** (identifying a line) and **simple reasoning** (explaining why). Many struggling students, due to language barriers and difficulty in reading the poem itself, may not recall a line accurately or may copy one without giving a valid reason. Basic-level students might recall a line but often give vague or incomplete reasons (e.g., "It is nice"). Competent students are more likely to correctly denote a line and give a coherent, if simple, reason. Advanced students typically handle this well, though a few may lose marks if their explanation is too brief or unclear. The rubric is lenient, but specificity in "why" is where marks are often lost.
