**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The problem is short and numbers are clear, but some struggling students may not grasp "temperature increases by 2°C per hour" or confuse 4:00 pm with 4:00 am.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Requires simple reasoning (time difference calculation) and basic multiplication (6 × 2), then addition. Struggling students often miss the time duration step.  
- **Specificity:** Answer must be 42°C; a common mistake is to take time duration as 4 hours (10 to 4) without considering it's evening (pm).  
- **Common mistakes:** Misreading 4:00 as morning, not adding initial temperature, miscalculating hours, or multiplying 2°C wrongly. Competent and advanced students typically handle this well.
