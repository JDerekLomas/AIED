**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires a specific recall of the political consequence (establishing control via a puppet ruler). Many struggling students, due to language barriers and difficulty retaining precise historical cause-effect, would either not attempt it or give a vague answer (e.g., "British won the war"). Basic-level students might recall the win but often miss the "puppet nawab" or "political dominance" phrasing. Competent students generally grasp the key idea and can express it, though sometimes in simpler terms. Advanced students accurately recall and articulate the rubric point. Common mistakes include confusing Plassey with Buxar, describing only the battle events without the political outcome, or writing general statements about British power without linking to Bengal's control.
