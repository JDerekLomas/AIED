struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- The question is pure recall from geography, but the English phrasing ("mountain ranges located in India") can be a barrier. Many struggling students may not understand "ranges" or "located," even if they know the names in Hindi.  
- Competent and advanced students are more likely to recall terms like Himalayas and Western Ghats, which are frequently taught.  
- Common mistakes: naming local hills instead of major ranges, misspelling (e.g., "Himalaya" without 's'), or writing only one range even when two are asked.  
- I factored in that even some basic-level students, with visual teaching (maps, diagrams), can recall at least two well-known ranges.
