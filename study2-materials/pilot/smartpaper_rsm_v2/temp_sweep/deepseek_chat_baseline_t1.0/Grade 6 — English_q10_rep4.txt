**Reasoning:**  
This item tests the basic grammar rule of using "some" in affirmative statements and "any" in questions/negatives. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the concept of countable nouns and article/determiner usage is often transferred incorrectly from Hindi, where such distinctions don't exist in the same way.  

- **Struggling students** largely guess or apply the common mistake of choosing "any" because it feels more familiar from questions like "Are there any apples?"  
- **Basic level students** have a fair chance if they have been drilled on this rule, but many still confuse the two in written form.  
- **Competent students** mostly know the rule but may slip due to lack of reading practice.  
- **Advanced students** almost always get it correct, as they encounter such structures in reading.  

The specificity of the answer ("some" is the only correct option) makes it challenging for those who haven’t internalized the rule through ample exposure or practice.
