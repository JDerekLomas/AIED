**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** (35%) often cannot identify the subject, object, or verb correctly. Converting "blew" to "were blown" requires understanding of past participle and auxiliary verbs, which is challenging without foundational grammar. Many will leave it blank or write an incorrect word order.  
- **Basic students** (35%) might grasp the object-subject swap but often make mistakes in verb form ("was blown" instead of "were blown" for plural "leaves") or omit "by the wind." Partial attempts are common.  
- **Competent students** (20%) usually understand the structure but may occasionally miss plural agreement or preposition use. With focus, most can produce the correct form.  
- **Advanced students** (10%) are familiar with such transformations and will likely answer correctly unless careless.  

The item requires specific grammatical knowledge (passive structure, past participle, auxiliary verb agreement) rather than general reasoning, making it highly dependent on prior teaching and practice, which is inconsistent in this context. Common mistakes include: "The leaves was blown away by the wind," "The leaves blown away by the wind," or reversing meaning entirely.
