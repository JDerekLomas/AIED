struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question requires simple recall of a specific detail ("who lived inside the book?"). However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the challenge is often comprehension of the question itself. Many struggling students may not understand the word "lived" or the phrasing "inside the book," leading to blanks or irrelevant answers. The basic group might understand but recall vaguely ("magic lady," "small girl") instead of "fairy." Competent students are likely to recall the exact term, and advanced students will recall it easily. The specificity of "magical fairy" in the rubric means even correct paraphrases ("a fairy") are accepted, which helps the competent and advanced groups but may not be enough for strugglers who fail to retrieve the key word.
