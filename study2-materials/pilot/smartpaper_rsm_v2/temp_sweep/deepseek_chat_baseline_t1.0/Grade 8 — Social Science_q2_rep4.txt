**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. While the topic is taught and likely revised, the **specificity** of the required answer ("one key feature") means students must recall and reproduce a precise term (e.g., "drainage system," "grid layout," "citadel and lower town").  

- **Struggling students (35%):** Most would struggle to read/understand the English question fully. Even if they know the content in Hindi, translating it accurately into English for writing is a major hurdle. Common mistakes include vague answers ("they had good houses") or mixing up facts from other chapters.  
- **Basic students (35%):** They likely grasp the core concept but may offer incomplete or partially correct answers ("they had drains" instead of "advanced underground drainage system"). Language limits precision. Some may recall one feature correctly in simple English.  
- **Competent students (20%):** They understand the question and can recall at least one key feature accurately, though phrasing may not be textbook-perfect. They are more likely to have practiced such answers.  
- **Advanced students (10%):** They can confidently read the question and reproduce a textbook-standard feature with correct terminology, facing minimal language barriers.
