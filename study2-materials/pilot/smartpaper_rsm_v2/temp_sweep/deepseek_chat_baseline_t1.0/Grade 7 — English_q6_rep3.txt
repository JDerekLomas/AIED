**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and selecting a suitable descriptive word from memory or inference. Many struggling students have very limited vocabulary and may not grasp what "writing style" means. Basic-level students might recall common adjectives (like "simple") if explicitly taught, but often confuse describing the *content* with the *style*. Competent students can reason and apply taught terms more reliably. Advanced students typically manage this well. The main barriers are English comprehension of the question itself and the need for specific, appropriate vocabulary rather than general praise of the poem.
