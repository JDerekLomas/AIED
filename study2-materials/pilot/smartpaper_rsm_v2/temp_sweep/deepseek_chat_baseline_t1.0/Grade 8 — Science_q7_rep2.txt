**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students would not fully comprehend "notice any change," "give reasons," or "evaluate... beneficial for soil health," even if the concept is familiar.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recall (knowing about compost decomposition) and reasoning (linking change to reasons and soil health). Struggling students often miss the "reasons" or "evaluate" part even if they understand something happens.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric expects "significant changes" to be noted, along with reasons (decomposition, microorganisms) and a clear evaluation of benefit. Many basic-level students might only state "it becomes compost" without explaining why or linking to soil health.  
- **Common mistakes:** Students often give incomplete answers, omit scientific terms, or describe physical changes only (smell, color) without connecting to soil enrichment. Competent students can structure the answer, while advanced students comfortably integrate details on humus, nutrients, and soil fertility in simple English.
