**Reasoning:**  
This item tests the basic countable noun rule for affirmative sentences ("some" for positive statements, "any" for questions/negatives). However, for students with Hindi-medium backgrounds, the concept of articles/determiners is challenging as Hindi doesn't have direct equivalents. Many struggling students cannot read the sentence meaningfully, so they guess. Common mistakes include choosing "any" because it sounds familiar from questions ("Are there any apples?"). Competent and advanced students are more likely to recall the rule or have developed an intuitive sense through exposure. The specificity of the answer is high—only one is correct—so guessing yields low accuracy.
