**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily isolate individual words in an English sentence or recall the definition of "adjective." They might confuse it with "subject" or simply pick the noun "bird."  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires recall of a grammar concept (adjective) and its application. Struggling students often lack this foundational recall.  
- **Specificity:** The answer must be the single word "tiny." Common mistakes include choosing "tiny bird" (thinking it describes) or "in our balcony" (confusing it with an adverbial phrase).  
- **Common mistakes:** Hindi-medium students often translate and identify the describing word in Hindi, but fail to map it correctly to the English term "adjective." The competent group has generally mastered this mapping, while the advanced group rarely misses it.
