**Explanation:**  
The question requires recall of specific factual knowledge about Rajasthan's natural resources. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, terms like "gypsum," "sandstone," or "zinc" may be unfamiliar in English, creating a language barrier even if they know the concept. Many struggling students might recall only "water" or "sand" but not two correct formal resources, or they may mix up states. Basic-level students often know common resources like "marble" or "salt" but may struggle to write both correctly in English. Competent students are more likely to recall and write two appropriate terms. Advanced students typically handle such recall questions well. The second part of the question (explanation) is not scored here, so only naming two resources matters, which slightly helps those with limited English writing ability.
