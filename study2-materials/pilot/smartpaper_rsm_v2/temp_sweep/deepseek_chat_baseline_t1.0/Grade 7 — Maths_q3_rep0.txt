struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The formula for the area of a triangle is a standard recall item taught repeatedly in Class 6 and 7. However, many struggling students forget the formula, confuse it with perimeter, or struggle with multiplication of fractions (½ × 8 × 6). Language is less of a barrier here because the numbers are given and the formula is procedural, but some may misread "base" or "height" if they are not comfortable with the English terms.  

- **Struggling:** Only about 10% would recall and apply correctly; many will add or multiply incorrectly.  
- **Basic:** Around 60% would get it right, as they generally remember the formula but may make calculation errors.  
- **Competent:** Nearly all (95%) will recall and compute correctly.  
- **Advanced:** All will score full marks.
