**Reasoning:**  
The item requires recall of a specific, textbook definition. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the challenge is often decoding the question and retrieving the precise English phrasing.  

- **Struggling students (5%):** Most will not recall the exact English terms like "imparts a moral lesson." They may remember it is a story with animals but miss the moral part, or confuse it with other story types.  
- **Basic students (40%):** About half may recall the key elements (short story, animals, moral) but may not phrase it exactly as per the rubric, losing marks for missing specifics.  
- **Competent students (85%):** They understand the question and have the English proficiency to reproduce the definition closely, though some may still omit one key phrase.  
- **Advanced students (95%):** Near-perfect recall, but occasional marks lost due to over-elaboration or minor wording differences.
