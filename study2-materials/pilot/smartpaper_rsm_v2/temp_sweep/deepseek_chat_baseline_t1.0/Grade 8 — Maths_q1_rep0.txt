struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, so even with limited English, students can identify the numbers and the operation. However, struggling students may not understand “find the value of y” or the meaning of the equals sign in an equation.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires basic understanding of inverse operations (subtracting 9 from both sides) or integer subtraction (4 – 9). Many struggling students may add instead of subtract or ignore the negative result.  
- **Specificity of answer:** Only `y = -5` is correct. Common mistakes include writing `y = 13` (adding 9 and 4), `y = 5` (ignoring the negative), or leaving it blank.  
- **Context:** Competent and advanced students are familiar with simple linear equations and integers. Basic-level students might grasp it if guided through examples regularly, but many hesitate with negative numbers. Struggling students often lack confidence and foundational number sense.
