struggling: 20% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- The formula for the area of a triangle is a standard recall item taught repeatedly in Class 6 and 7. However, many struggling students forget the formula, confuse it with perimeter, or struggle with multiplication of fractions (1/2 × 8 × 6).  
- Language barriers are minimal here because the question uses numbers and simple terms ("base", "height", "area") which are commonly used in Hindi equivalents during teaching.  
- Competent and advanced students are very familiar with this direct application.  
- Common mistakes: using `base × height` without halving, calculation errors, or misreading units. Struggling students often lack confidence even in this straightforward question.
