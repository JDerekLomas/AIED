struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This question tests direct recall of a textbook fact, which is both an advantage and a challenge. For the **struggling** group, language barriers (English terms like "grid layout," "drainage system," "citadel") and weak retention mean only a few who memorise key Hindi-translated points might score. The **basic** group can recall a feature if taught repeatedly in bilingual mode, but may not phrase it precisely (e.g., saying "good roads" instead of "grid pattern"). The **competent** group handles such recall questions well, as they revise systematically. The **advanced** group would almost always answer correctly unless they overcomplicate or write vaguely. Common mistakes include confusing features with other civilizations or describing them incompletely (e.g., "they had drains" without mentioning the covered, interconnected system).
