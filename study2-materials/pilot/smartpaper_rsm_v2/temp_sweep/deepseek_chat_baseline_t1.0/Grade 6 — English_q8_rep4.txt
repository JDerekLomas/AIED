**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** often cannot identify the subject ("He") or the verb ("is reading") due to limited vocabulary and unfamiliarity with English sentence structure. Many will jumble the words or write "book is he a reading."  
- **Basic level students** may recognize common words like "book" and "he" but might struggle with the correct placement of "a" and the verb form. Some may produce "He reading a book is" or similar.  
- **Competent students** generally understand subject-verb-object order and can arrange it correctly, though occasional slips with articles or verb forms may occur.  
- **Advanced students** will find this straightforward as it mirrors basic sentence patterns they have practiced.  

The task requires reasoning about word order rather than recall, which is harder for Hindi-medium students due to differing syntactic rules (SOV in Hindi vs. SVO in English). The specificity of the rubric ("He is reading a book.") also limits flexibility, making it challenging for those who might use alternative valid arrangements like "A book he is reading."
