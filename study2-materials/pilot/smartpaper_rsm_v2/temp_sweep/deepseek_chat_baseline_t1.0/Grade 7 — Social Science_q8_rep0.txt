struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires recalling specific terms like "agriculture" or "animal husbandry," which may not be familiar in English to Hindi-medium students. Many struggling students would know the concepts in Hindi (kheti, pashupalan) but may not write the English terms correctly or may spell them poorly, losing marks. Basic-level students have a fair chance if they recall at least two terms, but language remains a barrier. Competent students can generally bridge the language gap and recall correctly. Advanced students are very likely to answer accurately, though occasional spelling errors may still occur.
