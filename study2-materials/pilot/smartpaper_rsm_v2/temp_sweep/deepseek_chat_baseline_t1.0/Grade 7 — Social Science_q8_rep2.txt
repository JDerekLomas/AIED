struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for many Hindi-medium students. While the content (rural occupations of Rajasthan) is familiar from their surroundings and textbooks, the challenge is accurately reading, comprehending, and recalling the specific English terms.  

- **Struggling students (10%):** Most would not fully decode the question. Even if they know the answer in Hindi, writing "Agriculture" or "Animal Husbandry" correctly in English is a major hurdle. Some might write incomplete or phonetically spelled words.  
- **Basic students (40%):** They can grasp the gist of the question. With effort, they can recall and write at least two terms, though spelling may be approximate (e.g., "agriculcher," "animal husbandry"). The "describe any one" part might be very brief or omitted.  
- **Competent students (80%):** They understand the question well and can recall the standard textbook terms. They are likely to score full marks, though minor spelling issues may occur. They can manage a basic description.  
- **Advanced students (95%):** They have strong enough English comprehension and content recall to answer accurately and concisely. The rare error might be due to overcomplication or oversight.  

**Common mistakes:** Misreading "Rajasthan," confusing "rural" with "urban," writing occupations in Hindi only, listing only one occupation, or providing a vague description instead of a specific one.
