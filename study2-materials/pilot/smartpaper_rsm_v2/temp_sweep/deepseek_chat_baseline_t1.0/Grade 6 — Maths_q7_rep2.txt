struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The problem is short and numbers are clear, but “temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour” may confuse some Hindi-medium students if not explained verbally.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Requires understanding elapsed time (10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours) and repeated addition/multiplication (6 × 2 = 12, then 30 + 12 = 42). Struggling students often miss the time calculation or add temperatures incorrectly.  
- **Specificity:** Answer must be `42^0 C` for full marks; partial credit not considered here.  
- **Common mistakes:** Using 4 hours instead of 6 (10 am to 4 pm confusion), forgetting to add initial temperature, misreading “evening” as 4 am, or calculation errors in multiplication/addition.
