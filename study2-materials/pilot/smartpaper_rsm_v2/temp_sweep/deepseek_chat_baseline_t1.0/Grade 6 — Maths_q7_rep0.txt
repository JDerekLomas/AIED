struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The problem is short and numbers are clear, but “temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour” may confuse some Hindi-medium students if not explained verbally.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Requires two-step reasoning: calculating 6 hours elapsed, then multiplying 2°C × 6 and adding to 30°C. Struggling students often miss one step or misidentify the time duration.  
- **Specificity:** Answer must be numeric (°C), so small arithmetic errors cost full marks.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  - Confusing 4:00 pm with 4:00 am (thinking 4 hours difference only).  
  - Adding 2°C only for each hour but starting from 10 am (e.g., 10→12→2→4 counted as 4 intervals).  
  - Arithmetic errors in multiplication/addition.  
- **Experience:** Competent and advanced students handle this well; basic students often get time calculation wrong; struggling students rarely complete both steps correctly even if the concept is explained.
