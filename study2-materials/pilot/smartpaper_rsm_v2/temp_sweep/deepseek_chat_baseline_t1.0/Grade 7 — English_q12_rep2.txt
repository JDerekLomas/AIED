**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling group:** Most cannot identify subject/verb/object in English. The concept of voice is abstract. They might write "The leaves blew away" or jumble words.  
- **Basic group:** Can often identify "leaves" as what is acted upon, but common mistakes include using "was" instead of "were" (subject-verb agreement), omitting "by the wind," or writing "blowed" (past participle error).  
- **Competent group:** Understands the structure but may occasionally make minor errors in tense ("are blown") or preposition. Most can recall the passive form with reasonable accuracy.  
- **Advanced group:** High accuracy; errors are rare and usually due to oversight.
