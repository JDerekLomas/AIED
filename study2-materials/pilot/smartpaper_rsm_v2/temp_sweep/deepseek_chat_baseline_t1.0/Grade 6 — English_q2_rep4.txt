**Reasoning:**  
The question requires direct recall of a specific detail ("magical fairy") from a story. For struggling students, even if they understood the story when read aloud, retrieving and writing the exact English phrase is a major hurdle due to language barriers and spelling anxiety. Basic-level students might recall the idea but often answer with "a fairy" (which should be accepted) or misspell it (e.g., "fairly"), leading to possible mark deduction depending on strictness. Competent students can typically recall and write the answer accurately. Advanced students face no difficulty. The main challenge is not reasoning but vocabulary recall and written expression in English.
