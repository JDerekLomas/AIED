struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is short and numbers are given, so even students with limited English can often identify “base,” “height,” and the numbers 8 and 6.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is direct recall and application of a standard formula taught repeatedly. Struggling students may forget the formula or confuse it with perimeter; basic-level students usually remember it but may make calculation errors (e.g., forgetting to multiply by 1/2).  
- **Specificity:** The rubric only requires stating or using the correct formula, so even if the final calculation is wrong but the formula is correctly written with substitution, they could still get full marks. However, in practice, teachers here often expect the final numerical answer.  
- **Common mistakes:** Forgetting to divide by 2, using `base × height` directly, misplacing decimal, or writing incorrect units. Struggling students also sometimes add base and height instead of multiplying.  

Given the simplicity and high repetition of this topic, even many basic-level students will get it right, but struggling students often fail to recall or apply the formula correctly under exam conditions.
