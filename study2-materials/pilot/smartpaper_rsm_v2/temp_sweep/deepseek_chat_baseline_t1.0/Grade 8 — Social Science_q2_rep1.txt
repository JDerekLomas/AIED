struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. While the topic is taught and likely revised, the **specific recall** of a named "key feature" is required. Struggling students often mix up facts (e.g., say "they wrote on seals" which is not planning) or cannot recall the precise term in English. Basic-level students may recall a feature but describe it vaguely (e.g., "good roads" instead of "grid layout") and lose marks for lack of specificity. Competent students generally grasp and retain the key terms taught through repetition and diagrams. Advanced students consistently recall accurate, textbook-aligned answers. The marking is strict for a one-point item, so even minor inaccuracies in terminology would result in no score.
