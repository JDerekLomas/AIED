struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This is a pure recall question from geography. The main barriers are:  
1. **Language:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students may not understand "mountain ranges" clearly, even if they know the Hindi terms (पर्वत श्रृंखला).  
2. **Recall specificity:** They must recall and spell names correctly (e.g., "Himalayas" is common, but "Aravalli" or "Western Ghats" might be forgotten or misspelt).  
3. **Common mistakes:** Mixing up hills/mountains, naming local hills instead of major ranges, or writing only one range even if they know two.  

The **Himalayas** is very well-known, so many in the basic group may get one correct. Competent students likely know two major ranges. Advanced students might recall precisely, though a few may overthink and write less common ranges incorrectly.
