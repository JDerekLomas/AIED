**Reasoning:**  
The task requires constructing a coherent paragraph with three specific details. For the **struggling** group, significant language barriers and difficulty forming complete sentences mean most responses will be incomplete or off-topic. The **basic** group can often list points but may struggle with sequencing, correct tense, or explaining 'why' clearly. The **competent** group typically meets all rubric points, though with minor grammatical errors. The **advanced** group consistently writes complete, clear paragraphs. Common mistakes include copying the question stem, using incorrect prepositions (e.g., "I do it on Sunday"), and vague reasons for enjoyment.
