struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** often cannot identify the subject ("He") or the verb ("is reading") correctly. Many try a literal Hindi word order ("He a book reading is") or miss the article "a".  
- **Basic level students** may grasp the subject-verb-object order but often place "a" incorrectly ("He is reading book a") or confuse "is he" as a question. About 40% get it right after some trial.  
- **Competent students** mostly understand English sentence structure. Mistakes, if any, are careless (like omitting "a"), so a high majority score full marks.  
- **Advanced students** find this straightforward and consistently arrange the words correctly.
