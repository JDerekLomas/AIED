**Reasoning:**  
- This item tests the basic countable noun rule ("some" for affirmative statements, "any" for questions/negatives).  
- **Struggling students** often guess or confuse "some" and "any" due to limited exposure and interference from Hindi structures (like "kuch" used broadly). Many cannot read the sentence independently.  
- **Basic students** may recognize the pattern if taught recently, but under exam pressure, common mistakes persist (e.g., picking "any" because it feels more familiar).  
- **Competent students** generally grasp this rule through practice, though occasional slips happen.  
- **Advanced students** rarely miss this, but a small percentage might overthink or misread.  
- The question requires recall of a specific grammar rule, not deep reasoning, but language barriers and lack of practice in English-speaking environments significantly impact the lower groups.
