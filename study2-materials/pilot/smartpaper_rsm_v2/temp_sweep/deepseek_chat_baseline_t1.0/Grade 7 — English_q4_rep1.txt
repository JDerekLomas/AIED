**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: **recalling** the three specific questions from the text (which many struggling/basic students may miss or confuse due to reading difficulties) and then applying **simple reasoning** to connect any one of them to "real life." The main barrier is language and recall. Struggling students often cannot locate or retain specific textual details. Basic students might recall one question vaguely but struggle to articulate a clear reason. Competent students can usually recall and give a valid reason (e.g., "Yes, because knowing the right time helps us succeed"). Advanced students handle this easily. Common mistakes include copying irrelevant lines from the passage or answering only "yes/no" without a reason.
