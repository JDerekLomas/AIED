**Reasoning:**  
The question is a direct recall item from a story. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the barrier is often accessing the text in the first place. Struggling students may not have comprehended the story or may miss the specific phrase "magical fairy," writing "a lady" or "a girl" instead. Basic-level students might recall a character but not the exact term, though a significant portion would get it. Competent students, who follow the story well, will recall accurately. Advanced students will have no difficulty. The specificity of "magical fairy" versus just "fairy" might lower scores slightly for some, but the rubric accepts both, which helps.
