**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students would not fully comprehend "notice any change," "give reasons," or "evaluate... beneficial for soil health," even if the concept is familiar.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recalling the concept of composting and reasoning about changes (like smell, heat, reduction in volume, formation of manure) and linking it to soil health. Struggling students often fail to connect processes to reasons.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric expects "significant changes" to be noted with reasons. Many basic-level students might only write "it becomes compost" without describing changes or explaining soil benefits.  
- **Common mistakes:** Students often write vague answers like "it rots" or "manure is made," missing the observation part (e.g., "the heap shrinks, becomes dark, crumbly") and the explicit soil health benefit (adds nutrients, improves texture). Advanced students are more likely to structure a complete answer.
