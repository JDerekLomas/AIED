struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The question is numeric, so language is less of an issue here, though the instruction “Arrange in ascending order” may confuse some struggling learners if not explained in Hindi.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires comparing place values (number of digits, then thousands/hundreds place comparison), which is reasoning-based but practiced often.  
- **Specificity:** Only the smallest number needs to be identified for full marks, making it easier.  
- **Common mistakes:** Some students may compare only the first digit (so 3367 seen as smaller than 736), or misread digits due to lack of place value clarity. Struggling students often fail to recognize that 736 (3-digit) is smallest. Basic-level students may still mix order after identifying smallest. Competent and advanced students usually handle this correctly.
