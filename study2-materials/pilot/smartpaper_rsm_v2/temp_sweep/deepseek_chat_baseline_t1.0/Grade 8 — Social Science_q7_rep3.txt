**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires a specific recall of the political consequence (establishing control through a puppet ruler). Many struggling students would not comprehend the question fully due to language barriers or might only recall "British won" without the required detail. Basic-level students, with some grasp, often mix up Plassey with Buxar or give vague answers like "British became powerful." Competent students usually recall the key point about Mir Jafar and control over Bengal. Advanced students consistently provide the precise rubric answer. In practice, even competent students may lose marks if they cannot articulate "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" clearly in English.
