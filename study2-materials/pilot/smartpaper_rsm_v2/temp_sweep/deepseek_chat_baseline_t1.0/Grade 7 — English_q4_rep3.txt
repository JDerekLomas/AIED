**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: recalling the three questions from the text (which is challenging for students with language barriers) and then applying simple reasoning to give *any* valid real-life reason. Many struggling students will fail at the recall step or will not comprehend the question fully. Basic-level students may recall the questions but often give overly vague or incomplete answers. Competent students can typically manage both recall and a basic reason. Advanced students handle it comfortably. A common mistake is copying a line from the text about the king without explicitly linking it to a reason for importance in real life.
