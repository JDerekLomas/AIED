**Explanation:**  
The question is in English, which immediately creates a barrier for many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. While the content (natural resources of Rajasthan) is taught, the phrasing may confuse struggling learners who cannot decode "natural resources" or "influences the lives." This requires both recall of specific names (like marble, gypsum, sunlight) and a basic explanation—a two-step task that lower-ability students often find challenging.  

Common mistakes include:  
- Listing incorrect resources (e.g., coal, iron for Rajasthan).  
- Only naming one resource or failing to explain properly.  
- Writing vague explanations without clear cause-effect (e.g., "People use it" without saying how).  

Competent and advanced students, who can navigate English instructions and recall taught examples, perform much better. The advanced group may still lose marks occasionally due to oversimplified explanations or spelling errors in key terms.
