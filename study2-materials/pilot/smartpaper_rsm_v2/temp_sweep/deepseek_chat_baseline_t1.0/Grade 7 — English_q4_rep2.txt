**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: **recall** (of the three questions from the passage) and then **reasoning** (to connect one of them to real life). The language barrier is significant. Struggling students often fail to comprehend the question itself or cannot retrieve the specific details from the text. Basic-level students might recall the questions but struggle to articulate a clear, valid reason in English. Competent students can generally manage both recall and simple reasoning. Advanced students handle it well. A common mistake is to narrate the story instead of giving a reason, or to give an irrelevant reason due to misreading the question. The rubric is generous ("any valid reason"), which helps, but the initial comprehension hurdle remains high for the lower groups.
