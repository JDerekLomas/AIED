**Reasoning:**  
The task requires constructing a coherent paragraph with three specific details. Many struggling students have very limited vocabulary and sentence formation skills, often writing just a single clause or copying the question. Basic-level students can usually state a hobby and one other point (often "when" or "why"), but frequently miss one required element or make grammatical errors that break clarity. Competent students typically manage all elements in simple, clear sentences. Advanced students exceed expectations with fluency. The main barriers are generating original sentences in English and remembering to include all three parts without prompting.
