struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 50% full marks  
competent: 90% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The problem is short and numbers are clear, but “temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour” may confuse some Hindi-medium students if not explained verbally. Struggling students often miss such key phrases.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Requires two steps: calculating 6 hours elapsed (10 am to 4 pm) and multiplying 2°C/hour by 6, then adding to 30°C. Struggling students often fail at step 1 (time calculation) or lose track of step 2.  
- **Specificity:** Answer must be numeric (°C). Many basic-level students might correctly find 6 hours but forget to add initial 30°C, giving 12°C as final answer (common mistake).  
- **Common mistakes:** Misreading 4:00 as 4 am, not understanding “per hour” increase, arithmetic errors in multiplication/addition, or stopping after finding total increase without adding to starting temperature.  

Given mixed abilities, the competent and advanced groups handle such multi-step word problems well, while basic-level students have about a 50% success rate after classroom practice. Struggling students rarely complete both steps correctly without individual support.
