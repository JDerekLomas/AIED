struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 30% full marks  
competent: 70% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students will have difficulty comprehending "notice any change," "reasons," and "evaluate... beneficial for soil health," even if the concept is familiar.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recall (knowing about decomposition/compost) and reasoning (linking the change to soil health). Struggling students often miss the "reasons" part or give incomplete answers.  
- **Specificity required:** A full-mark answer needs to state a change (e.g., waste reduces, turns into manure, smell, heat), give a reason (decomposition by microorganisms), and explicitly state it is beneficial for soil (adds nutrients/organic matter). Basic students often stop at "it becomes compost" without explaining why it's good for soil.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  - Vague answers: "Yes, change happens."  
  - Missing the soil health link: They describe compost but don't evaluate benefit to soil.  
  - Confusion with burning or waste disposal concepts.  
- **Experience:** Competent and advanced students grasp the integrated demand of the question. Basic students can recall compost but struggle to structure the complete answer. Struggling students are often derailed by language, leading to minimal or irrelevant responses.
