**Reasoning:**  
The task requires constructing a simple, cohesive paragraph with three specific elements. For the **struggling** group, significant language barriers and difficulty forming complete sentences in English mean most will omit one required part or write disjointed phrases. The **basic** group can often produce the content but may struggle with coherence, tense, or clarity on "why," reducing the success rate. The **competent** group typically manages all elements with minor errors that may not detract from clarity. The **advanced** group will consistently meet the rubric, with rare omissions due to oversight. The task relies on personal recall and simple sentence framing, but for Hindi-medium learners, generating even basic English output is a substantial cognitive task.
