**Reasoning:**  
- The question is in English, which is a barrier for many Hindi-medium students. Understanding terms like "natural resources" and recalling specific names (e.g., gypsum, sandstone) requires prior teaching in accessible language.  
- It tests **recall** more than reasoning, which helps competent and advanced students who have memorized the chapter. Struggling students often confuse natural resources with agricultural products or fail to recall exact names.  
- A common mistake is listing incorrect examples (e.g., wheat, cotton) or explaining influence vaguely without linking to lives (e.g., "marble is used" without saying for buildings/employment).  
- Basic students may recall one resource but struggle to mention two correctly or explain influence clearly. Competent students typically manage both parts. Advanced students score near-full unless they face language issues in writing the explanation.
