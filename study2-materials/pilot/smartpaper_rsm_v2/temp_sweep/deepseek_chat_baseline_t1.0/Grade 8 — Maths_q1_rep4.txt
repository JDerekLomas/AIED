struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, so even with limited English, students can identify the numbers 9 and 4. The variable `y` is common in algebra. However, struggling students may still be intimidated by the English format.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires understanding the inverse operation (subtracting 9 from both sides) and handling negative numbers. Many struggling and basic-level students forget or avoid negative numbers, often answering `y = 13` (adding instead of subtracting) or `y = 5` (subtracting 4 from 9).  
- **Specificity:** Only `y = -5` is correct. No partial credit.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  - Incorrect operation: `y = 9 + 4` → `y = 13`  
  - Wrong subtraction: `y = 4 - 9` but written as `y = 5` (ignoring sign)  
  - Leaving blank due to fear of negatives/algebra.  

Advanced students handle this easily. Competent students mostly get it, but some slip with the negative sign. Basic students have partial understanding; struggling students are often lost in algebra involving integers.
