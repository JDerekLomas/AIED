**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive adjective. Many struggling students have very limited vocabulary and may not grasp what "writing style" means. Basic-level students might understand the question but often choose vague or incorrect words (e.g., "good," "nice"). Competent students can usually identify a relevant style like "simple" or "descriptive" if taught explicitly. Advanced students consistently apply appropriate vocabulary. The language barrier and need for precise vocabulary make this challenging for the lower groups, even though it is a 1-mark recall/interpretation item.
