**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both **recall** (identifying a line) and **simple reasoning** (explaining why). Many struggling students, due to language barriers and difficulty in reading the poem itself, may not recall a line accurately or may write an incomplete/incorrect reason. Basic-level students can often pick a line but struggle to articulate a clear "why" in English, often giving vague or copied reasons. Competent students are more likely to manage both parts, though some may lose marks for lack of specificity. Advanced students typically handle it well, but a few may overcomplicate or not justify clearly. Common mistakes include misquoting the line, giving a reason unrelated to the line, or writing the reason in Hindi without English translation.
