**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive adjective. Many struggling students have very limited vocabulary and may not grasp what "writing style" means. Basic-level students might understand the question but often choose vague or incorrect words (e.g., "good," "nice"). Competent students are more likely to recall taught terms like "simple" or "descriptive." Advanced students can accurately identify and apply appropriate terms. The language barrier and need for specific vocabulary make this challenging for the lower groups.
