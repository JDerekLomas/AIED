advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires recall of specific terms like "agriculture" or "animal husbandry," which may not be familiar in English to Hindi-medium students. Many struggling students might know the concepts in Hindi (kheti, pashupalan) but fail to translate or write them correctly in English. The basic group has a higher chance as they can often recall one occupation but may not list two correctly. Competent students generally manage both recall and basic English terms. Advanced students are comfortable with the language and content. Common mistakes include vague answers ("farmer," "goat keeping") or listing only one occupation.
