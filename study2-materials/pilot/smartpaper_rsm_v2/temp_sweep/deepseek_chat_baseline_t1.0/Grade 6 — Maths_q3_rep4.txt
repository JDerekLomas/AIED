struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The question uses only numbers and simple instruction ("Arrange in ascending order"), which is a familiar phrase in math lessons even for Hindi-medium students. Minimal reading is required.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires comparing place values (4-digit vs 3-digit numbers) and ordering them. Struggling students often confuse ascending/descending or miscompare numbers like 3367 and 4799 if they only look at the first digit.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric awards 0.5 marks only for identifying the smallest number (736) and placing it first. Many struggling students might order all numbers incorrectly but still get the first number right by chance or partial understanding.  
- **Common mistakes:** Some students order by first digit only (736, 3367, 4799, 5492) or reverse the order (descending). Others might misread digits due to lack of place value clarity.  

Given these factors, most competent and advanced students will handle it easily. Basic-level students have a fair grasp of comparing numbers, but errors occur. Struggling students find even basic ordering challenging, so a small percentage get it correct.
