struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
This question tests **recall** of a specific, well-known fact from the textbook. However, the **language barrier** is significant—many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to understand "key feature," "urban planning," or "Harappan Civilization" in the question itself, even if they know the content.  

- **Struggling (35%):** Most would not recall the precise term or would describe a vague, incorrect feature. Some might write "they were old" or "they had houses." Only a few who have memorized the exact point in Hindi and can translate it roughly will score.  
- **Basic (35%):** A larger portion can recall one feature if taught repeatedly using bilingual methods (e.g., "drainage system" as "nali vyavastha"). However, they may write incomplete or misspelled answers, losing marks if the rubric is strict. About 40% would give a scorable answer.  
- **Competent (20%):** They understand the question and can accurately recall and write at least one feature correctly, though language errors may persist. Most will score.  
- **Advanced (10%):** They know multiple features and can articulate one clearly in simple English. Near-perfect recall, but occasional slips in expression may occur.
