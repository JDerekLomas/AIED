**Reasoning:**  
This item tests the basic grammar rule of using "some" in affirmative statements and "any" in questions or negatives. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the concept of countable/uncountable nouns and article/determiner usage is often transferred incorrectly from Hindi, where such distinctions don't exist in the same way.  

- **Struggling students** largely guess or apply the familiar word "any" (commonly heard in "Do you have any...?"). Many cannot read the sentence with comprehension.  
- **Basic level students** might recognize the sentence structure but often confuse "some" and "any" due to lack of practice and interference from Hindi. Around 40% would recall the rule correctly.  
- **Competent students** are familiar with this pattern from drills and textbook examples, though occasional slips happen.  
- **Advanced students** rarely make this error, but a small percentage might overthink or second-guess if the basket is assumed to be empty.
