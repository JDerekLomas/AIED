**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** often cannot identify the subject ("He") or the verb ("is reading") due to very limited vocabulary and sentence structure awareness in English. Many will jumble the words randomly or write "book is he a reading".  
- **Basic level students** have some familiarity with common words and the "subject + is + verb-ing + object" pattern from classroom drills, but many might still miss the article "a" or place it incorrectly (e.g., "He is reading book a"). Around 40% would get it exactly right.  
- **Competent students** understand basic sentence structure and can apply the pattern; most will get it correct, though a few might still make careless ordering errors.  
- **Advanced students** will easily recognize the SVO structure and place the article correctly, so nearly all will score full marks.  

The task requires **reasoning with known grammar patterns**, not just recall. The specificity of the answer ("a" must be placed before "book") is a common hurdle for Hindi-medium learners, as articles do not exist in Hindi.
