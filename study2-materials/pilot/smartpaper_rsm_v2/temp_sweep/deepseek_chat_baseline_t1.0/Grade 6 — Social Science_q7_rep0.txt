**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students will have difficulty comprehending "natural resources" and "influences the lives," even if they know the local examples.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** The first part (mentioning two resources) is pure recall, which many competent and advanced students can manage if taught. The second part (explaining influence) requires simple explanation, which becomes challenging for those with limited vocabulary.  
- **Specificity:** Students often mix up "natural resources" with agricultural products (like wheat) or general geographical features (like desert). Common mistakes include listing "sand" (from the desert) instead of specific minerals, or failing to explain the "influence" clearly (e.g., just writing "marble is used for buildings" without linking to jobs/livelihood).  
- **Experience:** Struggling students often leave such questions blank or write irrelevant points. Basic-level students might recall one resource (like salt or marble) but struggle to complete both parts correctly. Competent and advanced students, especially if taught with local examples and bilingual support, can score well.
