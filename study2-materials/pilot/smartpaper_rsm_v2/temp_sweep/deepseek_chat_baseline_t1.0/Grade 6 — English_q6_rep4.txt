**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both **recall** (finding/remembering a line) and **simple reasoning** (explaining why). Many struggling students, due to language barriers and low reading confidence, may either not recall a line accurately or give a reason like "it is nice" without meeting the rubric's requirement of "mentions why." Basic-level students can often pick a line but struggle to articulate a clear, relevant reason in English. Competent students typically manage both parts adequately, though some may lose marks if their explanation is too vague. Advanced students usually handle this well, as they can express personal preference with a coherent reason. Common mistakes include copying a line incorrectly, giving a reason in Hindi only, or stating "I like it because it is good" without meaningful justification.
