advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English, which creates an immediate barrier for many Hindi-medium students. While the content (rural occupations of Rajasthan) is familiar from their textbook and surroundings, the requirement to *recall and write specific terms in English* ("Agriculture," "Animal Husbandry") is the main hurdle. Struggling students often fail to decode the question or produce the correct English terms even if they know the concepts. Basic-level students may manage one occupation correctly but often miss the second or spell it incorrectly. Competent students generally understand the question and can recall two terms, though minor spelling errors may occur. Advanced students are comfortable with the language and content, so they score near-perfectly. Common mistakes include writing Hindi words, giving only one occupation, or listing vague/general answers instead of the specific ones from the textbook.
