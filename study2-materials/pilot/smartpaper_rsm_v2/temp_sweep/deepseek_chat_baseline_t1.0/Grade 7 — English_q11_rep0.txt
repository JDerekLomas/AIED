**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily isolate individual words by function in an English sentence. They may confuse "tiny bird" as one unit or pick "in our balcony" as a phrase.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires knowing the definition of an *adjective* (recall) and applying it to find which word describes the noun (reasoning). Struggling students often lack both.  
- **Specificity:** The answer must be a single word ("tiny"), not the noun phrase ("tiny bird"). Common mistake: choosing "tiny bird" or "in our balcony."  
- **Common mistakes:** Hindi-medium students sometimes translate and identify adjectives based on Hindi word order, leading to errors. Also, weaker students may select the whole subject or prepositional phrase instead.
