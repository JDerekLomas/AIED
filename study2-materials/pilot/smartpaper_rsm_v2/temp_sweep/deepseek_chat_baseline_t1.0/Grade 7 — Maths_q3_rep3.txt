struggling: 15% full marks  
basic: 60% full marks  
competent: 95% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is short and numbers are given, so even students with limited English can often identify “base,” “height,” and the numbers 8 and 6. However, struggling students may still be confused by the English phrasing.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This is direct recall and application of a standard formula taught repeatedly in Class 6 and 7. No complex reasoning is needed.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric only requires stating or using the correct formula. Even if calculation errors occur (e.g., ½ × 8 × 6 = 24), they would still get full marks if the formula is correctly applied.  
- **Common mistakes:** Struggling students often forget to multiply by ½ (giving 48 cm²), confuse area with perimeter, or cannot recall the formula at all. Basic-level students usually recall it but may make arithmetic slips, though the rubric here is generous about that. Competent and advanced students rarely fail on such a direct item.
