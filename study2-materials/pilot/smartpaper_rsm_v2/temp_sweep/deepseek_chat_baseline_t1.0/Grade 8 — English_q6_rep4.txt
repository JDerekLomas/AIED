struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question requires a precise, textbook definition. For **struggling** students, language barriers and weak recall mean most will not reproduce the exact phrase "uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson." They may only say "a short story with a lesson."  

**Basic** students have likely heard the term but may miss one key element (e.g., omit "animals as characters" or confuse "moral" with "message"). Around 40% can recall both parts correctly.  

**Competent** students understand and recall the definition well, though some may phrase it informally. A small percentage may still forget to mention "animals."  

**Advanced** students will almost all answer correctly; the rare error might come from overcomplicating the answer.
