struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, but some struggling students may not understand “find the value of `y`” or the meaning of the equals sign in an equation context.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires basic inverse operation reasoning (“what number plus 9 gives 4?”). Struggling students often add 9 and 4 or subtract 4 from 9, getting 13 or 5, not −5. Many in the basic group may still hesitate with negative numbers.  
- **Specificity of answer:** Only `y = −5` is correct; no partial credit. Students who avoid negative answers might leave it blank or write 5.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  1. Transposing incorrectly: writing `y = 4 + 9 = 13`.  
  2. Subtracting but in wrong order: `y = 9 − 4 = 5`.  
  3. Not attempting due to fear of algebra/negatives.  

Advanced students rarely err here; competent ones mostly grasp it, but a few may slip in sign. Basic group has mixed success; struggling group largely finds it challenging.
