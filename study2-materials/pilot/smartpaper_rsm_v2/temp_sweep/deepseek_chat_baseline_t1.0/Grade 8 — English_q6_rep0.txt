**Reasoning:**  
The question requires a precise, textbook definition. For the **struggling** group, language barriers and difficulty recalling formal definitions mean most would either leave it blank, write a vague line ("story with animals"), or miss the "moral lesson" part. The **basic** group might recall one element (animals or moral) but often fail to combine both accurately. The **competent** group can generally reproduce the definition if taught explicitly, though some may phrase it imperfectly. The **advanced** group will recall it accurately, with only occasional slips in wording. The key hurdle is the specific combination of "short story," "animals as characters," and "moral lesson" in a single sentence—which demands both comprehension and memory of English terminology.
