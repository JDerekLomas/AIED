struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, but some struggling students may not understand “Find the value of `y`” or the `=` sign in an algebraic context.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires basic inverse operation reasoning (“what number plus 9 gives 4?”). Struggling students often add both given numbers (9+4=13) or subtract but in the wrong order (9-4=5).  
- **Specificity of answer:** Only `y = -5` is correct. Many basic-level students might answer `5` because they avoid negative numbers or misapply subtraction.  
- **Common mistakes:** Fear of negative numbers, misreading the operation, or copying the problem incorrectly. Competent and advanced students are comfortable with integers and simple equations.
