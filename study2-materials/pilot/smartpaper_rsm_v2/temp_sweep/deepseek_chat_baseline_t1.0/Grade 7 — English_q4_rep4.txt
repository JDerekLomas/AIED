**Reasoning:**  
The question requires two steps: recalling the three questions from the text (which are explicitly stated) and then applying simple reasoning to connect one of them to "real life." The main barrier is language comprehension—many struggling and basic students may not fully understand the phrasing "important in real life" or may fail to extract the specific questions from the passage despite having read/heard the story. Common mistakes include giving a yes/no answer without a reason, or describing the story instead of justifying the importance. Competent and advanced students, with better English comprehension, can typically recall the questions and provide a valid reason (e.g., "Yes, because knowing the right time to do things helps us succeed"). However, some competent students might still struggle to express the reason clearly.
