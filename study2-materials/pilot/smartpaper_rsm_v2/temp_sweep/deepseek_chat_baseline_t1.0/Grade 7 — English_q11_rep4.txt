**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily isolate individual words by function in an English sentence. They may confuse "tiny bird" as a single unit or pick "in our balcony" as a phrase.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires knowing the definition of an *adjective* (recall) and applying it to find which word describes the noun (reasoning). Struggling students often lack both.  
- **Specificity:** The answer must be a single word ("tiny"), not the noun phrase ("tiny bird"). Common mistakes include selecting the whole noun phrase or the prepositional phrase.  
- **Common mistakes:** Hindi-medium students sometimes translate directly and identify "bird" as the subject, not recognizing "tiny" as a separate descriptive element. Only competent and advanced students typically grasp this distinction clearly.
