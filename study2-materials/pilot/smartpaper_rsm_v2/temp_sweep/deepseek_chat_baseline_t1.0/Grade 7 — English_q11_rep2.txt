**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily isolate individual words for grammatical function, especially when the adjective ("tiny") is not a familiar word. They might incorrectly choose "tiny bird" or "in our balcony" as a phrase.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recall of the definition of an adjective (describing word) and the ability to apply it to identify a single word, not a phrase. The rubric expects "tiny," but students often identify noun phrases instead.  
- **Specificity:** The answer must be one word, which is tricky for those who confuse "adjective" with "adjective phrase." Many competent students get it right because they focus on the word describing the noun.  
- **Common mistakes:** Common errors include selecting "tiny bird" (thinking 'phrase' means group of words) or "in our balcony" (misidentifying prepositional phrase as descriptive). Advanced students rarely make these mistakes.
