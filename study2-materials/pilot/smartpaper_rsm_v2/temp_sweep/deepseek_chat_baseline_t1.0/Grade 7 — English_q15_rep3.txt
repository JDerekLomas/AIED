**Reasoning:**  
The task requires constructing a coherent paragraph with three specific details, which is a challenge for students with limited English proficiency. The **struggling** group often cannot form complete sentences or stick to the topic. The **basic** group can attempt it but frequently miss one element (usually "why") or make grammatical errors that obscure meaning. The **competent** group typically understands and follows the structure, though with minor mistakes. The **advanced** group usually meets all criteria clearly. The main barriers are vocabulary recall, sentence formation anxiety, and the need to generate original content rather than just copy.
