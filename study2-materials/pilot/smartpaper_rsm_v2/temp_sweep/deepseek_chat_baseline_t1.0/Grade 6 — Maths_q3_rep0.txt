basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The question is numeric, so language is less of an issue here. However, some struggling students may not understand “ascending order” even if demonstrated before, due to limited English recall.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires understanding place value (comparing thousands, hundreds) and the meaning of ascending order — more procedural recall than deep reasoning, but place value itself is a challenge for many struggling learners.  
- **Specificity:** The rubric awards 0.5 only if smallest number (736) is placed first. Common mistakes:  
  1. Comparing only first digits incorrectly (thinking 736 is largest because 7 > 5,3,4 without noticing it has fewer digits).  
  2. Writing in descending order by mistake.  
  3. Misreading digits due to lack of practice with larger numbers.  
- **Experience:** Struggling group often fails on place value beyond 3-digit numbers; basic group can manage if attentive, but errors occur; competent and advanced groups usually handle this unless careless.
