**Reasoning:**  
The item requires precise recall of a literary term's definition. The rubric demands two specific elements: "animals as characters" and "moral lesson." Many struggling students, due to language barriers and limited exposure to English literary terms, may recall only one part (e.g., "story with a moral") or confuse it with other forms like parable. Basic-level students might grasp the moral part but often miss the "animals as characters" specification. Competent students typically recall both parts but may occasionally phrase it imperfectly. Advanced students are very likely to reproduce the textbook definition accurately.
