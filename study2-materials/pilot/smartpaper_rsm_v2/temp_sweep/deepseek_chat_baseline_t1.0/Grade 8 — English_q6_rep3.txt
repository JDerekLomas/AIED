**Reasoning:**  
The item requires a precise, textbook-style definition. While "moral lesson" is a familiar concept, the specific term "fable" and the requirement to mention "animals as characters" make it challenging for students with limited English proficiency and vocabulary recall.  

- **Struggling students** often confuse fable with story, parable, or proverb. Even if they understand the concept in Hindi (नीति कथा), expressing it accurately in English is a major barrier.  
- **Basic level students** might recall one part (e.g., "story with a moral") but often omit "animals as characters" or struggle with phrasing.  
- **Competent students** generally know the definition but may occasionally miss a key element under exam pressure.  
- **Advanced students** typically recall it accurately, though rare slips in wording (like using "birds" instead of "animals") might occur.
