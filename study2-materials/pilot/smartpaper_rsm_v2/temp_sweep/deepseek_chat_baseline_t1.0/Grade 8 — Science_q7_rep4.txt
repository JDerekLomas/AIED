struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 20% full marks  
competent: 60% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students would not fully comprehend "notice any change," "give reasons," or "evaluate if this is beneficial," even if they know the concept of composting.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recall (knowing about decomposition/composting) and reasoning (linking change to reasons and soil health). Struggling students often miss the "reasons" or "evaluate" part even if they recall change.  
- **Specificity required:** To get full marks (0.5), they must state change (e.g., waste reduces, becomes dark, smells), give a reason (decomposition by microbes), and state benefit to soil (adds humus/nutrients). Common mistakes: only saying "yes, change happens" without explanation, or confusing it with burning of waste.  
- **Experience:** Competent and advanced students grasp the integrated answer structure. Basic students often give incomplete answers. Struggling students might only write "yes" or copy words from the question without correct reasoning.
