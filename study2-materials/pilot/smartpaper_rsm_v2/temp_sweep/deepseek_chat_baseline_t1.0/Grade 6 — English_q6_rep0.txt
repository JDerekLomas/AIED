**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both **recall** (identifying a line) and **simple reasoning** (explaining why). The main barriers are:  
1. **Language comprehension** – Struggling students often cannot read the poem fluently or recall exact lines.  
2. **Expression in English** – Even if they have a reason, phrasing it in English is difficult for Hindi-medium learners.  
3. **Specificity** – The rubric demands mentioning *why*, which many basic-level students might only do in vague or incomplete terms.  

Common mistakes:  
- Quoting an incorrect or incomplete line.  
- Giving a reason like "It is nice" without elaboration.  
- Writing the reason in Hindi or mixed language, which may not be fully credited.  

Advanced students handle this well, competent students mostly manage, but basic and struggling groups are significantly hindered by language and expression gaps.
