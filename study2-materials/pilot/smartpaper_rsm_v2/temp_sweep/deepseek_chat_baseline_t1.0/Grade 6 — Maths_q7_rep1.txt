advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The problem is short and numbers are clear, but some struggling students may not understand “temperature increases by 2°C per hour” or confuse “4:00 in the evening” with 4:00 am.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** Requires simple reasoning (time difference calculation) and multiplication (6 × 2), then addition (30 + 12). Struggling students often miss one step, especially finding the 6-hour gap.  
- **Specificity:** Answer must be exact (42°C). Common mistakes include calculating time wrong (e.g., 10 to 4 as 4 hours), forgetting to add initial temperature, or misreading “4:00 in the evening.”  
- **Experience:** Competent and advanced students handle this well; basic students often make one error; struggling students usually fail to interpret the word problem correctly even if they can multiply.
