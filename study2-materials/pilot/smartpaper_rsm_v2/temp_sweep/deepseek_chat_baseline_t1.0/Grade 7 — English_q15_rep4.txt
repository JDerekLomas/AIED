struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Explanation:**  
The task requires constructing a coherent paragraph with three specific details. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with sentence formation and vocabulary. The "struggling" group would mostly write incomplete sentences or copy the question. The "basic" group might manage a simple list-like answer but often miss one element (usually "why"). The "competent" and "advanced" groups can generally follow the structure, though some may make minor grammatical errors. The rubric is clear, but language barriers make execution difficult for the lower groups.
