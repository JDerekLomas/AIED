struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question has two clear parts: **mentioning** two resources and **explaining** one's influence. The main barriers are:  
1. **Language:** The English phrasing may confuse Hindi-medium students, especially words like "influences" and "natural resources." Many struggling students might not fully comprehend what is being asked.  
2. **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Remembering two resources from Rajasthan is recall-based (taught in geography lessons), but explaining the influence requires connecting the resource to people's lives—a step that demands comprehension and expression, which is harder for weaker students.  
3. **Specificity:** Students often list incorrect or vague resources (e.g., "soil," "crops" instead of minerals/energy sources). For explanation, they might state "water is important" without detailing how it influences agriculture/livelihood.  
4. **Common mistakes:** Mixing up resources with manufactured goods, writing only one resource, or copying incomplete points from textbooks without understanding.  

Given these factors, struggling students largely fail to complete both parts correctly; basic students can often recall two resources but give weak explanations; competent and advanced students handle both well, though some may lose marks on clarity.
