struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic-level students cannot easily isolate individual words by function in an English sentence. They may confuse "adjective" with "word describing the bird" or pick the whole phrase "tiny bird" instead of just "tiny".  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires recalling the definition of an adjective and applying it to identify a single word. Struggling students often fail at the recall step; basic students may recall but misapply.  
- **Specificity:** The answer must be exactly "tiny". Common mistakes include choosing "tiny bird" (noun phrase) or "in our balcony" (prepositional phrase).  
- **Common mistakes:** Hindi-medium students often translate word-by-word and may think "bird" is being described, so they select both words. Also, lack of practice with meta-language (terms like *adjective*) lowers accuracy in lower groups.  

The advanced group mostly gets it correct, with rare slips. Competent students generally understand but some overthink and choose phrases. Basic students are inconsistent, while struggling students are largely guessing or confused by the terminology.
