**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires a specific recall of the political consequence (puppet nawab/control over Bengal). Many struggling students have poor English reading comprehension and may not understand "contribute to the expansion," or they might recall only "British won" without the required detail. Basic-level students, with some grasp, often mix up Plassey with Buxar or give vague answers like "British became powerful," missing the precise rubric point. Competent students usually understand the demand and recall Mir Jafar/puppet rule, though some may express it imperfectly. Advanced students consistently identify the key cause-effect and phrase it acceptably. In practice, even competent students sometimes lose marks if they focus only on military victory without stating the establishment of political control.
