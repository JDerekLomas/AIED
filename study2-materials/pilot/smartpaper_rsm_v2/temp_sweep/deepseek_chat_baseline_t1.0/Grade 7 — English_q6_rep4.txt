**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive adjective. Many struggling students have limited comprehension of the poem itself and may not grasp what "writing style" means. Basic-level students might understand the poem but struggle to articulate the style in a single appropriate English word. Competent students can likely connect the poet's language to a descriptor like "simple" or "descriptive." Advanced students will confidently identify and supply the correct term. Common mistakes include leaving it blank, copying a line from the poem, or using vague/incorrect words due to vocabulary gaps.
