**Reasoning:**  
This is a direct recall question from a story, but success depends heavily on the student's ability to read and comprehend the English text. Many struggling students, especially from Hindi-medium backgrounds, may not decode the question or the original passage correctly. They might recall a character but not the exact term "magical fairy" (e.g., write "lady," "angel," or leave it blank). Basic-level students, with partial comprehension, might remember "fairy" but often miss the specific phrase "magical fairy." Competent and advanced students, with better reading skills, can locate and recall the exact answer, though some competent students may still simplify it to "fairy." The advanced group would almost all get it correct, with rare slips.
