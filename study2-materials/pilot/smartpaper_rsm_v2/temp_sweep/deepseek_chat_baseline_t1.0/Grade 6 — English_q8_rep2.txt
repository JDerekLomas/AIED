**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** often cannot identify the subject ("He") or the verb ("is reading") due to very limited vocabulary and confusion with word order. Many will write "book is reading a he" or similar.  
- **Basic level students** may recognize "He" as the starting word but often mix up "a is" or place "reading" incorrectly. With guidance, some can arrive at the correct structure through trial and error.  
- **Competent students** generally understand basic sentence structure (S-V-O) and can rearrange correctly, though some may still miss the article "a" placement.  
- **Advanced students** find this straightforward as they regularly encounter and construct such simple sentences.  

The task requires **reasoning with basic grammar rules** rather than pure recall, which is challenging for those with Hindi-medium backgrounds where sentence structure differs (S-O-V common). The specificity of the answer ("He is reading a book") leaves little room for variation, increasing difficulty for learners still grasping articles and continuous tense.
