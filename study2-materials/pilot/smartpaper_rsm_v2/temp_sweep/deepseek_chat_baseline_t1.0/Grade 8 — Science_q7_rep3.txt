struggling: 5% full marks  
basic: 25% full marks  
competent: 60% full marks  
advanced: 90% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The question is in English. Many struggling and basic-level students would fail to fully comprehend "notice any change," "give reasons," and "evaluate... beneficial for soil health," even if they know the concept practically.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires both recall (knowing about decomposition/compost) and reasoning (linking the change to soil health). Struggling students often miss the "reasons" or "evaluate" part even if they recall something is changing.  
- **Specificity required:** To get full marks (0.5), they must clearly state change (e.g., waste reduces, turns into compost), give reason (decomposition by microorganisms), and state benefit to soil (adds nutrients/humus). Many basic-level students might only state change or benefit incompletely.  
- **Common mistakes:** Students write "waste rots" without scientific reason; some confuse it with burning waste; many from Hindi background directly translate "pit" but miss "soil health" evaluation. Competent students can structure the answer, while advanced ones articulate it precisely.
