**Reasoning:**  
This question requires both **recall** (denoting a line) and **simple reasoning** (explaining why). Many struggling students cannot read the poem fluently or recall exact lines; they often copy a random line without a valid "why." Basic-level students can often pick a line but struggle to articulate a reason beyond "it is nice" due to limited vocabulary and confidence. Competent students typically manage both parts, though their reasoning may be brief. Advanced students handle it well. The main barriers are English reading comprehension, vocabulary for expression, and understanding that "why" requires a personal or poetic justification.
