**Reasoning:**  
The question is in English and requires recall of specific terms like "agriculture" and "animal husbandry." Many struggling students would fail to understand the question itself due to language barriers, even if they know the local occupations. Basic-level students might grasp the question but often mix up terms or give incomplete answers. Competent students can navigate the English and recall at least two correct occupations. Advanced students are comfortable with the language and content. A common mistake is listing only one occupation or using vague local terms instead of the standard textbook ones.
