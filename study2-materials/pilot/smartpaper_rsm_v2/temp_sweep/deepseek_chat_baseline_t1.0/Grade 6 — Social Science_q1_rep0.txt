struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 80% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
The question is pure recall from geography, but the English phrasing ("mountain ranges located in India") can be a barrier. Many struggling students might know local or Hindi names (e.g., "Himalaya") but may not write it in the exact English form required, or may recall only one range. Basic-level students often know the Himalayas but might struggle to name a second correctly. Competent students are likely to recall at least two standard ranges. Advanced students would handle this easily, though occasional spelling errors ("Aravali" vs "Aravalli") might still occur. The rubric is lenient (any two from a list), which helps, but recall depends heavily on whether the topic was recently taught and reinforced in their primary language.
