**Reasoning:**  
The question requires understanding the abstract concept of "writing style" and recalling or inferring a suitable descriptive adjective. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited proficiency, the terms "simple" or "descriptive" may not be readily accessible. Many struggling students would leave it blank or copy a line from the poem instead. Basic-level students might attempt but often choose irrelevant or vague words (e.g., "good," "nice"). Competent students can usually identify a correct style if discussed in class, but may sometimes mismatch the adjective. Advanced students, with better vocabulary and comprehension, consistently provide accurate answers. The specificity of the rubric (one word) makes it challenging for those with limited vocabulary recall.
