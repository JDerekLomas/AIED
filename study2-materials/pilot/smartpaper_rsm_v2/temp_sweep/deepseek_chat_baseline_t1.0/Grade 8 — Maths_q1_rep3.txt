competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 95% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barrier:** The equation is short and numbers are universal, so even with limited English, many can decode “y + 9 = 4”.  
- **Concept difficulty:** Students often struggle with integers, especially moving a number to the other side and understanding negative results. Many in the struggling group might answer “5” or “13” by incorrect addition/subtraction.  
- **Recall vs reasoning:** This requires basic inverse operation reasoning (“what number + 9 gives 4?”). Struggling students may not grasp negative numbers conceptually.  
- **Common mistakes:** Writing `y = 4 + 9 = 13` (not changing sign), or leaving blank if unsure about negatives.  
- **Advanced group** may still make rare careless errors, hence not 100%.
