struggling: 10% full marks  
basic: 40% full marks  
competent: 85% full marks  
advanced: 100% full marks  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Language barriers:** The question is numeric, so language is less of an issue here. However, some struggling students may not understand “ascending order” even if demonstrated before, due to limited English recall.  
- **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires understanding place value and comparing numbers — more reasoning than pure recall. Struggling students often miscompare numbers by looking only at the first digit (e.g., thinking 3367 is smaller than 736 because 3 < 7).  
- **Specificity of answer:** Only one correct sequence; small slip leads to zero marks.  
- **Common mistakes:**  
  1. Comparing only the first digit.  
  2. Arranging in descending order by mistake.  
  3. Misreading digits (especially if handwritten poorly).  
  4. Forgetting to include all numbers in the sequence.  

Even competent students occasionally reverse order, but most grasp place value well. Advanced students handle this confidently.
