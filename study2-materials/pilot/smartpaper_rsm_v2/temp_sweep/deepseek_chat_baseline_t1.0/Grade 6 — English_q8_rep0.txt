**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students (35%):** Most have very limited English word recognition and sentence structure understanding. They often jumble words randomly or write "a he book reading is." The concept of subject-verb-object in English is not internalized. Only a few with some grasp of basic word order might get it correct.  
- **Basic students (35%):** They can recognize common words like "he," "is," "a," "book." They have been exposed to simple sentences like "He is a boy." The pattern "He is [verb]ing a [noun]" is familiar from classroom drills. However, common mistakes include placing "a" incorrectly ("He is a reading book") or missing the continuous tense. About 60% would likely arrange it correctly after some thought.  
- **Competent students (20%):** They understand basic sentence structure well. The task is straightforward for them. The main risk is careless errors, not lack of understanding. Hence, a high success rate (~95%).  
- **Advanced students (10%):** This is a simple exercise for them. They would almost always get it correct (100%).  

**Key factors considered:**  
1. **Language barrier:** Hindi-medium students think in S-O-V ("He a book reading is") which causes interference.  
2. **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires applying a learned syntactic pattern, not creative production. Basic and above students have practiced this pattern.  
3. **Specificity:** The rubric allows only one correct answer, leaving little room for variation, which lowers scores for strugglers.  
4. **Common mistakes:** Missing articles ("He is reading book"), incorrect verb form ("He reading a book"), or Hindi word order direct translation.
