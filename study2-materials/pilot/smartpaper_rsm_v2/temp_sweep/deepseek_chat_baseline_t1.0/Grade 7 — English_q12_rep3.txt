**Reasoning:**  
This item requires specific grammatical knowledge (passive voice structure, past participle of "blew", use of "by") rather than general comprehension. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with English verb forms and sentence structure. The struggling group largely cannot identify the verb or object; many would leave it blank or write a jumbled sentence. The basic group might attempt it but commonly make mistakes like "The leaves was blown away by the wind" or "The leaves blown away by wind." The competent group generally knows the rule but may occasionally miss the plural agreement ("were") or the "by" phrase. The advanced group will typically get it correct, with rare careless errors.
