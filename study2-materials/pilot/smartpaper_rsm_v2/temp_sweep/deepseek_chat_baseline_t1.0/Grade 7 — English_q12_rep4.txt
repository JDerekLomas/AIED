**Reasoning:**  
- **Struggling students** have very limited grasp of verb forms (blew → were blown) and sentence structure. They often confuse word order or simply copy the sentence. The concept of "by the wind" being added is also a major hurdle.  
- **Basic level students** might recall the rule but make errors in tense (using "was" instead of "were" for plural leaves) or omit "by the wind." Some might write "The leaves are blown by the wind," ignoring the past tense.  
- **Competent students** generally understand the transformation but may occasionally miss the plural verb agreement ("was blown") or the adverb "away." Most can apply the rule correctly with minor slips.  
- **Advanced students** typically handle this accurately, as it's a standard drill. Rare errors might include spelling or unnecessary article addition.  

The item requires specific grammatical knowledge (past tense, plural subject, preposition "by") rather than general reasoning, making it highly dependent on prior teaching and practice, which many from Hindi-medium backgrounds find challenging due to differences in verb conjugation and passive construction in Hindi.
