REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "Fundamental Rights" question, as it requires recall of specific geographical/social facts, but it's slightly harder due to the descriptive element. It's easier than the "Archaeological vs. Literary Sources" question because it doesn't require differentiation or complex definitions.
