REASONING: This question requires recalling a specific formula and applying it with given numbers. This is similar in cognitive demand to the 66% anchor item (recalling two fundamental rights) and the 50% anchor item (recalling three questions from a passage), as both require direct recall of information. However, it also involves a simple calculation, which might slightly increase the difficulty for some students compared to pure recall. Given the numerical context, it's likely to be slightly harder than the 66% item but potentially easier than the 50% item if the formula is well-practiced.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
