REASONING: This question is harder than the 66% and 50% anchor items because it requires recall of specific geographical facts and an explanation, not just direct retrieval from a passage or common knowledge. It is comparable to the 30% anchor item in terms of requiring recall and a short explanation, but the content (natural resources of a specific state) might be less universally known than "favorite season." It is easier than the 5% and 15% anchors which require abstract thinking or more complex differentiation.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
