REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the Fundamental Rights question (66% pass rate) and the King's questions (50% pass rate) as it requires recall of a specific definition, which is a common type of question. However, "fable" might be a less frequently encountered term than "Fundamental Rights" or "king's questions" (which would have been directly from a reading passage). Students might struggle with recalling the "moral lesson" aspect.
