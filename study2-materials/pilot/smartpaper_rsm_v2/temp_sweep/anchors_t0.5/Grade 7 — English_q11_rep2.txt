REASONING: This question is significantly harder than the 66% and 50% pass rate anchor items, as it requires specific grammatical knowledge that is often challenging for Class 7 students. It's even harder than the 30% item, which is a creative writing task. It's comparable to the 15% item in terms of specific knowledge recall but is likely harder because "adjective phrase" is a more nuanced concept than simply differentiating historical sources. The 5% item requires abstract thematic understanding, which is a different skill set. Identifying an adjective *phrase* when the answer is a single adjective is a common point of confusion.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 10%
