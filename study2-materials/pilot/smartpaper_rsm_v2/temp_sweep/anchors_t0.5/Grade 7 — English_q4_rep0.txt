REASONING: This question requires students to connect the story's themes to their own lives, which is a higher-order thinking skill than simply recalling facts (like the 50% anchor) but less abstract than identifying a poem's theme (5% anchor). The open-ended nature of "any valid reason" makes it more accessible than a very specific rubric.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
