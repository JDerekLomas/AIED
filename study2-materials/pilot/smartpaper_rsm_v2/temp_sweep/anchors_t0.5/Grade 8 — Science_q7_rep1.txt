REASONING: This question requires students to recall basic scientific concepts related to decomposition and apply them to a real-world scenario. While the concept of decomposition might be familiar, articulating the "changes," "reasons," and "benefits for soil health" in a coherent manner might be challenging for students, similar to the "Archaeological vs. Literary sources" question which required both definition and example. However, it's less abstract than the "Last Bargain" poem theme.
