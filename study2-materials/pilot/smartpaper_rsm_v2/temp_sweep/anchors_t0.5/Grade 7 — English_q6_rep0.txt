REASONING: This question requires students to analyze and interpret the *style* of writing, which is a higher-order thinking skill than recalling facts or summarizing content. It's more abstract than identifying a theme (5% pass rate), differentiating historical sources (15%), or even writing a short paragraph on a personal topic (30%). While it only requires one word, finding the *right* descriptive word for a writing style is challenging for Class 7 students, especially those in a government school setting where rote learning is often emphasized.
