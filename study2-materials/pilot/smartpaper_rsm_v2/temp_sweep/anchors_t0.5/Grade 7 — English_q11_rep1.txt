REASONING: This question is significantly harder than the "Fundamental Rights" and "King's Questions" anchors, as it requires specific grammatical knowledge that is often challenging for Class 7 students. It's comparable to the "My Favorite Season" anchor in requiring application of learned concepts, but "adjective phrase" is a more abstract and less frequently practiced concept than writing a simple paragraph. The common error will likely be identifying "in our balcony" as the phrase, or "built its nest" or "a tiny bird".
