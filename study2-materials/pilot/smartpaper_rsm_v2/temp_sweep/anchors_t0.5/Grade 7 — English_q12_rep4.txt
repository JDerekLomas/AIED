REASONING: This question requires an understanding of grammatical transformation, specifically active to passive voice. While it's a direct application of a grammar rule, the complexity of verb tense change (blew to were blown) makes it harder than simple recall (like Fundamental Rights or the King's questions) but potentially easier than abstract thematic interpretation or detailed historical differentiation.
