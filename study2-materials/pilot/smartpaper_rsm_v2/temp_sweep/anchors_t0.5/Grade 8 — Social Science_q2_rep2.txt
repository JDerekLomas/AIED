REASONING: This question requires recall of a specific historical fact, similar to naming Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate) but perhaps slightly more detailed than just naming. However, it's less abstract than understanding a poem's theme (5%) or differentiating historical sources (15%). It's also a direct recall, not requiring interpretation or extended writing like "My favorite season" (30%).
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
