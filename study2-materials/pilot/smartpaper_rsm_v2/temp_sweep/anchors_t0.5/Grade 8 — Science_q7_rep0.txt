REASONING: This question requires students to recall basic concepts of decomposition and its benefits, which is a core topic in Class 8 Science. While it asks for reasoning and evaluation, the fundamental concept is relatively straightforward and frequently discussed. It's harder than direct recall questions like Fundamental Rights but easier than open-ended interpretation like "The Last Bargain" or differentiating historical sources, as it relates to a concrete, observable scientific process.
