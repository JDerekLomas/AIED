REASONING: This question requires students to recall a specific formula and apply it with given numbers. This is a direct application of learned mathematical knowledge, similar to the "Fundamental Rights" question in terms of recall, but with a calculation step. The calculation is straightforward multiplication and division by 2. This is likely to be easier than the English comprehension or history differentiation questions, but potentially harder than simply listing two memorized facts.
