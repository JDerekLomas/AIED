REASONING: This question is harder than the 50% and 66% pass rate anchors because it requires interpretation and personal connection to the text, not just recall. It's similar in difficulty to the "My favorite season" question (30% pass rate) as both require personal expression and justification, but "My favorite season" is a more common topic. It's easier than the "The Last Bargain" theme question (5% pass rate) because it doesn't demand a deep thematic analysis, just a preferred line and a simple reason. It's also easier than the "Archaeological vs. Literary sources" question (15% pass rate) as that requires factual differentiation and examples.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
