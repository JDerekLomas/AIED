REASONING: This question involves a basic algebraic manipulation (subtraction) which is a core concept taught in Class 8. While some students might make errors with negative numbers, it is significantly less complex than understanding themes in poetry, differentiating historical sources, or writing coherent paragraphs. It is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" question in terms of direct recall/application, but involves a mathematical operation rather than memorization.
