REASONING: This question requires students to connect the story to their own understanding of real life, which is a higher-order thinking skill than simply recalling facts (like the 50% anchor) or naming rights (66% anchor). However, it's open-ended enough that a simple, relevant reason will suffice, making it less demanding than the theme question (5% anchor) or the differentiation question (15% anchor). The "My favorite season" (30% anchor) is a good comparison, as both require personal reflection, but this question is more abstract.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
