REASONING: This question is a multi-step word problem involving time and simple arithmetic (multiplication and addition). While it doesn't require complex mathematical concepts, the need to calculate elapsed time and then apply the rate of change might be challenging for some students, similar to the multi-step nature of the "King's questions" or "favorite season" paragraphs. However, it is more straightforward than abstract concepts like poem themes or historical sources.
