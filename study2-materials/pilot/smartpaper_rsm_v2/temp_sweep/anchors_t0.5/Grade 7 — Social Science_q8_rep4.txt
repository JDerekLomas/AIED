REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the 66% pass rate anchor item (Fundamental Rights) as it requires recall of specific facts taught in class, but also a brief description, making it slightly more challenging. It's easier than the 50% anchor because it doesn't require extracting information from a passage.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
