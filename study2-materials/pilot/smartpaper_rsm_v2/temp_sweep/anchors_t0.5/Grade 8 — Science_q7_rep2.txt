REASONING: This question requires students to recall basic science concepts about decomposition and its benefits, which is a common topic in Class 8 science. While it asks for reasoning and evaluation, the core concept is straightforward and likely covered in textbooks. It's harder than direct recall questions (like Fundamental Rights) but easier than abstract interpretation (like the poem's theme) or detailed differentiation (like historical sources).
