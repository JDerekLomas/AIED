REASONING: This item is significantly easier than all the anchor items. It tests a basic grammar concept (some/any) that is often covered in early primary grades, requiring simple recall rather than comprehension, analysis, or extended writing. Students are likely to have encountered this rule multiple times, and even if they haven't explicitly learned it, the correct option often "sounds" right due to common usage. The anchor items, even the easiest ones, require either factual recall of specific curriculum content (Fundamental Rights, King's questions) or basic paragraph writing, which are more complex tasks for Class 6 students.
