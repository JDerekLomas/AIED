REASONING: This question is significantly harder than the 66% and 50% pass rate anchors because it requires specific grammatical knowledge that is often challenging for Class 7 students. It's even harder than the 30% pass rate anchor, which asks for a simple paragraph. It's comparable to the 15% anchor (differentiating sources) in requiring specific definitions, but "adjective phrase" is a more abstract concept than "archaeological source." It's not as difficult as the 5% anchor (theme of a poem) which requires abstract interpretation and synthesis. The rubric only asks for "tiny" which is an adjective, not an adjective *phrase*, which might confuse students who are looking for a phrase. If they only need to identify "tiny", it's slightly easier, but still requires understanding parts of speech. Given the general struggles with abstract concepts and specific grammatical terms, even identifying a single adjective can be tricky.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 10%
