REASONING: This question is harder than the "Fundamental Rights" and "King's Questions" items, as it requires inferential thinking about literary style rather than recall of factual information or direct extraction from text. It's comparable to "My Favorite Season" in requiring some original thought but is slightly more abstract. It's easier than "The Last Bargain" theme question, as "writing style" is a more concrete concept than "theme" for this age group, and many simple, correct answers are possible.
