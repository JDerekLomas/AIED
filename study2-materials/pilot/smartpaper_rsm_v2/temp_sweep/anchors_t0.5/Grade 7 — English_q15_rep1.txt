REASONING: This item is similar in structure and cognitive demand to the "My favorite season" anchor item (30% pass rate) but requires slightly fewer sentences and focuses on a more personal, potentially less complex topic than a season. It's also similar to the "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) in that it asks for specific information from memory/personal experience. It's harder than the Fundamental Rights question (66%) because it requires more than simple recall.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
