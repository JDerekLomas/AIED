REASONING: This question requires an understanding of grammatical transformation, specifically active to passive voice. While it's a direct application of a grammatical rule, the complexity of "blew" changing to "were blown" might be challenging for some students, similar to the difficulty of identifying a poem's theme or differentiating historical sources. It's likely harder than recalling factual information but easier than complex sentence construction.
