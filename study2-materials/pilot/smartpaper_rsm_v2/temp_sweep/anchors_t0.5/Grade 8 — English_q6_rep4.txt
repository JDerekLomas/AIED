REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "Fundamental Rights" question (66% pass rate) as it requires recall of a simple definition, which is a common type of question in Class 8. It's easier than the "King's questions" (50%) as it's a direct definition, not requiring extraction from a passage.
