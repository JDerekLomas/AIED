REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the 50% pass rate anchor item ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?") as it requires recall of the king's questions and then a simple, personal application. However, it is slightly harder because it requires an additional step of giving a *reason*, which can be challenging for students who struggle with expressing their thoughts.
