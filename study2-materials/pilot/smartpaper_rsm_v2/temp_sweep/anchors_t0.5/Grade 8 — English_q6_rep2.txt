REASONING: This question requires recalling a definition, similar to "Define archaeological/literary sources" (15% pass rate), but "fable" is a more common literary term and the definition is less complex. It's harder than simply naming facts (50-66%) but easier than thematic analysis (5%).
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
