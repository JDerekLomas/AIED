REASONING: This question is harder than the 66% and 50% anchor items because it requires recall of specific geographical facts and an explanation of their impact, rather than just direct retrieval from a passage or general knowledge. However, it's easier than the 5% and 15% items as it's a factual recall from the curriculum, not requiring abstract interpretation or complex differentiation. It's comparable to the 30% item in that it asks for specific factual recall and a brief explanation, but the content (natural resources of a specific state) might be less personally engaging than "My favorite season."
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
