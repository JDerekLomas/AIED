REASONING: This item is similar in structure and cognitive demand to the "My favorite season" paragraph (30% pass rate) but is slightly easier due to fewer required lines (4-5 vs. 6-8) and a more universally accessible topic (hobbies vs. seasons, which might have cultural nuances or less personal connection for some). It's harder than the "Fundamental Rights" question (66% pass rate) as it requires sentence construction and personal expression rather than recall.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
