REASONING: This question is a direct recall from a story, likely requiring students to remember a specific detail. It is similar in difficulty to the "three questions the king wanted to answer" item (50% pass rate) as both require direct recall of a specific plot point, but perhaps slightly easier as it's a single, clear entity. It's significantly easier than the "Last Bargain" theme (5%) or "archaeological vs. literary sources" (15%) which require higher-order thinking or factual knowledge beyond a specific text.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
