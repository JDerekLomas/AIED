REASONING: This question requires an understanding of grammatical transformation, specifically active to passive voice. While it's a direct application of a grammar rule, it involves more than simple recall (like the Fundamental Rights) and is less abstract than identifying a poem's theme. The common errors for this type of question often involve incorrect verb forms (e.g., "was blowed") or omitting parts of the passive structure. Given the relatively low pass rates for even seemingly straightforward tasks, this will likely be in the middle range, similar to the "favorite season" paragraph or slightly harder due to the specific grammatical rule.
