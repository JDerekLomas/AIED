REASONING: This question is harder than the "Fundamental Rights" and "King's Questions" anchors because it requires interpretation and vocabulary beyond simple recall from the text. It's comparable to the "My Favorite Season" anchor in requiring some original thought, but perhaps slightly harder as "writing style" is a more abstract concept than describing a season. It's easier than "The Last Bargain" theme question, as "writing style" is less abstract than "theme."
