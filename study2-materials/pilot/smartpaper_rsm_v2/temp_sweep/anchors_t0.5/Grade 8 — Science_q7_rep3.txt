REASONING: This question requires students to recall basic science concepts about decomposition and apply them to a real-world scenario. While the language is straightforward, the need to provide reasons and evaluate benefits for soil health makes it more complex than simple recall. It's harder than naming fundamental rights or identifying facts directly from a passage, but potentially easier than the abstract theme of a poem or differentiating historical sources, as decomposition is a more tangible concept.
