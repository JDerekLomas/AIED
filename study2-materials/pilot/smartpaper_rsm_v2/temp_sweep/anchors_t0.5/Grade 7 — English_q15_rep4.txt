REASONING: This item is similar in structure and cognitive demand to the "My favorite season" anchor (30% pass rate), requiring personal expression within a defined structure. However, "My Favourite Hobby" might be slightly easier as "hobby" is a common and relatable concept, and students often have a clear idea of their leisure activities, potentially leading to more complete responses. It is harder than the "Fundamental Rights" (66%) and "King's questions" (50%) as it requires original sentence construction rather than recall.
