REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "Fundamental Rights" question, requiring recall of a specific factual detail from the textbook. It's easier than the "Archaeological vs. Literary Sources" question because it only asks for one feature, not a differentiation with examples. It's much easier than the "Last Bargain" question which requires abstract thematic understanding.
