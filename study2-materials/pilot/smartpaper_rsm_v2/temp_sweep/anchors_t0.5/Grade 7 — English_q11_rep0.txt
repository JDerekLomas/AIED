REASONING: This question is significantly harder than the "Fundamental Rights" and "King's Questions" anchors, as it requires specific grammatical knowledge that is often challenging for Class 7 students. It's comparable to, if not slightly harder than, the "Favorite Season" paragraph, as that allows for more open-ended expression. It's definitely easier than the "Theme of Poem" and "Archaeological vs. Literary Sources" questions, which demand higher-order thinking and more complex understanding. The common misconception will be to identify "in our balcony" as the adjective phrase, or to struggle with the concept of a phrase versus a single word.
