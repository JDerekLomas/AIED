REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "My favorite season" prompt (30% pass rate) because it requires personal expression and a simple justification, but it's slightly harder as it requires recalling a specific line from a poem. It's easier than the "Last Bargain" theme question, as it doesn't require deep thematic analysis.
