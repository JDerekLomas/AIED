REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "Fundamental Rights" question, as it requires recall of a definition that should have been taught. It is easier than the "Last Bargain" theme question which requires deeper comprehension, and easier than the "Archaeological vs. Literary sources" which requires differentiation and examples. It is harder than the "King's three questions" which is direct recall from a passage, and harder than "My favorite season" which is a personal paragraph.
