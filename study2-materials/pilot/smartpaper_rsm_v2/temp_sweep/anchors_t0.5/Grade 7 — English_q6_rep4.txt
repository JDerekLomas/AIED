REASONING: This question is harder than the "Fundamental Rights" and "King's Questions" items because it requires inferential thinking about literary style, which is a higher-order skill than recalling facts or directly extracting information from a text. It is comparable to the "My Favorite Season" item in terms of requiring expression, but "writing style" is a more abstract concept than describing personal preferences. It is easier than the "Last Bargain" theme question, as "writing style" is a more concrete concept than "theme."
