REASONING: This question is a direct application of a formula that Class 7 students are expected to know and practice regularly. It is much easier than the "Last Bargain" or "Archaeological vs. Literary Sources" questions, which require deeper comprehension and analytical skills. It's comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" question in terms of recall, but the math problem involves a simple calculation, which might be a slight hurdle for some.
