REASONING: This question requires an understanding of grammatical transformation, specifically active to passive voice. While it's a direct application of a grammar rule, the complexity of verb tense change (blew to were blown) makes it harder than simple recall or direct extraction from text, but easier than thematic interpretation or multi-part definitions.
