REASONING: This question is significantly harder than the 66% and 50% pass rate anchor items, as it requires specific grammatical knowledge that is often difficult for students at this level. It is comparable to the 15% pass rate anchor item in that it asks for a specific definition/identification, but it is likely harder because "adjective phrase" is a more nuanced concept than simply differentiating between archaeological and literary sources. Given the common confusion between adjectives and adjective phrases, and the high difficulty of the "theme" question, I anticipate a very low pass rate.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 10%
