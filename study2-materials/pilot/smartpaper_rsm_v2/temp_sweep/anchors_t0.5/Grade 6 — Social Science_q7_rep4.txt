REASONING: This question requires recall of two specific facts (natural resources in Rajasthan) and then a basic explanation of influence, which is a slightly higher cognitive demand than simple recall but still accessible. It's harder than naming fundamental rights (66%) because it requires specific regional knowledge and a basic explanation, but easier than differentiating historical sources (15%) or finding a poem's theme (5%) which require deeper analytical skills. It's comparable to the "favorite season" question (30%) in requiring some specific details and a short explanation, but the facts here are less personal and more academic.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
