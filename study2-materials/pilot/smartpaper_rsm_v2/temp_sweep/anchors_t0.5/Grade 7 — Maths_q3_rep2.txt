REASONING: This question requires recalling a simple formula and performing basic multiplication, which is a core concept taught in Class 7 Mathematics. Compared to the English and Social Science questions, which often involve interpretation, recall of specific facts, or paragraph writing, this math problem is more direct and less ambiguous. The pass rates for the anchor items suggest that direct recall and application of learned formulas tend to have higher success rates than abstract interpretation or detailed factual recall.
