REASONING: This question requires students to recall basic science concepts related to decomposition and apply them to a real-world scenario. While the concept of decomposition is fundamental, articulating the "why" and "if beneficial" aspects might be challenging for some, similar to the "differentiate" or "theme" questions which require more than simple recall. However, it's less abstract than the poem theme and more directly related to their immediate environment than historical sources or constitutional rights. The "giving reasons" and "evaluating" parts elevate it beyond simple recall, making it harder than the 50% and 66% anchor items, but likely easier than the 5% and 15% anchors which demand more complex analytical or structured thinking.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
