REASONING: This question requires students to connect the story to their own understanding and provide a simple reason, similar to the "My favorite season" question which has a 30% pass rate. However, it's a "yes/no" question with a simple justification, making it slightly easier than the paragraph writing. It's harder than simply recalling facts (like the 50% and 66% anchors) because it demands a degree of critical thinking and personal connection.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
