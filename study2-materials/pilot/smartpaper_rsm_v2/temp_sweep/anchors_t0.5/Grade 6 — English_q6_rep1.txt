REASONING: This question is harder than the "Fundamental Rights" and "King's questions" anchors as it requires interpretation and personal connection, not just recall. However, it's easier than "The Last Bargain" theme and "Archaeological vs. Literary sources" as it doesn't demand abstract thematic understanding or factual differentiation, but rather a simple personal preference with a reason. It's also easier than the "Favorite Season" paragraph as it asks for a single line and a brief reason, not a multi-line paragraph with specific content requirements.
