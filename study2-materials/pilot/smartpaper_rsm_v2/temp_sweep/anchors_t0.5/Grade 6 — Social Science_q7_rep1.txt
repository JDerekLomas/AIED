REASONING: This question is harder than the 66% and 50% anchor items as it requires recall of specific geographical facts and an explanation, not just direct retrieval. It's comparable to the 30% anchor in terms of requiring recall and a short explanation, but it's about factual knowledge rather than personal experience. It's easier than the 5% and 15% anchors as the concepts are more concrete and less abstract.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
