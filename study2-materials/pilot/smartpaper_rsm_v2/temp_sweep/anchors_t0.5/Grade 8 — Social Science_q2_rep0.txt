REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "Fundamental Rights" question, as it asks for a specific factual recall from a well-covered topic in history. It's easier than the "Archaeological vs. Literary Sources" question because it only requires one feature and doesn't demand differentiation or examples.
