REASONING: This question is harder than the 50% pass rate item because it requires interpretation and explanation beyond direct recall. However, it's easier than the 5% pass rate item because it asks for a personal preference and justification, which is less abstract than identifying a central theme. It's similar in cognitive demand to the "My favorite season" question (30% pass rate) but requires engaging with the poem's text, which might be a slight hurdle.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
