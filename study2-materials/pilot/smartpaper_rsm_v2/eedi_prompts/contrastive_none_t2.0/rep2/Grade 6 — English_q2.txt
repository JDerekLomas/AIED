Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low prior knowledge demand related to specific facts/concepts:** The question itself doesn't require knowing historical facts, scientific principles, or complex math formulas. It's an *explicit information* retrieval question from a *story*.
    *   **Crucially, *the context of the story itself* is the absolute prerequisite.** If the students haven't read the story from which this question is drawn, they have *zero* chance of answering correctly. Given it's a stand-alone question without the story provided, this is a significant assumption.
    *   **Understanding of fictional narrative:** Assumes they can differentiate between characters, settings, and events in a story. This is generally within a Class 6 student's cognitive grasp, even in a weaker school system.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **"Who":** Very common interrogative pronoun, usually learned early. Low difficulty.
    *   **"lived":** Past tense of "live." Also very common verb. Low difficulty, even if they sometimes confuse it with "live" (present tense). The meaning will still be conveyed.
    *   **"inside":** Common preposition indicating location. Medium-low difficulty.
    *   **"the book":** "The" (definite article) and "book" (common noun). Very low difficulty.
    *   **Overall sentence structure:** Simple S-V-O-P structure ("Who lived inside the book?"). It's a direct question. Low complexity.
    *   **Expected answer ("a magical fairy", "fairy"):**
        *   "Magical": More complex adjective. Could be challenging for students with limited vocabulary if they don't explicitly recall it from the text or understand "magic."
        *   "Fairy": Common fantasy creature, often translated into Hindi/local languages as "pari." If the story introduced it, they might have a contextual understanding.
    *   **Issue of Recall vs. Generation:** The student doesn't have to *generate* the name of a character from scratch but *recall* it from a read text. However, recalling *specific adjectives* like "magical" can be harder than recalling the core noun "fairy."
    *   **Impact of *absence* of context:** Without the preceding story, the question is unanswerable, regardless of English proficiency. We *must assume the story was read and understood*.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is purely a **recall** question (explicit information retrieval). The answer should be directly stated in the story the students have presumably read. There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning required.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Within a text:** If asked immediately after reading a story, this would be considered a *very basic* comprehension question, perhaps one of the easiest "who/what/where" type questions.
    *   **Standalone:** As a standalone question (which is how it's presented here), its difficulty is *infinite* because the necessary information is missing. For a test, we *have to assume the context of the story has been provided to them earlier*.
    *   Assuming the story *was* provided, it's simpler than many inferential, vocabulary-building, or grammatical structure-focused exercises often found in Class 6 textbooks. Its simplicity lies in its directness.

**Summary of Strengths/Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:** Simple sentence structure, common words (except maybe "magical"). Pure recall, no complex reasoning.
*   **Weaknesses:** Absolute reliance on the student having read and *remembered* the specific story segment. The adjective "magical" might be forgotten/misunderstood if only "fairy" was the focus.

**Impact of Context:**

The average pass rate of 29% suggests that even 'easy' questions within context can be challenging due to reading comprehension issues, memory, or even basic test-taking skills. A *specific answer* is required, which leaves no room for approximation.

Let's assume the story *was* read recently as part of the exam content.

*   Many will understand "Who lived inside the book?"
*   They might recall "fairy" (pari) if it's a prominent character.
*   They might struggle to remember the descriptor "magical," or might not write it if the question is only looking for the primary character identification. The rubric explicitly accepts "fairy." This helps significantly.

Given the rubric's leniency ("Accept: 'a magical fairy',
