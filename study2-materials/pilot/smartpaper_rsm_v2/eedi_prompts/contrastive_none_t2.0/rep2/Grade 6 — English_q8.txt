Here's a breakdown of the question "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering the context:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **English Vocabulary:** All words (book, reading, a, is, he) are very basic and likely covered by Class 6, even for those with limited English. "Is" and "a" are fundamental grammatical words.
*   **Basic Sentence Structure (SVO):** This is the core skill being tested. Students are implicitly expected to know or deduce the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. In Hindi, while not strictly SVO, the core elements (कर्ता - कर्म - क्रिया, Karta - Karma - Kriya) exist and form logical sequences. A direct translation like "वह किताब पढ़ रहा है" (He book reading is) also follows a subject-object-verb order, so recognizing "he" as the doer, "book" as the object, and "reading" as the action is crucial. However, placing "is" and then "reading" (Verb + ing) together for the continuous tense is a specific English construction.
*   **Punctuation/Capitalization (Implicit):** While not explicitly graded, recognizing that a sentence starts with a capital letter (He) is usually part of understanding sentence structure.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**

*   **Low Vocabulary Demand:** As noted, all words are common.
*   **Grammar Overhaul (SVO vs. SOV):** This is the *biggest* challenge. Hindi is predominantly Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). English is SVO. Students need to internalize or apply the English SVO order.
    *   **Hindi example:** वह (He - S) किताब (book - O) पढ़ रहा है (reading is - V).
    *   **English required:** He (S) is reading (V) a book (O).
*   **Understanding "Rearrange... meaningful sentence":** While the phrase itself contains slightly more advanced words ("rearrange," "meaningful"), the concept is simple enough that many teachers would explain it, or students would deduce it from the task and examples. The task itself (shuffled words) gives a strong clue.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Application & Reasoning (primarily):** It's not pure recall of facts. It requires students to apply their knowledge of basic English grammar rules (SVO) and reason out the logical sequence of actions and objects. It's similar to solving a simple linguistic puzzle.
*   **Not pure recall:** You're not asking them to list parts of a sentence.
*   **Not highly complex reasoning:** The sentence is short and uses simple words, so the reasoning is fairly straightforward.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Mid-range difficulty for Class 6:**
    *   **Easier than:** Complex grammar exercises involving tenses, prepositions, or passive voice; comprehension passages; essay writing.
    *   **Similar to/Slightly harder than:** Simple fill-in-the-blanks or matching exercises.
    *   **Harder than:** Simple word-meaning matching, naming objects.
    *   **Typical in textbooks:** Rearranging jumbled words to form sentences is a common exercise found in Class 4, 5, and 6 English textbooks, precisely to reinforce SVO order. They would have encountered such exercises, although perhaps not always perfectly grasped.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Strengths (making it easier):** Very simple vocabulary, short sentence, common present continuous tense (likely introduced early). The concept of arranging words is fundamental.
*   **Weaknesses (making it harder):** The direct conflict with the native language (Hindi SOV vs. English SVO) is a significant hurdle. This isn't just knowing the words, but knowing how to sequence them in a new linguistic system. Many students might produce something like "He book is reading a" due to SOV interference, even if they know all the individual words. The "a" is also easy to misplace for an L1 Hindi speaker who might not have an equivalent indefinite article often.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29% across items):**

This average includes a wide range of questions, some undoubtedly much harder (comprehension, more complex grammar). This specific question tests a foundational grammatical skill. If the average pass rate for all English items is 29%, it implies a strong struggle across the board. However, basic sentence construction is often explicitly taught and drilled.

**Factors for this specific question:**
