Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, keeping their context in mind.

**Context:**
*   Class 7 students, mostly from economically weaker sections.
*   Many attend Hindi-medium schools with limited English proficiency.
*   Average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%. This suggests the exam is generally challenging for this group.

**Question:** Find the area of a triangle whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm.
**Rubric:** States or uses the correct formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. Max score: 1

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geometric Shapes:** Recognition of a triangle. This is very basic and almost universally known by Class 7.
    *   **Geometric Terminology:** Understanding "base" and "height" in the context of a triangle. This is explicitly taught in Class 6/7 when introducing areas of triangles and parallelograms. They might be familiar with the Hindi equivalents ("आधार" for base, "ऊँचाई" for height).
    *   **Units:** Understanding "cm" as a unit of length and "cm²" (implicitly, for area) as a unit of area.
    *   **Formula:** Knowing the formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. This is *the core* piece of knowledge required and would have been introduced and practiced in Class 6 or 7.
    *   **Basic Arithmetic:** Multiplication and division (especially by 2). This is standard for Class 7.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Key terms:** "Find the area," "triangle," "base," "height." These are fairly standard mathematical terms and are likely among the first English mathematical terms introduced, often alongside their Hindi counterparts.
    *   **Sentence structure:** Simple, direct command. "Find the area of..."
    *   **Clarity:** The values for base and height are directly given and clearly labelled.
    *   **Compared to other problems:** This problem is very low on linguistic complexity. There are no complex sentence structures, obscure vocabulary, or subtle meanings to decipher. The mathematical terms are primary.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of a memorized formula.
        *   **Recall:** Students need to recall the formula `Area = 1/2 × base × height`.
        *   **Application:** They then need to correctly substitute the given numerical values (`8` and `6`) into the formula and perform the calculation.
    *   It involves very minimal reasoning beyond understanding *which* formula to use. It doesn't require any derivation, interpretation of complex diagrams, or problem-solving strategies involving multiple steps or choices of formulas.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Very Easy/Direct:** This is a *template* or *introductory* problem. It's the most straightforward kind of problem encountered when learning the area of a triangle.
    *   **No distractions:** There are no extraneous numbers, no need to find the base or height from other information (like knowing the area and height, and finding the base).
    *   **Direct calculation:** The numbers chosen (`8` and `6`) are small and easy to work with, resulting in an integer answer (1/2 * 8 * 6 = 4 * 6 = 24), avoiding decimals or fractions in the final calculation, which can sometimes be stumbling blocks.
    *   **No units conversion:** Both measurements are in cm, so no conversion is required.

**Summary of Difficulty Factors:**

*   **Ease:**
    *   Very standard formula application.
    *   Directly given base and height.
    *   Simple, small numbers for calculation.
    *   Low linguistic demand.
    *   Commonly practiced problem type.
*   **Hardness:**
    *   The core difficulty lies in recalling the correct formula. If they don't know `1/2 * b * h`, they cannot solve it.
    *   Students with *very* weak arithmetic might make a multiplication error.
    *   Students might confuse it with the formula for the area of a rectangle (base * height) or a parallelogram.

Considering the "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%", this question should significantly outperform that average due to its directness and simplicity. The main barrier will be the recall of the specific formula. For students in Hindi-medium schools, the translation of "base"
