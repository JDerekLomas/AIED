Let's break down the question for an Indian Class 8 student in a government school, mostly from economically weaker sections, with Hindi-medium schooling and limited English proficiency.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct:** Students should have been taught about the Harappan Civilization as part of their history curriculum (usually Ancient Indian History). "Urban planning" might be a new term for some, but the underlying concepts (like "streets," "drains," "houses," "cities") would be familiar in Hindi. They would ideally have covered specific features of Harappan cities.
    *   **Implicit:** Understanding of basic concepts like "civilization," "cities," and "features" in a historical context. This is generally covered by Class 8.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   "Describe" - A common and generally understood instruction.
    *   "One key feature" - Straightforward. "Key feature" (प्रमुख विशेषता) would be recognized.
    *   "Harappan Civilization" - This proper noun is critical and would likely be learned as 'हड़प्पा सभ्यता'.
    *   "Urban planning" - This is the trickiest term. It might not be directly translated or explained in the exact phrase 'urban planning' in their textbooks. They might have learned "नगर नियोजन" or "शहरों की बनावट" or "शहरों की योजना." The English term might cause a stumble if not explicitly taught, but they could infer from "cities" (urban) and "making plans" (planning).
    *   **Overall:** The English is relatively simple given the core subject matter, but "urban planning" specifically could be a slight hurdle. However, the *rubric examples* are much more common phrases ("grid layout of streets," "advanced drainage system," "use of baked bricks," "citadel and lower town"). These are the common descriptions they would have learned.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily a **recall** question. Students are expected to have memorized features of the Harappan civilization from their history lessons. There's no complex application or reasoning required beyond remembering what they've been taught.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question format ("Describe one feature...") is very common in Indian school exams and textbooks for history.
    *   The content (Harappan Civilization) is fundamental for this age group.
    *   The required answer (one feature) is quite basic and easily obtainable if they have studied the chapter. Textbook exercises often ask for 2-3 features or short notes, so asking for *one* is relatively easy.

**Factors for the Estimate:**

*   **Core Curriculum:** Harappan Civilization is a foundational topic for Class 8 History. They *should* have covered it extensively.
*   **Recall-Based:** No complex analytical skills are needed. If they studied, they can recall.
*   **Rubric's Breadth:** The rubric is very generous, accepting multiple correct answers. This significantly increases the chances of a correct answer. Many students might recall the drainage system, some the baked bricks, others the town planning, or the citadel concept.
*   **English Language Barrier (Minor):** While "urban planning" could be tricky, the common historical facts associated with it (e.g., "naliyaan," "pucci eentain," "sarkon ka naksha") are highly recognizable even if they struggle with the exact phrase. Their mental recall would likely go straight to those well-known features.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections/Govt Schools:** These students might have less exposure to academic English, but their history lessons in Hindi would contain the information. Rote learning is common, so direct recall of specific features in Hindi would translate easily if they grasp the essence of the question.
*   **Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is for *all* items. This question, being foundational recall in history, should perform better than average, especially compared to items requiring more complex reasoning or application across subjects.

Given that Harappan Civilization is a central topic, students are likely to have *some* familiarity. The flexibility of the rubric accepting any of the prominent features (which are distinct and memorable) will allow many to get this correct even if their overall English is weak. They would associate "Harappan" with these specific terms.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40-50%**

My reasoning leans towards the higher end of this range because:
1.  It's pure recall of a fundamental topic.
2.  The question only asks for *one* feature, and several very distinct ones are widely taught.
3.  Even if the English phrase "urban planning" is not perfectly understood, the
