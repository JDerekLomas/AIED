Let's break down the question for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, keeping their profile in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Baseline:** Students at Class 8 would likely have covered the advent of European trading companies, the East India Company, and major historical events leading up to the British Raj in their Social Science (History) curriculum. The Battle of Plassey (1757) is a cornerstone event and would undoubtedly be in their textbook. They should know the general timeframe and the participants (British EIC vs. Nawab of Bengal).
    *   **Specific:** They would be expected to know the *immediate outcome* of the battle: British victory, dethronement of Siraj-ud-Daulah, and the installation of a puppet ruler (Mir Jafar).
    *   **Implicit:** The question requires them to understand the *concept* of "expansion of power." This isn't just a factual recall but requires connecting the outcome of the battle to a broader political consequence.

*   **Language Demands (English Medium):**
    *   **Keywords:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "British power," "India." These are very specific and identifiable historical terms, often transliterated or directly used even in Hindi-medium texts.
    *   **Action Verbs/Concepts:** "Contribute," "expansion."
        *   "Contribute": This implies cause and effect, not just a description. Students need to explain *how* it helped, not just *what* happened. This is a moderate demand.
        *   "Expansion": This is a core concept related to colonial history. It generally means increase or spread. For a student with limited English, they might recognize "expand" or "growth."
    *   **Overall Sentence Structure:** The sentence is straightforward (How X contributed to Y?). There isn't complex grammar or jargon beyond the historical terms.
    *   **Rubric Match:** The rubric uses "establishment of British political dominance/control," "puppet nawab." These are key concepts that align well with typical textbook explanations of Plassey's significance.

*   **Is this Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Primary:** It is primarily **Recall and Explanatory Recall**. Students need to recall the direct consequences of the Battle of Plassey and explain how these consequences led to the "expansion of British power."
    *   **Slight Reasoning/Understanding:** It moves slightly beyond pure recall because they need to connect the dots between the specific outcome (Mir Jafar, revenue rights) and the broader concept of "expansion of British power." They are not just stating "British won" but *explaining the significance of that victory*. The phrasing "How did X contribute..." moves it past simple recall.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Textbook Level:** This question is **highly typical** of end-of-chapter questions or short-answer questions for a Class 8 History chapter on the Battle of Plassey and early British expansion. Textbooks commonly ask "Explain the significance of the Battle of Plassey" or "How did the Battle of Plassey lay the foundation for British rule?"
    *   **Compared to other Social Science:** Social Science at this level often includes maps, definitions, simple timelines, and factual recall. This question, requiring an explanation of *causality* rather than just *event*, places it slightly above a basic "who/what/when" but is well within the expected analytical depth.
    *   **Specific content difficulty:** Plassey's role as the *first major political foothold* for the British, granting control over Bengal's vast resources and revenues, is generally very clearly articulated in Indian history textbooks. It's often presented as the turning point from a trading company to a political power.

**Synthesis of Factors for Success:**

*   **High Familiarity of Content:** The Battle of Plassey is a critical, frequently taught event.
*   **Moderate Language Demand:** Keywords are well-known historical terms. "Contribute" and "expansion" are common enough in academic contexts to be decipherable or inferred, especially if students are prepared for social science questions in English.
*   **Requires Explanation, not just Facts:** This is the primary hurdle. Students can recall facts but struggle to explain their significance. However, the *significance* of Plassey (political control of Bengal, revenue, puppet ruler) is also very well-defined and taught as a direct consequence.
*   **Direct Alignment with Curriculum:** This is a core concept.

Given that the average pass rate across items is 29%, we need to consider why this might be higher or lower for this specific question.

*   It's **higher** than average
