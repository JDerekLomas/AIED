Let's break down the question for Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Implicitly:** Access to and understanding of the poem itself. This is the biggest hurdle. If they haven't read or understood the poem (which isn't provided), the question is impossible. *Assuming* the poem has been presented to them in a way they can access (e.g., read aloud, provided in their medium), then:
    *   **Explicitly:** Basic reading comprehension in English to identify "line from the poem."
    *   **Conceptual:** Understanding of "like" and "most," and the ability to articulate "why." This requires a degree of self-reflection and personal expression, which might be less emphasized in rote learning environments.
    *   **Grammatical:** The ability to form a simple sentence expressing a preference and a reason.

2.  **Language Demands (with Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Line," "poem," "like," "most," "why." These are generally high-frequency words, but "poem" specifically might be less common than "story" or "lesson." "Most" in this comparative sense is key.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" This is an interrogative sentence with two parts ("which line...most" and "why").
        *   "Which line...most": Fairly direct.
        *   "and why?": Crucial and often challenging for non-native speakers to fully address in their response, beyond just restating the choice.
    *   **Expressive Language:** The "why" part is where the main language demand lies. Students need to construct a sentence or two explaining their preference. This goes beyond simple recall or identification. They need to generate original thought in English.
    *   **Medium:** If the poem itself is in English, that's another layer of challenge. If the poem is in Hindi and this question is given, it's still about *responding* in English.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily a **reasoning** and **application** question.
        *   **Application:** Students must apply their understanding of "liking" to specific lines of the poem.
        *   **Reasoning:** The "why" demands reasoning and justification. It's not recall, as there's no single "correct" line. It's not simple identification. It requires higher-order thinking to articulate personal preference.
        *   **Partial Recall/Identification:** Identifying a "line from the poem" involves recall (of the poem's content) or identification (if the poem is presented in front of them).

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical exercises often focus on:**
        *   Direct factual recall (e.g., "Who went to the market?").
        *   Simple identification (e.g., "Point to the verb in this sentence.").
        *   Multiple choice questions, where options guide the student.
        *   Filling in the blanks using words from a word bank.
    *   **This question is more difficult because:**
        *   It's **open-ended**. There's no single correct answer for "which line," only for the structure of the answer.
        *   It demands **personal expression** and **justification** in English, which is often not heavily practiced. Students might struggle to translate their reasons from their native language into English, even if the reason itself is simple (e.g., "it made me happy," "it was funny").
        *   The **subjectivity** can be confusing in an educational system that often rewards single, correct answers. Some students might be hesitant to state a personal preference, fearing it's "wrong."
        *   The *why* is the hardest part. Many students, even with good English, might simply repeat the line and offer a vague or no reason.

**Specific Challenges for This Demographic:**

*   **Comprehension of the Poem:** If the poem itself is in English, its vocabulary, metaphors, and rhythm will pose a significant barrier, making the entire premise difficult. Even if translated, understanding *nuances* of lines might be hard.
*   **Vocabulary of "Why":** Students might have "good/bad" as the extent of their expressive vocabulary. Articulating a deeper reason (e.g., "It makes me think of my village," "It gives me hope") is difficult in limited English.
*   **Fear of Incorrectness:** Given a system often focused on right/wrong answers, expressing a personal opinion can feel risky or unusual
