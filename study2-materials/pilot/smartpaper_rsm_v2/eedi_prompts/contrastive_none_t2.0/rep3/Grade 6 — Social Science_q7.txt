Let's break down the question for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, keeping their likely profile in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis of the Specific Question:**

*   **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Geography of India/Rajasthan:** Basic awareness that Rajasthan is a state and generally dry/sandy. This is likely covered in Class 5/6 Social Science (Our India, Our States).
    *   **Definition of Natural Resources:** Understanding what "natural resources" are (things from nature that are useful to humans). This would be a core concept in an early chapter on resources.
    *   **Basic Understanding of Influence/Impact:** How resources can affect human lives.
    *   **Specific Resources of Rajasthan:** Knowledge of at least *two* resources specifically found in Rajasthan. This is where the difficulty can spike. While marble, copper, gypsum are characteristic, other states also have them. Water is universally present but its *scarcity* is more defining for Rajasthan. Sand/Sunlight are very obvious but might not immediately be recognized as "resources" by all students, or specifically *natural* resources.

*   **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   "Mention": Straightforward.
    *   "Natural resources": Likely introduced as a vocabulary term, but context is key. If the local language equivalent is strongly used, the English term might be weaker.
    *   "Found in Rajasthan": Specific geographical context.
    *   "Explain": Requires more than just listing; they need to form a coherent sentence or two describing the influence. This is a higher-order demand than simple recall.
    *   "Influences the lives of the people there": Phrasing is relatively common, but understanding "influences" (prabhavit karna) might be a challenge if not explicitly taught with examples.
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary isn't excessively complex, but the combination of "explain" and "influences" pushes it beyond simple recall, requiring stronger sentence construction than students with limited English might possess consistently.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Listing resources:** Primarily recall (of facts about Rajasthan).
    *   **Explaining influence:** Application and some basic reasoning. Students need to connect a resource (e.g., water) to a daily life activity (agriculture, drinking, scarcity leading to difficult life). This isn't abstract reasoning but rather connecting cause and effect from common observations or learned facts.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Part 1 (Listing):** "Name two resources found in Rajasthan" would be a common recall question, often appearing as "Fill in the blanks" or "Short answer."
    *   **Part 2 (Explaining Influence):** This adds a layer of complexity. Textbook exercises often have simpler "How is [resource] useful?" questions. "Explaining influence on *lives*" is more demanding, requiring a slightly longer, more descriptive answer than a one-word or short phrase. It's more aligned with "Describe" type questions, which are typically harder than "List" or "Name."
    *   The "Max score: 1" for mentioning two resources and *explaining* one seems low for the amount of work, which might confuse students who typically get partial credit for partial answers. The rubric is lenient if only two resources grant 1 mark, but if both resources *and* explanation are needed for 1 mark, it's harder. Assuming the rubric *means* 1 mark if *all* conditions are met (two resources AND explanation), this increases difficulty for achieving full score. *If only the mention of two resources grants 1 mark*, the difficulty significantly drops. Given the phrasing of the prompt, I will assume it means "1 point if they correctly answer *both parts of the question adequately*".

**Analysis of the Students and Average Pass Rate (29%):**

*   Economically weaker sections: Likely less exposure to varied learning resources, potentially larger class sizes, less individual attention.
*   Hindi-medium with limited English: This is a major hurdle. Even if they know the facts in Hindi, articulating them accurately in English is tough. They might misinterpret "influences" or struggle to form grammatically correct sentences for the "explain" part.
*   Average pass rate of 29% for *across items* implies that questions are generally challenging, or students perform poorly overall. A question that requires *both* factual recall *and* basic explanation/reasoning in a non-native language is likely to be harder than the average "recall" item.

**Specific Difficulties with This Question:**

1.  **Recall of Specific Resources for Rajasthan:** While general resources are known, linking *
