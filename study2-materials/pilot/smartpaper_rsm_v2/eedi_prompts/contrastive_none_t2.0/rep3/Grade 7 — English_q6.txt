Let's break down this question for Class 7 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections, typically with limited English proficiency.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Implicit understanding of "writing style":** While the term itself might be new or not frequently used in their English curriculum, students in Class 7 would have encountered various texts and perhaps implicitly understood that different authors write differently. However, explicitly labeling it as "writing style" and then finding a *descriptive word* for it requires a more mature understanding of literary analysis than typically expected.
*   **Vocabulary to describe writing style:** This is the core challenge. Students need to not only understand "writing style" but also have a bank of adjectives (simple, descriptive, informal, direct, poetic, formal, engaging, humorous, etc.) to apply. Their standard English vocabulary in these settings is usually more functional and concrete.
*   **Experience analyzing texts (even in their native language):** To even attempt to describe a style, they would need some experience, even rudimentary, with analyzing the *way* something is written, not just *what* it says. This level of literary analysis is generally introduced later or is not a strong focus in primary/middle school English in these environments.
*   **Prior exposure to poetry and its elements:** The question refers to "the poet's writing style." This implies they have *just read a poem*. Their ability to answer this will also depend on the complexity of that poem. However, even if the poem was simple, the *meta-analysis* of its style is harder.

**Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**

*   **"Describes":** This is a fairly common verb and likely understood.
*   **"Poet's":** Common word, possessive apostrophe is usually understood.
*   **"Writing style":** This is the key lexical item and a **major hurdle**. "Style" as a standalone word (e.g., in fashion) might be known, but "writing style" as a literary concept is highly unlikely to be part of their active or even passive vocabulary. It's an abstract noun referring to an attribute of writing, not a concrete object or action.
*   **Difficulty with forming a descriptive answer in English:** Even if they vaguely understood what was being asked, generating a *suitable English adjective* (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct) that precisely conveys their thought is a significant challenge. Their typical English output at this stage is usually single words, short phrases, or simple sentences for concrete information.

**Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

This is primarily **application** of a critical analysis skill, coupled with **reasoning** and a strong demand for **vocabulary production**.
1.  **Read and comprehend the poem** (input for reasoning).
2.  **Understand the abstract concept of "writing style"** (key conceptual hurdle).
3.  **Analyze the poem specifically for its stylistic attributes** (application/reasoning).
4.  **Recall/select an appropriate English adjective to describe that style** (vocabulary production/recall).

This is much more demanding than simple recall or direct comprehension.

**How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

This question is **significantly harder** than typical Class 7 English textbook exercises in these schools.

Typical exercises often focus on:
*   **Vocabulary recall:** Matching words, fill in the blanks, opposites.
*   **Grammar:** Identifying parts of speech, simple sentence structure, tense usage.
*   **Reading comprehension:** Answering direct questions about facts explicitly stated in a passage (who, what, when, where).
*   **Simple sentence construction.**
*   **Recalling events or characters.**

Literary analysis requiring abstract conceptual understanding ("writing style") and the generation of appropriate descriptive adjectives is usually not introduced formally until much later, or only superficially with guided options, in such curricula. The concept itself is alien, and the demand for a specific descriptive word is too high.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Vocabulary:** "Writing style" is the biggest blocker.
*   **Concept:** Abstract literary analysis is a significant step up from their usual learning.
*   **Skill:** Requires analytical reasoning and productive vocabulary generation, not just recall or basic comprehension.
*   **Rubric:** The rubric expects a *specific adjective* which is a high bar for their productive English.

Given an average pass rate of 29% across *all items*, this question, with its heavy reliance on an unknown abstract concept and the need for sophisticated vocabulary, would be considerably harder than many average items.

Some students might guess, or recall a simple word like "good" or "nice" which wouldn't align with the rubric. Only a very small fraction would likely grasp the intent and have the vocabulary to respond
