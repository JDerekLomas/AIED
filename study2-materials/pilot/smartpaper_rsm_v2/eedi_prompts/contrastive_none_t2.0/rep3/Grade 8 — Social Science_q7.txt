Let's break down the question for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, keeping their specific context in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Directly relevant:** Students are expected to have studied Indian history, specifically the period of colonial expansion. The Battle of Plassey (1757) is a landmark event covered in Class 8 history textbooks (often in chapters on "From Trade to Territory" or "Establishment of British Rule"). They should know *what* the Battle of Plassey was, *when* it happened, and *who* the main players were (British East India Company, Nawab of Bengal).
    *   **Underlying concepts:** They need to understand what "expansion of power" means in a historical context (territorial control, political influence, economic dominance). They also need to understand the concept of a "puppet ruler" or "client state" to grasp the impact on Bengal's political autonomy. This might be taught explicitly or inferred.
    *   **Overall:** The assumed prior knowledge is directly aligned with the Class 8 history syllabus. This is a standard, important topic.

2.  **Language Demands (English):**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Contribute": Relatively common word, should be understandable.
        *   "Expansion": Also common in a historical context, should be understood.
        *   "British power": Clear.
        *   "Dominance/Control": These are key rubric terms. "Control" is a very basic word. "Dominance" is slightly more sophisticated but likely encountered in this context.
        *   "Puppet nawab": This is crucial for the full answer. "Puppet" as an adjective for a ruler is more advanced and metaphorical. While "Mir Jafar" might be mentioned, the concept of him being a "puppet" ruler controlled by the British is a higher-level understanding of the political consequence. Students who only know *that* Mir Jafar became nawab, but not *why* or *what it meant*, might struggle here.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** "How did X contribute to Y?" is a fairly straightforward question structure. It asks for a cause-and-effect explanation.
    *   **Impact of limited English:** The core concept can be expressed with relatively simple English (e.g., "British won, controlled Bengal, made new nawab their friend"). However, explicitly using terms like "political dominance" or understanding the nuanced meaning of "puppet nawab" might be challenging for students with very limited English proficiency who just recall facts. They might know the *fact* but struggle to *articulate* the *consequence* effectively in English.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Mostly Recall:** The question primarily asks for recall of a historical cause-and-effect relationship that is explicitly taught in textbooks. Students are expected to remember *what happened after* the Battle of Plassey and *how that event linked to British power*.
    *   **Implicit Reasoning (for full score):** To get the full score by mentioning "political dominance/control over Bengal" and especially the "puppet nawab" aspect, it moves slightly beyond pure rote recall into a basic level of *understanding* and *synthesizing* the historical consequence. It requires recalling not just "Mir Jafar became nawab" but *what that appointment signified* in terms of British control. This is a very common analytical expectation in Class 8 history.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is a **standard, medium-difficulty question** that directly addresses a key learning objective for the chapter on colonial expansion.
    *   Textbook exercises frequently ask similar questions like: "Explain the significance of the Battle of Plassey," "How did the British establish control over Bengal?", or "What were the consequences of the Battle of Plassey?"
    *   It's not a higher-order critical thinking question (like analyzing counterfactuals or comparing long-term impacts), but it requires more than just recalling a date or a name. It asks for a clear explanation of *impact*.
    *   The challenge for many Class 8 government school students would be the combination of:
        *   Accurately recalling the *consequences* (not just the event).
        *   Expressing those consequences clearly in English, even if their comprehension is primarily in Hindi. The rubric's specific demand ("political dominance/control" and "puppet nawab") pushes the language a bit.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%**

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Average Pass Rate (29%):** Our estimate should hover around this baseline, considering it's an "average"
