Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the question: "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he"

**Contrastive Analysis**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Word Recognition:** Students must recognize and understand the basic meaning of each individual word: "book," "reading," "a," "is," "he." These are very common, high-frequency words typically introduced in early English lessons (even kindergarten/Grade 1 in many curricula).
    *   **Basic Sentence Structure (SVO):** Implicitly, students need to understand that English sentences typically follow a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern. While they might not articulate it as SVO, they should have an intuitive grasp that "who is doing what" usually comes first, followed by the action, and then what the action is done to. This concept is foundational and would be covered extensively by Class 6, even in a basic English curriculum.
    *   **Concept of a "meaningful sentence":** Understanding that words need to be put together logically to convey a complete thought.

2.  **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely basic and high-frequency. They are highly likely to be part of the active or passive vocabulary of a Class 6 student, even with limited exposure to English. "He," "is," "a," "book" are among the first words learned. "Reading" is also very common.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** The grammatical structure required for the correct answer ("He is reading a book") is very simple present continuous. This is a core tense introduced early in English language learning. The jumbled words represent a very common simple sentence structure. The absence of complex prepositions, phrasal verbs, or less common grammatical constructions makes it accessible.
    *   **Reading/Processing Load:** The task involves unscrambling only five very short words. The cognitive load is low in terms of the number of words to process.
    *   **Ambiguity:** There is very little to no ambiguity. The only logical arrangement creates a singular, common, meaningful sentence.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application (primarily) and Reasoning (secondary):** It's not pure recall, as the students aren't just memorizing a phrase. It requires applying their knowledge of English vocabulary and basic sentence structure rules (SVO) to rearrange the given words. There's an element of reasoning as they must figure out the *logical* order that makes sense.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easier to Moderate (on the easier side):** This exercise is *very* common in Class 1-4 English textbooks, often under topics like "Sentence Formation" or "Jumbled Words." By Class 6, students would have encountered and practiced many such exercises. Often, Class 6 textbook exercises might involve slightly longer sentences, more complex vocabulary, or require choosing from a larger set of jumbled words. This specific question is relatively straightforward even compared to *entry-level* Class 6 English.
    *   It aligns with the very foundational elements of sentence formation in English.

**Factors making it EASY:**
*   **Extremely basic, high-frequency vocabulary:** Words like "he," "is," "a," "book," "reading" are core to early English learning.
*   **Simple grammatical structure (SVO, present continuous):** One of the first tenses and sentence structures taught.
*   **Few words:** Only five words to arrange, limiting the cognitive load.
*   **No real alternative meaningful sentences:** The only logical arrangement produces the target sentence.
*   **Very common exercise type:** Students will have ample exposure to "rearrange the words" questions.

**Factors making it HARD (or potential pitfalls for the target group):**
*   **Lack of exposure to English altogether:** For students with truly minimal or no prior English, even these simple words would be new. However, by Class 6 in government schools, some English instruction (even if basic) is generally mandatory.
*   **Weak understanding of "meaningful sentence":** Students who just randomly order words might struggle.
*   **Limited practice with sentence structure:** If their English curriculum has focused heavily on rote memorization without sufficient practical application, this could be harder.
*   **Hindi influence (S-O-V structure):** Hindi typically follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure. While they are translating into English and trying to form an English sentence, for a few students, this underlying influence *might* lead to a less intuitive SVO construction initially, but common drills on SVO sentences would usually overcome this for simple
