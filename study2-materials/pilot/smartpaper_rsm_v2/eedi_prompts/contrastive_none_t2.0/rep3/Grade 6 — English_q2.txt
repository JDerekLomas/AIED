Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct:** The student needs to have read a specific passage/story from which this question is drawn. Without the context of the book/story, this question is unanswerable.
    *   **Indirect:** Basic comprehension skills, the ability to extract a specific piece of information from a text (character identification). The concept of characters living "inside" a book or story is generally understood by this age group.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Who": Very common, likely understood.
        *   "lived": Very common verb, past tense of "live", likely understood.
        *   "inside": Common preposition, likely understood.
        *   "the book": Very common noun phrase, almost certainly understood.
        *   **Rubric-specific words (if students use them):** "magical" (somewhat less common but generally recognizable), "fairy" (quite common due to cartoons, stories).
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple "Who did X?" structure. This is a very straightforward question form.
    *   **Overall:** The English demands are quite low for an English question. The core words are high-frequency, and the sentence structure is simple. This makes it significantly easier than many other English questions that might involve more complex vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, or convoluted sentence structures.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is almost purely **recall**. If the student has read the passage and understood it, the answer ("a magical fairy") is explicitly stated in the text. There's no need for application of concepts or complex reasoning, inferring, or synthesizing information. It's a direct information retrieval task.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very *typical* comprehension question for Class 6. It's on the easier end of comprehension questions found in textbooks, often falling into the "identify characters" category.
    *   It is much simpler than questions requiring:
        *   Summarization
        *   Analysis of character motivation
        *   Prediction of outcomes
        *   Understanding themes
        *   Making inferences from non-explicitly stated information.

**Factors making it EASY:**
*   Very simple English vocabulary and sentence structure.
*   Direct recall question, requiring no complex reasoning or application.
*   The concept of a "fairy" is widely understood through popular culture even for those with limited formal English.

**Factors making it HARD:**
*   **Crucially dependent on prior reading of the specific passage.** If the students have not read the accompanying text, they cannot answer it, regardless of their English proficiency. This is the biggest hurdle.
*   The "average pass rate of 29% across items" suggests that even "easy" items will face a significant barrier due to foundational learning gaps and English exposure.

**Synthesizing the Difficulty:**

Assuming the students *have read and understood the associated text* in the exam, this question is relatively easy from a language and cognitive demand perspective. The biggest challenge, outside of direct passage comprehension, would be the overall low proficiency levels affecting even simple vocabulary recognition. However, the familiarity of words like "who," "lived," "inside," "book," and "fairy" mitigates this significantly.

Given the 29% average pass rate across items, which encompasses a range of difficulties, this particular question is simpler than many. The potential for missing the specific passage content is a major confounding factor, but for *those who comprehended the story*, it's a very straightforward recall. The average pass rate hints at issues *beyond* just the question difficulty itself, pointing to overall preparedness and comprehension.

**Considering "those who comprehended the story":** For the segment of students who understood the story, this question should have a very high success rate. However, the "average pass rate across items is about 29%" suggests that a large proportion of students likely struggle with the core passage comprehension itself.

Let's imagine the funnel:
1.  **Read and understand the story enough to know *what* lived inside the book.** This is the biggest hurdle, suggested by the overall pass rate. Let's assume roughly 40-50% might be able to extract this key fact if prompted directly about the story's main elements.
2.  **Understand the question "Who lived inside the book?"** As established, the English for this question is quite simple, so a large majority of students who successfully completed step 1 would also complete step 2.
3.  **Formulate the answer
