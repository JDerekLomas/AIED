Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the specified context.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Time:**
    *   Understanding of "am" and "pm".
    *   Ability to calculate elapsed time, crossing the noon boundary. This is a common Class 4-5 topic, reinforced in Class 6.
    *   Basic clock reading/understanding of hours.
*   **Arithmetic:**
    *   Addition.
    *   Multiplication (implicitly, repeated addition).
*   **Context:**
    *   Understanding "temperature," "increases," "per hour."
    *   Basic understanding of degrees Celsius.

**Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**

This is where the major hurdle lies.

*   "At 10 am in the morning..." - Fairly straightforward.
*   "...temperature of Jodhpur was 30°C." - "Temperature" might be a new word for some, but "degree C" is universally understood as related to hot/cold.
*   "If the temperature **increases** by 2°C **per hour**..." - "Increases" and "per hour" are critical. "Increases" could be inferred from context if "2°C" is understood as adding, but "per hour" specifies the rate. This is where multiplication comes in.
*   "...then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?" - "Evening" confirms "pm". "What will be the temperature" implies calculation of the final state.

**Key Vocabulary Challenges:**
*   "Temperature" (might be known in Hindi/local language but needs to be mapped to English).
*   "Increases"
*   "Per hour"
*   "Evening" (as opposed to "night," confirming "pm")

**Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

This is an **application** problem with elements of **reasoning**.
*   **Application:** Students need to apply their knowledge of time calculation, addition, and multiplication to a real-world scenario.
*   **Reasoning:** The main reasoning step is realizing that "per hour" implies multiplication of the rate by the number of hours. They also need to correctly reason about how to calculate the total elapsed time, particularly across noon.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Difficulty Level:** This question is likely slightly harder than a typical *basic* Class 6 arithmetic exercise due to the multi-step nature and the integrated concept of time and rate. However, similar "word problems" involving money, distance, or other rates are common in Class 6 textbooks.
*   **Real-world Context:** The "Jodhpur," "temperature" context makes it relatable but also slightly more verbose than pure number problems.
*   **Hidden steps:** The key difficulty is that it's not explicitly "add 2 six times" or "multiply 2 by 6." The '6' needs to be calculated first. Many textbook problems might simplify this by stating "after 6 hours."
*   **Language Barrier:** Typical textbook examples are often accompanied by diagrams or are taught in the local language, making the English phrasing a more significant hurdle here.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Ease Factors:**
    *   The numbers are simple (2, 30, 10, 4).
    *   The core operations (addition, multiplication) are Class 6 level.
    *   The "per hour" structure is a common pattern in rate problems.
    *   The topic of "temperature change" is familiar in general terms.
*   **Difficulty Factors:**
    *   **Crucial Language Demands:** "Increases," "per hour" are high-impact words. Misinterpreting these leads to failure.
    *   **Time Calculation (10 am to 4 pm):** This is a two-part calculation (10-12, then 12-4). Errors are common, e.g., students might just do 4-10 = -6 or 10-4=6, getting lucky, or simply subtract numbers directly without understanding time. Correctly identifying 6 hours is key.
    *   **Multi-step Problem:** Students need to perform two main steps (calculate time, then calculate temperature increase, then final temperature), which is often challenging for lower-performing students.
    *   **No Diagrams:** The problem relies solely on text.

**Likely Errors:**

1.  **Time Calculation Error:** Most common. Calculating the elapsed time incorrectly (e.g., 4 hours, 2 hours, 7 hours).
2.  **Language Misinterpretation:** Not understanding "increases"
