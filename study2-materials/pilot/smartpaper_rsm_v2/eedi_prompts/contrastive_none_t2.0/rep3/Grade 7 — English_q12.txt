Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, keeping their profile in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of Voice (Active/Passive):** This is the core grammatical concept being tested. While it is generally introduced around Class 6 or 7, its understanding can be superficial in many students, especially if teaching focuses on rote memorization rather than conceptual grasp. They need to understand what 'subject' and 'object' are in a sentence.
    *   **Verb Forms (specifically Past Participle):** This is crucial. Students need to know the past participle of "blow," which is "blown." Irregular verbs are a consistent challenge for non-native English speakers. Many might know "blow" and "blew" but stumble on "blown."
    *   **Preposition "by":** Understanding its use to introduce the agent in a passive sentence.
    *   **Auxiliary verb "be" (appropriate tense):** They need to choose "were" (past tense of 'be' matching 'leaves' and the original past tense 'blew'). This involves understanding subject-verb agreement and tense consistency.

*   **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are all fairly common, concrete words. No particularly complex vocabulary.
    *   **Instructional Language:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" is standard grammatical instruction. If they've been taught the concept, they should recognize these terms. However, understanding the nuance of "active" and "passive" conceptually in English (beyond just a transformation rule) might be limited.
    *   **Syntax of transformation:** This is where it gets complex. They have to:
        1.  Identify the object ("the leaves").
        2.  Make it the new subject.
        3.  Identify the tense of the original verb ("blew" - past simple).
        4.  Choose the correct form of "be" in that tense ("were" because "leaves" is plural).
        5.  Convert the main verb to its past participle form ("blown").
        6.  Add "by" and the original subject ("by the wind").
    *   **Irregular Verb "blow-blew-blown":** This is a *major* hurdle. Regular verbs like "played," "washed," "walked" are easier because the past participle is often the same as the past tense. Irregular verbs like "blow," "write," "see," "drink" are very common in Class 7, but mastery is often inconsistent. Many might incorrectly write "leaved were blew" or "leaves were blowed."

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   Predominantly **Application** of learned rules. It requires applying a multi-step transformation process, not just recalling a definition.
    *   Some **Recall** of the past participle form of "blow."

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very *typical* Class 7 exercise for Active/Passive Voice. It's not overly complex in sentence structure or vocabulary, which are often varied in textbooks.
    *   The primary challenge, as noted, is the irregular verb. If the sentence had been "She wrote a letter," the same challenge regarding "written" would arise. If it was "The boy kicked the ball," it would be considerably easier ("The ball was kicked by the boy") because "kicked" is a regular verb. Therefore, this question sits on the slightly harder side of "typical" because of the irregular verb form.

**Likely Errors:**

1.  **Incorrect Past Participle:** "The leaves were *blew* away by the wind." or "The leaves were *blowed* away by the wind." (Most common error).
2.  **Incorrect Auxiliary Verb "be":** "The leaves *was* blown away by the wind." (Subject-verb agreement error).
3.  **Missing "by the wind":** "The leaves were blown away." (Grammatically passive, but incomplete according to the rubric's expectation of a full transformation). However, sometimes textbooks accept this as long as the object/verb transformation is correct. Given the rubric, omitting it would likely result in 0 or partial credit.
4.  **Incorrect word order:** "The leaves were away blown by the wind."

Given the "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%," and considering the specific challenges, especially with the irregular verb and the multi-step transformation, I'd expect this question to be slightly harder than the average *if* the average includes a lot of
