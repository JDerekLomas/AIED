Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school.

**Question:** At `10` am in the morning, the temperature of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`. If the temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour, then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Time Measurement:** Understanding "am" and "pm", and how to calculate time elapsed over a period that crosses noon (e.g., 10 am to 4 pm). This is foundational and covered in Class 3-5.
    *   **Arithmetic:** Basic addition and multiplication. This is very standard.
    *   **Temperature Units:** Understanding `^0 C` as degrees Celsius and what temperature means conceptually. This is also standard for their grade level.
    *   **Rate of Change (Implicit):** Understanding "per hour" means multiplying the change per hour by the number of hours. This is an application of multiplication and could be tricky for some, but it's not truly algebraic rate of change.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   "At 10 am in the morning": Relatively simple, "morning" clarifies "am".
    *   "temperature of Jodhpur was 30^0 C": Straightforward.
    *   "If the temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour": "Increases by" and "per hour" are key. "Increases" is generally understood as addition. "Per hour" needs to be understood as applying for each unit of hour.
    *   "then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?": "What will be" (future tense, implies calculation) and "evening" (clarifies "pm").
    *   **Overall:** The English is quite direct and lacks complex grammatical structures or obscure vocabulary. The core words are common for math problems. The challenge comes more from the numerical reasoning embedded in the language.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application:** It's primarily an application problem. Students need to apply their knowledge of time calculation, multiplication, and addition to a real-world scenario.
    *   **Reasoning:** There's a slight element of reasoning required to break the problem down into steps (calculate hours, calculate total increase, add to initial temperature). It's not a multi-step logical deduction, but sequential application.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Complexity:** This problem is slightly more complex than a direct single-step calculation. It requires:
        1.  Calculating the time difference (10 am to 4 pm). This is often a separate type of exercise.
        2.  Calculating the total temperature increase.
        3.  Adding the increase to the initial temperature.
    *   **Multi-step:** Indian textbooks do feature multi-step problems by Class 6, but combining time calculations with rate problems can be a slightly higher cognitive load than, say, a two-step money problem.
    *   **Real-world Context:** The "Jodhpur" and "temperature" context is common and usually helps engagement.

**Difficulty Points:**

1.  **Time Calculation:** The biggest hurdle is likely accurately calculating the hours between 10 am and 4 pm. Students might miscount or struggle with crossing noon if their conceptual understanding of 12-hour clock (or 24-hour clock for mental calculation) isn't robust.
    *   Common errors:
        *   Counting 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 = 7 hours (starting at 10)
        *   12-10 = 2, then 4+2 = 6 hours (correct for am-pm shift calculation)
        *   Using subtraction if they confuse 4 pm with 16:00 and then subtract 10, etc.
    *   If they get 5 hours, their total would be 30 + (2*5) = 40.
    *   If they get 7 hours, their total would be 30 + (2*7) = 44.
2.  **"Per hour" and Multiplication:** Some students might just add 2 to 30, failing to multiply by the number of hours. This indicates a weakness in understanding rate or basic problem deconstruction.
3.  **Synthesizing Steps:** Even if they calculate the hours correctly and understand "per hour," they might struggle to combine these pieces into the final calculation (Initial + (
