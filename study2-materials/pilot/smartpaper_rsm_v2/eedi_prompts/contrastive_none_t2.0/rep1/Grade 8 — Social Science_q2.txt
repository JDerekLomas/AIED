Let's break down the question's difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Ease:** Harappan Civilization is a foundational topic in Class 6/7 Social Science (History) textbooks across India, including NCERT, which forms the basis for most state boards. Students would have been introduced to its features, including urban planning, in earlier grades. They should know the general name "Harappan" or "Indus Valley Civilization."
    *   **Hardship:** While introduced, the *depth* of recall might vary. Many students may remember *that* it had cities but struggle to pinpoint *specific* features without a recent review. Details about "grid layout," "drainage system," or "citadel" might be general knowledge for higher-achievers but specifics for others.

*   **Language Demands (English):**
    *   **Ease:**
        *   "Describe" is a common command verb in exams.
        *   "Key feature" is relatively straightforward.
        *   "Harappan Civilization" is a proper noun, typically presented as such even in Hindi texts, or with its Hindi equivalent readily recognizable.
        *   "Urban planning" combines "urban" (cities) and "planning" (making a design/system). "City planning" is a more common everyday phrase and can be easily understood from context for those with even basic English.
    *   **Hardship:**
        *   The students' limited English proficiency is the primary barrier. Even common words can cause misinterpretations or require mental translation, slowing them down and potentially losing nuances.
        *   Phrases like "key feature" might be more formal than their everyday vocabulary.
        *   While "Harappan Civilization" is a name, students might struggle with reading and fully comprehending the entire sentence in English, leading to frustration even if they know the answer in Hindi. They might confuse it with another civilization if their English reading is very weak.

*   **Nature of Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **Recall:** This question is almost entirely recall-based. Students need to remember specific information about the urban planning of the Harappan Civilization from their prior studies. There's minimal application or reasoning required beyond remembering the facts.
    *   **Ease:** Recall questions are often perceived as "easier" than application or reasoning questions because they don't demand higher-order thinking, only memory.
    *   **Hardship:** The challenge lies purely in the *volume* and *specificity* of what needs to be recalled. If their memory of the topic is vague or focused on other aspects (e.g., artifacts, discovery), they might struggle.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Ease:** This question format ("Describe one feature...") is very common in Class 8 Social Science textbooks and exams. It directly tests factual knowledge presented in chapters. The features listed in the rubric are standard textbook content.
    *   **Hardship:** None, in terms of format. The difficulty comes from the other factors.

**Synthesized Difficulty:**

The content (Harappan Civilization's urban planning) is standard Class 6/7/8 material, making the factual recall relatively straightforward for students who paid attention. The question format is also very typical. The biggest hurdle, by far, is the *English language proficiency*. Even if a student knows in Hindi that Harappan cities had *pucca makan* (baked bricks) or *naali vyavastha* (drainage system), formulating that into a correct English sentence like "advanced drainage system" or "use of baked bricks" presents a significant challenge. Some might correctly identify "grid pattern" because "grid" is visually distinctive, or "citadel and lower town" if they recall the drawing/diagram from textbooks.

Considering the "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%," and recognizing that many will stumble more on English expression than the factual recall, this question falls somewhere around or slightly above that average for those who *understand* the question.

*   Many students might know some facts in Hindi but fail to express them in coherent English.
*   Some might only remember "cities" or "bricks" but not connect it clearly to "urban planning."
*   High achievers will find this easy. Low achievers will be completely stumped by the language.

The "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%" suggests that for a general question, we shouldn't stray too far from it unless there's an overwhelming factor making it easier or harder. The content knowledge is reasonably accessible, but the language demand is significant. I expect a chunk of students will grasp the gist and try to answer, but execution in English will limit scores
