Let's break down the difficulty of this question for a Class 7 student in an Indian government Hindi-medium school from an economically weaker section.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Basic sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object):** This is generally taught in earlier grades, even in Hindi.
*   **Verb tenses (past simple):** The word "blew" indicates past tense, and understanding this is crucial for choosing the correct passive voice verb form. This is generally taught.
*   **Vocabulary:** "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away." These are fairly common words that would likely be introduced by Class 7, even for those with limited English exposure, possibly through nature studies or simple stories.
*   **Concept of Voice (Active/Passive):** This is the core grammatical concept being tested. It requires understanding that the "doer" of the action is the subject in active, and the "receiver" is the subject in passive. This concept itself, while taught in Hindi grammar (kartri-vaachya/karma-vaachya), needs explicit instruction and practice in English.

**Language Demands (English Proficiency):**

*   **Understanding "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice":** This instruction itself requires understanding key grammatical terms. "Change," "following sentence," "Active Voice," "Passive Voice" are all specialized English grammar terms. A student with limited English proficiency might struggle with just the instruction, even if they grasp the concept when explained in Hindi.
*   **Identifying the Subject, Verb, and Object:** "The wind" (subject), "blew" (verb), "the leaves" (object). While "the leaves" is somewhat recognizable due to "leaves," "wind" and "blew" might be a stretch for some.
*   **Forming the correct passive structure:** This involves:
    *   Making the object the new subject ("The leaves...").
    *   Choosing the correct form of "to be" ("were" because "leaves" is plural and "blew" is past tense).
    *   Using the past participle of the main verb ("blown" - an irregular verb).
    *   Adding "by the [original subject]" ("by the wind").
*   **Irregular Verb "blow-blew-blown":** This is a significant hurdle. Many students, especially those learning English, struggle with irregular verb forms. "Blew" to "blown" requires specific memorization.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Application:** It's not pure recall (like defining active voice). It requires applying a specific set of rules to transform a given sentence.
*   **Some Reasoning:** There's a small element of reasoning in deciding the correct "to be" form based on the plurality of the new subject and the original tense.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Mid-range difficulty for Class 7 English grammar:** This specific transformation is a standard exercise.
*   **Difficulty amplified by language barrier:** While a *typical* English-medium Class 7 student might find this manageable after instruction, for an English-as-a-second-language (ESL) student with limited exposure and potentially poor prior teaching, it's considerably harder.
*   **The irregular verb "blow-blew-blown" makes it harder than a regular verb.** If it were "The boy kicked the ball," it would be "The ball was kicked by the boy," which uses the regular past participle and is generally easier.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Pros (Easier aspects):** Simple, common vocabulary (leaves, wind). Straightforward SVO structure. Core concept is equivalent in Hindi grammar.
*   **Cons (Harder aspects):**
    *   **Instruction comprehension:** The command "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" is high-demand English.
    *   **Irregular Verb:** "blew" to "blown" is a known stumbling block.
    *   **Auxiliary Verb 'to be' choice:** Getting "were" (plural past) correct requires careful application of rules.
    *   **Syntactic transformation:** Students need explicit training on this specific English structure, which might be limited in resource-poor schools.

Given the average pass rate across items is 29%, this question is likely more difficult than that average due to the specific grammar point, irregular verb, and high language demands of the instruction itself. Even if they've *heard* about active/passive, applying it correctly to a sentence with an irregular verb will be tough for many.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:** 15%
