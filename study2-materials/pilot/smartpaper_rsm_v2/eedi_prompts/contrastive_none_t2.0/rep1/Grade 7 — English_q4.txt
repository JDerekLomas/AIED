Let's break down the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." using the provided framework.

**1. Contrastive Analysis**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low Prior Knowledge (general):** The question itself doesn't assume specific scientific facts, historical dates, or complex mathematical formulas.
    *   **Medium Prior Knowledge (passage comprehension):** It absolutely assumes the student has read, understood, and processed the *preceding reading passage* about the king's three questions (what is the right time, what is the most important thing to do, who are the most important people). Without understanding the context of the king's questions from the passage, the student cannot answer effectively.
    *   **Implicit Reasoning:** It assumes the ability to make a connection between a story/fictional scenario and "real life."

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Important" - Fairly common and likely understood.
        *   "Real life" - Common idiom, usually understood even with limited English.
        *   "Reason" - Common and clear.
        *   "King's questions" - Directly refers to the passage, relies on context.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple interrogative followed by an imperative. Very straightforward.
    *   **Abstractness:** While the individual words are simple, connecting a king's philosophical questions to "real life" and articulating a "reason" requires a degree of abstract thinking, moving beyond literal translation. This is where limited English might struggle not with individual words, but with forming a coherent thought in English.
    *   **Confounding Factors for Limited English:** Students might understand the individual words but struggle to formulate a grammatically correct and coherent sentence expressing their "reason" in English. They might know *why* but not be able to articulate it smoothly. The internal thought process might be in Hindi, and the translation to English for complex thought is challenging.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (minor):** Briefly recalling what the king's questions *were* from the passage.
    *   **Application (major):** Applying the *themes* of the king's questions to the student's understanding of "real life." This is not just rote memorization.
    *   **Reasoning (major):** Articulating *why* those questions are relevant in real life. This requires evaluative and explanatory reasoning. It moves beyond summarizing the text.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **More Difficult than Factual Recall:** Typical textbook exercises often ask for definitions, summaries of plot points, or direct answers derivable from the text (e.g., "What were the three questions the king asked?"). This question goes a step further, requiring interpretation and personal connection.
    *   **Potentially Easier than Complex Analysis:** It's not asking for literary devices, character analysis, or predicting future events. The required "reason" can be fairly simple (e.g., "Yes, because we all want to make good decisions," or "Yes, because it helps us to succeed"). The bar for a "valid reason" is likely not set very high.
    *   **Challenges of Open-Endedness:** The open-ended nature of "Give one reason" can be a double-edged sword. It allows for a variety of correct answers but can also be daunting for students accustomed to closed-ended questions with single right answers.

**2. Synthesis and Considerations for Class 7 Indian Government School Students**

*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** These students may have less exposure to higher-order thinking tasks in English. Their schooling might emphasize basic comprehension and recall.
*   **Hindi-Medium Schools / Limited English:** This is the biggest hurdle.
    *   While individual words are simple, constructing a reasoned *explanation* in English is demanding. They might have the thought in Hindi but fail to translate it into passable English.
    *   Grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and insufficient vocabulary for expressing nuances are very likely, even if the core idea is sound.
*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a low baseline, indicating a high level of difficulty for the exams overall. This specific question requires more than just recalling facts from a text; it asks for personal reflection and a justified opinion.

**Likely Obstacles:**

1.  **Formulation in English:** Struggling to construct a grammatically acceptable and comprehensible "reason" in English, even if the conceptual understanding is present in their minds (in Hindi).
2.  **Bridging Fictional to Real:** Some students might struggle to see the practical application of a "king's philosophical questions" to their
