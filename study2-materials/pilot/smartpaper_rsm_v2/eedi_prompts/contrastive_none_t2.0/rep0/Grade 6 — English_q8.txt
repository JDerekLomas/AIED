Let's break down the question for Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Word Recognition:** Students need to recognize common English words: "book," "reading," "a," "is," "he." These are very basic and likely introduced early in primary English education.
    *   **Basic Sentence Structure (implicitly):** While not explicitly taught as "SVO" until later, students in Class 6 would have encountered simple English sentences and formed a nascent understanding of how words usually go together (who does what, what is being done). This is likely reinforced through repetition in textbooks.
    *   **Verb "to be" conjugation:** Understanding that "is" goes with "he."
    *   **Present Continuous Tense:** "is reading" indicates an action happening now. This would be part of a Class 6 curriculum, if not earlier.

2.  **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The words themselves are extremely common and high-frequency. This is a significant advantage. Students from Hindi-medium schools would very likely have learned these words by Class 6.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** The core challenge lies in ordering the words correctly. While the vocabulary is easy, assembling it into the correct English grammatical structure ("He is reading a book") can be tricky for someone whose native language has different sentence structures (though Hindi is also SVO, which is helpful here).
    *   **Absence of Articles/Prepositions/Complex Punctuation:** The lack of extra articles, prepositions, or complex punctuation makes the task cleaner. There are no distractor words.
    *   **Phonological vs. Orthographic:** The task is purely orthographic (reading/writing), not involving listening or speaking directly, which might be an advantage for some students who learn through sight.
    *   **Conciseness:** The sentence is very short, minimizing cognitive load.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** of learned grammatical patterns and a dash of **Reasoning**.
        *   **Application:** Students are applying their knowledge of common English sentence patterns (subject-verb-object, present continuous) that they've likely seen many times.
        *   **Reasoning:** They need to mentally try out different combinations or recall the most natural-sounding order based on prior exposure, making logical sense of the action and the doer. It's not rote recall of a specific sentence, but the application of a known structure to new word combination.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Comparable/Slightly Easier:** This type of "jumbled words" exercise is *very common* in English language textbooks for this age group, specifically designed to test basic sentence formation. It's usually introduced after simple sentence structures and common verbs/nouns.
    *   The simplicity of the vocabulary and the standard SVO pattern ("He is doing X to Y") makes this relatively straightforward among such exercises. It avoids inversions, passive voice, or complex clauses.
    *   The words are not ambiguous in meaning or function within this context.

**Factors making it easier:**
*   Extremely common, high-frequency vocabulary.
*   Basic present continuous tense, widely taught.
*   Classic Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure, which aligns somewhat with Hindi structure and is fundamental to English.
*   "Jumbled words" is a standard and expected exercise type.
*   Short sentence, minimal words.

**Factors making it harder:**
*   Despite SVO alignment, different grammatical nuances between Hindi and English could cause slight confusion for some students (e.g., direct word-for-word translation might not work for verb placement exactly).
*   The general "limited English proficiency" is the main overarching hurdle. Students might recognize all words but still struggle to string them together correctly if their exposure to correct English sentence structure has been insufficient.
*   The difference between *understanding* the words and *producing* a grammatically correct sentence is significant.

**Overall assessment:** Given the very basic vocabulary, standard SVO pattern, common tense, and prevalence of this exercise type, this question leans towards the easier end for a Class 6 student *within the context of basic English proficiency expectations*. Many students would have practiced this. The average pass rate of 29% for all items suggests that this *individual item* is likely to be significantly higher than average, as it targets fundamental concepts.
