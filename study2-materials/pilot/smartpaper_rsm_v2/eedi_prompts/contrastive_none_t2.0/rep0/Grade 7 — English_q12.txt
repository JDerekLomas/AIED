Contrastive Analysis:

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Grammar Concepts (English):**
    *   Basic understanding of "sentence" and its components (subject, verb, object).
    *   Concept of "voice" (active vs. passive), though they might not know the technical terms.
    *   Irregular past participle forms (e.g., "blown" for "blew").
    *   Use of auxiliary verbs in the passive voice (e.g., "were").
    *   Understanding of prepositions like "by."
*   **Vocabulary (English):**
    *   "wind" (very common)
    *   "blew" (common past tense of "blow")
    *   "leaves" (common plural of "leaf")
    *   "away" (common adverb)
*   **General World Knowledge:** None beyond basic observation of wind and leaves.

**Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**

*   **Understanding Instructions:** The instruction "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" is the biggest linguistic hurdle.
    *   "Change" is common.
    *   "following sentence" is manageable.
    *   "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" are technical grammatical terms that are very unlikely to be known or understood by students with limited English, especially in a Hindi-medium context. Even if they've encountered *some* grammar rules, these specific terms might be absent or not deeply grasped.
*   **Understanding the Source Sentence:** "The wind blew the leaves away."
    *   All individual words are fairly common and represent concrete concepts (wind, leaves). "Blew" and "away" are also quite basic. This sentence is simple and direct.
    *   The grammatical structure is simple Subject-Verb-Object.
*   **Formulating the Passive Sentence:**
    *   Requires knowledge of how to restructure: object becomes subject, appropriate auxiliary verb + past participle, "by" + original subject. This is a complex transformation.
    *   Knowing the past participle "blown" is crucial.
    *   Knowing to use "were" (plural past tense for "leaves") is necessary.

**Is this Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   Primarily **Application**. It requires applying a specific set of grammatical rules for transformation.
*   It does involve **Recall** of specific terms (like "active/passive voice" if they know them) and past participle forms ("blown").
*   There's limited "Reasoning" beyond the procedural steps of the transformation.

**How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Instruction Difficulty:** The instruction itself ("Active Voice to Passive Voice") is likely significantly *more difficult* than typical Class 7 English exercises in Hindi-medium schools, where explicit terminology for complex grammar transformations might not be a major focus, or if taught, would likely be accompanied by extensive examples and scaffolding in Hindi. Students might practice changing sentences, but the formal metalanguage might be overwhelming.
*   **Sentence Difficulty:** The source sentence ("The wind blew the leaves away.") is very *typical and appropriate* for a Class 7 level in terms of vocabulary and syntax. It's a clear, concrete example suitable for this type of transformation.
*   **Transformation Difficulty:** The *skill* of transforming active to passive voice is generally considered an intermediate to advanced grammar point in ESL/EFL contexts. While taught, mastering it, especially with irregular verbs, is challenging. Many textbook exercises would offer simpler sentences, maybe regular verbs first, or multiple-choice options. Free production is harder.

**Overall Assessment:**

The major stumbling block will be the instructions. Even if students have an intuitive understanding of the *concept* of shifting focus (from actor to action/receiver), they are unlikely to recognize "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" as the specific tasks requested, given their background. They might just read the sentence and think it's an idiom or a general comprehension question.

If they somehow deduce (or guess from prior exposure to similar transformation questions, even if not labelled explicitly with "voice") that a transformation is needed, the actual application of passive voice rules, including the irregular past participle and correct auxiliary verb, is still a moderate challenge for this demographic.

Given the "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%," which already indicates low performance, this item feels on the harder side due to the specific technical terminology in the instructions and the production requirement for passive voice. However, the simplicity of the source sentence helps.

Let's consider two groups:
1.  **Students who understand the instruction "Active Voice to Passive Voice":** A small percentage. For them, the sentence is straightforward enough that many *might* get it right, perhaps 50-
