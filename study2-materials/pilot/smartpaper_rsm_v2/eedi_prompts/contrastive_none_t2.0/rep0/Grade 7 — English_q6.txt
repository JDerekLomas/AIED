Let's break down the question "Describes the poet's writing style" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed (Difficult):** This question implicitly assumes students have *read* some poetry (or a poem specifically from "the poet" mentioned in the preceding context, which is missing here but crucial). Beyond just reading, it assumes they have the meta-cognitive ability to analyze *how* something is written, not just *what* it says.
    *   **Assumed (Challenging):** Understanding the concept of "writing style" itself requires a leap from literal comprehension to critical analysis. While they might be able to identify a descriptive sentence, categorizing the *overall* style is a more advanced literary skill. They might understand "good" or "bad" writing, but not "descriptive," "informal," or "direct" as stylistic attributes.
    *   **Prior School Context:** Class 7 curriculum might introduce basic literary elements, but extensive analysis of "writing style" is typically a later-stage skill, especially when moving beyond basic prose. In Hindi-medium schools, such nuanced literary criticism in Hindi might not even be a focus at this age, let alone in English.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Describes":** This verb is relatively common and might be understood. Students might recognize it as "to tell about."
    *   **"Poet":** This is also a relatively common word.
    *   **"Writing style":** This is the core vocabulary challenge.
        *   "Writing" is understood.
        *   "Style" in this context is abstract. Many students might primarily associate "style" with fashion or a physical way of doing something (e.g., a "dancing style"). The specific meaning of "style" as a manner of literary expression is sophisticated and not frequently used in everyday English at their level. It's a formal, academic term.
        *   The *combination* "writing style" elevates the difficulty significantly. It's an academic phrase, not intuitive.
    *   **Rubric Words (Examples):** "Simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct."
        *   "Simple": Relatively easy.
        *   "Descriptive": A bit harder. "Description" or "describing" might be known, but "descriptive" as an adjective for style is more advanced.
        *   "Informal": Highly likely to be unknown or misunderstood. Students might struggle with "formal" vs. "informal" even in spoken contexts, let alone in written analysis.
        *   "Direct": Moderate difficulty. Could be confused with "straight."
    *   **Overall:** The combination of "writing style" as an abstract concept and the required vocabulary to express an appropriate answer makes the language demands very high for students with limited English. It requires both comprehension of the question's nuances and generation of appropriate English vocabulary, which might be out of their passive and active vocabulary range.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily **Application** and **Reasoning**. It requires:
        *   *Reading comprehension*: Understanding the source text (the poem, which is missing).
        *   *Analytical reasoning*: Breaking down how the text is written.
        *   *Application of knowledge*: Applying literary terms (even basic ones like "simple" or "descriptive") to the analyzed text.
    *   It's far beyond mere recall. It demands active cognitive processing and an understanding of literary elements.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **More difficult.** Typical Class 7 textbook exercises for English in these schools usually focus on:
        *   Literal comprehension (answering "who, what, when, where").
        *   Basic vocabulary (synonyms, antonyms, filling in blanks).
        *   Simple grammar structures.
        *   Recall of facts from a story/poem.
    *   Asking students to analyze and characterize "writing style" pushes into literary criticism, which is often introduced later or with very heavy scaffolding (e.g., multiple choice options with explanations). It requires a level of abstraction and critical thinking not commonly emphasized in standard exercises at this level. The lack of multiple-choice options for *their* potential answers further compounds the difficulty of expression.

**Crucial Missing Context:** The prompt is "Describes the poet's writing style." This implies a poem was *just presented*. The nature and complexity of that poem would heavily influence the difficulty. If it was a very simple, direct poem, some might grasp "simple." If it was highly descriptive, some might pick up
