Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the typical context:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Concept:** Understanding what "natural resources" are. This is typically covered in Class 6 EVS/Social Science. Students learn about basic natural resources like water, soil, minerals, forests.
    *   **Specific Context:** Knowledge of *Rajasthan* and its prominent natural resources. This is usually taught in regional geography chapters. Rajasthan is famous for its desert landscape, limited water, and mineral wealth. Most students, even with limited exposure, would likely know about 'water' and 'sand/desert' in relation to Rajasthan. Knowledge of specific minerals like Marble, Copper, or Zinc might be less universal but covered in some depth in the relevant chapters.
    *   **Relationship between Resources and Life:** The concept of how resources "influence lives" is a basic socio-economic concept taught from a young age (e.g., how farmers depend on water/soil, how fishermen depend on the sea).

2.  **Language Demands (English):**
    *   "Mention any two natural resources": "Mention" is a common verb in exam questions. "Natural resources" is a key academic term, likely learned and understood even if translated mentally into Hindi (प्राकृतिक संसाधन).
    *   "found in Rajasthan": "Found in" is straightforward. "Rajasthan" is the name of a state.
    *   "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":
        *   "Explain": A common command verb.
        *   "influences": This is perhaps the trickiest word. While its meaning is implied in context, it's not a common everyday vocabulary word for someone with limited English. Students might translate it as 'प्रवाहित करना' (to affect) or 'प्रभाव डालना' (to have an effect). However, understanding the *causal relationship* is key.
        *   "lives of the people there": Simple and direct.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Listing two natural resources from Rajasthan is largely recall-based.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** Explaining *how* one influences lives involves a basic level of application/reasoning. It's not just stating facts but demonstrating an understanding of cause and effect. For instance, linking 'water' to agriculture or daily life, or 'sand/desert' to livelihood (e.g., camel rearing, tourism related to desert).

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Part 1 (Listing resources):** This is a very common type of question in textbooks and exams ("List minerals found in X state," "Name two water sources"). Relatively easy.
    *   **Part 2 (Explaining influence):** This is slightly more challenging than a simple recall question but still a common type, moving towards comprehension and explanation. It's not deeply analytical but requires understanding basic cause-and-effect relationships related to geography and economy.
    *   **Overall:** The two-part structure (list then explain) makes it slightly harder than a single recall question. The "influence" part pushes it beyond mere memorization. Given the average pass rate of 29% for all items, this question feels somewhat in the middle of the difficulty spectrum. The language, especially "influences," might be a hurdle for some. The explanation part requires articulating a connection, not just identifying a fact.

**Specific Considerations for Class 6 Students in Indian Government Schools:**

*   **Regional Knowledge:** Rajasthan is a prominent state, and basic facts about it are usually covered. The dryness and mineral wealth are often highlighted.
*   **Common Knowledge:** Even if they struggle with academic terminology, the impact of water scarcity or the presence of minerals on a region is generally understood from observation and basic lessons.
*   **Scoring:** The rubric is generous for the explanation part; even a simple, correct explanation for one resource would likely get full marks.

**Breakdown of expected performance:**

*   **Able to list two resources (even if simple like water, sand, desert soil):** High likelihood, probably 60-70%.
*   **Able to connect one resource to people's lives (e.g., "Water is used for farming," "Because there is a lot of sand, people travel by camel" or "Copper mining provides jobs"):** This requires navigating the "influences" term and forming a coherent sentence in English. This is where many might struggle with the articulation, even if they have the underlying idea.

However, the "influence" can be very simple.
*   "Water: Farmers use water for crops."
*   "Marble: Used to
