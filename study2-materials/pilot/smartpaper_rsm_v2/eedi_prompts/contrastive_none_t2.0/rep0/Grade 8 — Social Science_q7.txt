Here's an analysis of the question, followed by the estimated proportion correct:

**Contrastive Analysis of the Question:**

"How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Crucial:** Students must know *what* the Battle of Plassey was (a victory for the British, specifically Robert Clive, over Siraj-ud-Daulah).
    *   **Crucial:** They need to understand *who* the key players were (British East India Company, Bengal Nawab).
    *   **Crucial:** They need to know the immediate *outcome* of the battle (Mir Jafar became Nawab).
    *   **Important Context:** A basic understanding of the concept of "expansion of British power" (e.g., how the British went from traders to rulers).
    *   **Less Crucial but Helpful:** Understanding the political landscape of 18th-century India (e.g., weakened Mughal Empire, regional nawabs).
    *   **No prior knowledge of abstract concepts (e.g., complex economic theories, advanced political science) is assumed.** It's historical recall and explanation.

*   **Language Demands (on students with limited English):**
    *   **"How did... contribute to..."**: This phrase requires understanding causality and linking an event to its consequences. While not extremely complex, it's more demanding than a simple "What was X?" or "When was X?" question. It necessitates expressing a cause-and-effect relationship.
    *   **"Battle of Plassey"**: A specific historical term. Many students might know this term from Hindi texts, but spelling/recognition in English could be a minor hurdle.
    *   **"expansion of British power"**: This phrase is fairly standard historical terminology. The core concept should be understood, even if the exact English phrasing is challenging. They'll likely interpret it as "British rule increased."
    *   **Vocabulary in Rubric (if known by students):** "political dominance/control," "puppet nawab." These are key explanatory terms. If students can recall these or similar simpler phrases (e.g., "British controlled Bengal," "Mir Jafar listened to the British"), they can score.
    *   **Overall:** The language is moderately challenging. It's not simplified English, but the core historical concepts (battle, British winning, more power) are likely taught using accessible language even in English-medium textbooks or translated by Hindi teachers. The difficulty lies in *articulating* the "how."

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Primarily Recall and Explanation:** Students need to recall the facts about Plassey and then explain its direct consequence in terms of British power.
    *   **Low-level Reasoning/Causality:** While not application of a complex theory, explaining "how" it contributed requires a basic level of reasoning – connecting cause (Plassey victory) to effect (British control of Bengal). It's more than simple recall of a date or a name, but less than analyzing long-term socio-economic impacts.
    *   It doesn't require applying a historical theory to a new scenario or solving a problem.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Medium-Easy:** This question is a very common topic in Class 8 Social Science history textbooks, often found as a short-answer question in chapter reviews or exercises.
    *   Textbooks typically dedicate a significant section to Plassey due to its pivotal role. Students would have read about it, potentially answered direct recall questions (Who fought? When?), and likely discussed its *significance* (which is what this question tests).
    *   The "how" aspect pushes it slightly beyond simple recall (e.g., "When was the Battle of Plassey?") but isn't as demanding as multi-part, analytical questions (e.g., "Analyze the long-term economic impact of British land revenue policies in Bengal").
    *   The answer, per the rubric, is quite focused and usually well-covered: "British control over Bengal" or "puppet ruler."

**Summary of Difficulty:**

The Battle of Plassey is a *central* topic in Class 8 Indian history. Its significance (leading to British political control in Bengal) is usually emphasized. The language, while not simplified, addresses core historical terms likely introduced and discussed in both English and Hindi. The "how" demands a basic cause-and-effect explanation, moving it slightly beyond pure recall but still within the expected range for short-answer questions. The biggest barrier would be not knowing the historical event itself or not being able to articulate the specific consequence (British control over Bengal) in English
