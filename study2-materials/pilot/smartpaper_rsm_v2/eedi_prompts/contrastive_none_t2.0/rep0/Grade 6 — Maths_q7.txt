Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the typical context.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Time Measurement:** Understanding "am" and "pm", and the ability to calculate elapsed time across noon (10 am to 4 pm). This is foundational and usually covered by Class 4-5.
*   **Addition:** Basic addition of integers.
*   **Multiplication:** Basic multiplication of small numbers.
*   **Concept of Temperature:** Understanding that temperature increases.

**Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**

*   "`10` am in the morning": Fairly straightforward. "Morning" reinforces "am."
*   "`temperature` of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`": "Temperature" is a key vocabulary word. "Was" indicates past/initial state. `30^0 C` is easily understood.
*   "If the `temperature increases` by `2^0 C per hour`": "Increases" is crucial. "Per hour" indicates a rate. This phrase might be slightly more complex but context often helps.
*   "then what will be the `temperature` of Jodhpur at `4:00 in the evening`?": "What will be" asks for a future state. "Evening" reinforces "pm."
*   The sentence structure is relatively simple for a word problem. Keywords like "increases" and "per hour" provide clear cues.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

This is primarily **Application**.
*   It's not simple recall of a fact.
*   It requires applying arithmetic operations (subtraction/counting for time, multiplication for total increase, addition for final temperature) in a sequence to solve a real-world problem.
*   While it involves applying learned operations, it also involves a mild degree of **reasoning** to connect "per hour" to the total hours and then add to the initial temperature.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Calculation of elapsed time across noon (10 am to 4 pm):** This is a common and often practiced skill in Class 5/6 math. Many textbooks will have direct "time difference" questions.
*   **Rate problems (e.g., increasing/decreasing by X per hour/day):** This is also a very common type of word problem introduced in Class 5/6. Examples might involve distance traveled, water flowing in a tank, etc.
*   **Multi-step problem:** It combines time calculation, multiplication, and addition. While it's multi-step, each step individually is usually covered.
*   **Context:** Temperature changes are relatable.

**Contrastive Analysis - What makes it Easy/Hard?**

**Easier aspects:**

*   **Straightforward language:** While English is a barrier, the numbers are clear, and keywords like "increases," "per hour," and time references (`am`, `pm`, `morning`, `evening`) are strong indicators of the operations needed. Many schools might use bilingual approaches or teachers explain in Hindi.
*   **Common problem type:** This type of word problem (rate x time + initial value) is very common in Class 5-6 mathematics. Students would likely have encountered similar problems with different contexts (speed, daily production, etc.).
*   **Integer arithmetic:** All numbers are whole numbers, avoiding fractions or decimals which add complexity.
*   **Direct calculation:** No inverse operations are needed (e.g., finding the starting temperature given the end temperature and rate).

**Harder aspects:**

*   **Language Barrier:** Even with straightforward language, reading and comprehending the English text can be the biggest hurdle for students with limited English proficiency. If they misunderstand "increases" or "per hour," the problem becomes unsolvable.
*   **Elapsed Time Calculation:** While common, going from 10 am to 4 pm *across noon* requires counting 10-11 (1 hr), 11-12 (1 hr), 12-1 (1 hr), 1-2 (1 hr), 2-3 (1 hr), 3-4 (1 hr) = 6 hours. Some students might incorrectly calculate 4-10 = 6 directly or stumble at 12 o'clock transition, especially if they are not fully comfortable with the 12-hour clock system and converting across noon.
*   **Multi-step:** While not extremely complex, some students struggle with chaining operations, even if they can perform each step individually. They might forget to add the initial temperature or miscalculate the total increase.
*   **Average Pass Rate Context (29%):** This suggests that many items are quite challenging. While this problem is "standard" in terms of math content
