Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis for 'My Favourite Hobby' Paragraph:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Hobby," "favourite," "paragraph," "mention," "enjoy," specific hobby vocabulary (e.g., "reading," "playing cricket," "drawing").
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** Basic sentence structure (subject-verb-object), present tense, use of conjunctions to link ideas (and, but, because, when), prepositions of time (in the evening, on weekends).
    *   **Content:** The concept of a hobby, personal reflection/opinion (why they enjoy it). This is generally relatable as most students, even from disadvantaged backgrounds, will have some activity they enjoy, even if it's just playing street games.
    *   **Structure:** Understanding of what a "paragraph" entails – a group of related sentences about one topic.
    *   **Task Understanding:** Comprehension of "Write a short paragraph... Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." This is multi-part instruction.

*   **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary Load:** While "hobby" might be a known word or easily understood in context, "favourite," "mention," and "enjoy" are relatively common but might not be immediately transparent for *all* students with very limited exposure. The instruction "write a short paragraph" itself requires comprehension of these specific English terms.
    *   **Sentence Construction:** Forming 4-5 coherent English sentences, using appropriate tenses and linking words, is a significant challenge. Many will struggle beyond simple declarative sentences. Complex sentences with clauses (e.g., "I enjoy it because...") will be difficult for many.
    *   **Expressing Abstract Concepts:** "Why you enjoy it" requires expressing feelings and reasons, which is more challenging than simply stating facts. They might know *what* they do but struggle to articulate *why* they like it in English.
    *   **Translating Ideas:** Students are likely to think in Hindi (or their regional language) and attempt a mental translation. This can lead to grammatically incorrect or awkward English sentences, even if the underlying idea is correct.
    *   **Rubric Match:** Even if they express the hobby and when they do it, articulating "why they enjoy it" with sufficient clarity to satisfy the rubric can be a stumbling block due to linguistic limitations.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This question is primarily **Application** of writing skills and personal information.
    *   It requires **Reasoning** to structure their thoughts and articulate "why" they enjoy something.
    *   It's not simple recall, but it does leverage their personal experiences.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises (Class 7, Indian Gov't Schools, English):**
    *   **Typical exercises:** Often focus on gap-filling, matching, true/false, direct answers to comprehension questions from a provided text, simple sentence formation based on given words, or short-answer definitions.
    *   **Difficulty:** This "My Favourite Hobby" question is significantly **more difficult** than typical textbook exercises in two key aspects:
        1.  **Open-ended composition:** It demands original thought and sentence construction for 4-5 sentences, not just modifying existing ones or extracting from a text.
        2.  **Personal expression:** Articulating personal feelings/reasons in English is a higher-order language skill than mere factual recall or structural manipulation.
        3.  **Synthesizing information:** They need to pull three distinct pieces of information (what, when, why) into a cohesive paragraph, which requires organizational skills.

*   **Ease Factors:**
    *   **Relatable content:** The topic of hobbies is universal and relatable, so they don't need to learn new conceptual knowledge. This makes *thinking* about the answer easier than a scientific or historical topic.
    *   **Personal choice:** Students can choose *any* hobby, which reduces the cognitive load of having to recall a specific, correct answer.

*   **Hard Factors:**
    *   **English writing proficiency:** This is the primary hurdle. Generating a coherent paragraph, 4-5 sentences long, expressing three distinct pieces of information, and articulating a *reason* in grammatically acceptable English, is a demanding task for students with an average pass rate of 29% on *items*, which often include easier question types.
    *   **Paragraph structure:** Many students at this level may not fully grasp the concept of a "paragraph" in terms of cohesive ideas, rather than just a collection of sentences.

Considering the "average pass rate across items
