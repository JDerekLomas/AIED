Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Reading Comprehension (English):** The student must be able to read and understand the poem provided in English. This is the biggest hurdle.
*   **Vocabulary (English):** The student needs to understand the individual words in the poem and the question. "Line," "poem," "like," "most," and "why" are relatively common, but if the poem itself uses complex vocabulary, the foundational understanding will be weak.
*   **Poetry Conventions (Basic):** Understanding what a "line" in a poem is, distinguishing it from a sentence.
*   **Self-reflection/Personal Opinion:** The student needs to be able to express a personal preference and a reason for it. This is a common social and cognitive skill but might be less practiced in academic settings if rote learning is emphasized.
*   **Expressing Cause and Effect:** The "why" requires a basic ability to link a preference to a reason.

**Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**

*   **Understanding the Question:**
    *   "Which line..." is a straightforward interrogative.
    *   "...from the poem..." links directly to the provided text.
    *   "...do you like the most..." requires understanding of personal preference and superlative.
    *   "...and why?" requires understanding of reason.
    *   The overall structure is common.
*   **Understanding the Poem:** This is where the primary language challenge lies. If the poem's vocabulary, sentence structure, or abstract concepts are difficult, the student won't even be able to choose a line meaningfully, let alone explain *why* they like it. Assuming the *poem itself* is suitable for a Class 6 English learner (simple vocabulary, clear narrative or imagery), this aspect might be manageable. However, if it's not simple, the whole task breaks down.
*   **Formulating an Answer (in English):**
    *   The student needs to write down a specific line (copying is allowed and even encouraged).
    *   They then need to articulate a reason. This is an output demand. While "because..." is a simple structure, finding the correct English words to express their "why" will be difficult. Common reasons might be simple (e.g., "it is funny," "it is about animals," "it sounds nice"), but even these simple phrases require some English vocabulary.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**

*   **Application (Selection):** Identifying a line they "like."
*   **Reasoning (Explanation):** Articulating "why" they like it. This is not rote recall; it requires critical engagement with the text and personal reflection. This moves beyond simple comprehension to basic interpretation and personal response.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Higher than basic comprehension:** Many Class 6 English exercises focus on answering direct questions (e.g., "What is the boy doing?", "Where did they go?"). This question requires an opinion and a justification.
*   **Lower than complex literary analysis:** It doesn't ask for themes, metaphors, or poetic devices, just a personal response.
*   **Unique due to "personal opinion" component:** Indian school settings, especially in government schools, often prioritize factual recall. Expressing a personal opinion and justifying it, particularly in written English, can be a novel demand. Students might be hesitant or simply unsure how to formulate an answer for such a question. They might struggle to generate a *reason* even if they understood the poem perfectly and had a favorite line.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Ease:**
    *   Question wording is relatively simple.
    *   "Like the most" is a common concept.
    *   Copying a line is a low-effort task.
    *   Rubric is generous (just "denotes a line" and "mentions why").
*   **Difficulty:**
    *   **The Poem's English Level:** This is the make-or-break factor. If the poem is beyond their grasp, the task is impossible. Assuming the poem *is* generally accessible.
    *   **Expressing Justification in English:** Even if they understand the poem and have a reason in mind (e.g., "I like it because it talks about trees, and I like trees"), translating that simple thought into grammatically correct and understandable English for "why" will be the primary struggle for the *majority* of students with limited English.
    *   **Cultural/Academic Emphasis:** The focus on personal opinion might be less practiced than rote learning or factual recall.
