Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the typical context:

**Contrastive Analysis**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Syntax:** Basic understanding of English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object). This is usually introduced by Class 4 or 5.
    *   **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely common (book, reading, a, is, he). These would have been introduced early in primary English education. "Reading" might be slightly less common than the others, but still foundational.
    *   **Concept:** Understanding of a present continuous action ("is reading"). This tense is typically covered by Class 5 or 6.
    *   **Implicit Rule:** Understanding that punctuation and capitalization are often cues in English (though not provided in the prompt for "He" in particular, students are generally taught to start a sentence with a capital letter). However, the rubric doesn't penalize for this.

2.  **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** Low demand. All words are high-frequency and likely known, even with limited exposure.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** Moderate demand. While students are taught basic SVO, applying it to rearrange jumbled words requires a deeper understanding than just passively recognizing it. The presence of the helping verb "is" and the -ing form ("reading") requires knowledge of the present continuous tense, which can be tricky for beginners, but usually introduced.
    *   **Instruction Clarity:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is a very common type of instruction in English exams, so the instruction itself should be familiar even if the English is weak.

3.  **Type of Cognitive Task:**
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** This is not pure recall. Students must *apply* their knowledge of English grammar rules and sentence structure to construct a grammatically correct and semantically meaningful sentence. It involves a degree of reasoning to fit the pieces together logically. It's a structured problem-solving task.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Moderate Difficulty:** This kind of "jumbled words" exercise is *very* common in Indian government school English textbooks and workbooks from Class 4 upwards. It's a standard practice item.
    *   **Not a basic recall:** It's more demanding than simply defining a word or answering a comprehension question where the answer is directly in the text.
    *   **Not complex reasoning:** It doesn't require inferential reasoning or creative writing. It's about applying learned grammatical rules.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Students might get the order wrong (e.g., "A book is he reading" or "Is he reading a book?"). The primary challenge is consistently putting the subject first, then the verb, then the object, especially with the 'is' and '-ing' form.

**Synthesis for this Specific Question:**

*   **Positive Factors:** Very common vocabulary, a standard exercise type in their curriculum, focuses on fundamental SVO structure.
*   **Challenging Factors:** Requires active application of grammar rules (not just passive recognition), understanding the present continuous tense structure. The absence of capitalization as a starting hint might make the first word selection slightly less automatic, though "he" is the most natural subject.

Given the average pass rate across items (29%), this question is likely *easier* than the average item. The words are foundational. The grammatical structure (present continuous S-V-O) is definitely taught. Many students would have practiced this exact type of question numerous times. While some might struggle with the specific S-V-O order, particularly the placement of "is" relative to "reading," the familiarity with the words and the task type increases the probability of success.

I'd expect a significantly higher success rate than the average 29%.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** **60%**
