Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **"Natural resources":** This term itself might be a barrier for some. While "prakritik sansadhan" would be understood, the English equivalent might not be firmly grasped by all, even if it's introduced in textbooks. They might have a basic intuitive understanding but struggle with the precise definition or its scope.
    *   **"Rajasthan":** They would undoubtedly know Rajasthan is a state in India. However, specific geographic knowledge about its natural resources (beyond the most obvious, like sand/desert and perhaps water scarcity) might vary significantly. Their geography curriculum would cover states and some major features, but detailed resource mapping at this specific grade level can be shallow.
    *   **Influence of resources on lives:** This requires a conceptual understanding of how geography and environment impact human societies. They would have basic exposure to this through discussions on agriculture, livelihoods, etc., but explaining the "how" in detail (especially in English) might be challenging.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **"Mention":** Straightforward command.
    *   **"Natural resources":** As discussed, this is the main linguistic hurdle. If they don't understand "natural resources," the entire question is inaccessible.
    *   **"Found in":** Simple and direct.
    *   **"Explain how... influences...":** "Influences" is a relatively common word but requires understanding cause-and-effect in a descriptive manner. The structure "explain how X influences Y" demands more than just listing.
    *   **Overall sentence structure:** Relatively complex for limited English. Two independent clauses joined by "and," with a dependent clause ("how one of them influences...") at the end.
    *   **Rubric simplicity vs. question complexity:** The rubric only requires mentioning two resources. The "explain how..." part of the question is not factored into the scoring for "Max score: 1", making the *actual* requirement for a correct answer simpler than the full prompt implies. This is a critical distinction. *If the rubric scores for merely mentioning two correct resources, it significantly reduces the linguistic and conceptual burden compared to what the question explicitly asks for in the "explain how" part.* For a full score (1 point), only two resources are needed.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **"Mention two natural resources":** Primarily recall. Students need to remember what "natural resources" are and then recall examples specific to Rajasthan. This is a knowledge-based item.
    *   **"Explain how one of them influences...":** This part requires a combination of recall (what are the characteristics of that resource) and basic reasoning/application (how those characteristics translate into impact on people's lives). *However, given the rubric only scores for mentioning two resources, the "reasoning/application" part is essentially irrelevant for achieving the 1 point.*

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical textbook exercises for Class 6 Social Science would have questions like "What are natural resources? Give examples." or "Name the capital of Rajasthan." or "How do farmers depend on water?"
    *   This question combines these elements: identifying resources for a *specific region* and implicitly linking them to life.
    *   The "mention two and explain one" structure is fairly standard, but the *English formulation* would be more challenging than a simple "list" or "define" question in a local language.
    *   The *content itself* (common resources in Rajasthan like water, marble, minerals) would likely be covered. The challenge lies in retrieving it in the requested format and language.
    *   Considering the rubric effectively boils it down to "Name two natural resources found in Rajasthan," this becomes a moderate-difficulty recall question in terms of content, with the English word "natural resources" as the main filter.

**Revisiting the Rubric's Impact:**

The fact that "Max score: 1" is awarded just for "Mentions two correct natural resources" is crucial. This completely de-emphasizes the "explain how one of them influences..." part. Therefore, students only need to:
1.  Understand "natural resources."
2.  Know that the question refers to Rajasthan.
3.  Recall *any two* resources found there.

Many students will know Rajasthan is a desert state, so "sand" or "water (scarcity)" would be easy guesses. They might also have studied about minerals or marble if their syllabus covered it. Sunlight is also an obvious one for a desert state.
