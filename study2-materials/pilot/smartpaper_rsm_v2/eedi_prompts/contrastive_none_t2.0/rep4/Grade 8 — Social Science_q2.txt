Let's break down the question for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have covered ancient Indian history, specifically the Harappan Civilization (also known as Indus Valley Civilization). This is standard content for Class 6 or 7 history in NCERT/SCERT textbooks and revisited in Class 8. They would typically have learned about its location, key cities, and main features.
    *   **Potential Gaps:** While the Harappan Civilization is covered, the *depth* of coverage on specific "urban planning" features might vary. Some might only remember generalities, not specific details like "grid layout" or "citadel." "Baked bricks" might be recalled as a construction material but not directly linked to "urban planning" by every student. "Advanced drainage system" is a strong contender for recall.

2.  **Language Demands (English Medium):**
    *   **"Describe":** A common command word. Should be understood.
    *   **"one key feature":** Straightforward.
    *   **"Harappan Civilization's urban planning":** This is the core term.
        *   "Harappan Civilization": Highly likely to be recognized from social science class, even if taught in Hindi.
        *   "urban planning": This term might be more challenging. While "शहर नियोजन" (shahar niyojan) is the Hindi equivalent and a common concept, students might struggle to instantly connect "urban planning" to "shahar niyojan" if their exposure to English social science terms is limited. They might understand "शहर" (city) and "निर्माण" (construction) separately, but not necessarily "planning" in this context. They might understand "features of Harappan cities" better than "urban planning." This is a significant hurdle.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Primarily Recall:** This question primarily tests recall of facts learned about the Harappan Civilization. There's no complex application or reasoning required beyond remembering specific characteristics.
    *   **Some Implicit Interpretation:** Students need to interpret "urban planning" to link it to appropriate features like street layout or drainage, rather than, say, art or religious practices.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical:** Most Class 8 history textbooks (even NCERT/SCERT ones, translated to English) would have questions asking about the features of Harappan cities or their culture. This question is quite direct and similar to common "list/describe features" type questions.
    *   **Slightly Higher than Basic Recall due to 'Urban Planning':** If the textbook question was simply "List two features of Harappan cities," it would be easier. The specific term "urban planning" elevates it slightly, making the exact translation/comprehension of that phrase crucial. Students might recall facts but not categorize them under "urban planning" without prompting.

**Specific Points of Difficulty/Ease:**

*   **Ease:** The Harappan Civilization is a foundational topic. Students *will* have heard of it. Features like the drainage system are often highlighted as unique and memorable. Baked bricks are also frequently mentioned.
*   **Difficulty:**
    *   **English Language Barrier for "urban planning":** This is the biggest single barrier. If a student doesn't grasp what "urban planning" means in this context, even if they know facts about Harappan cities, they might not know which facts to select or might give irrelevant information.
    *   **Precision vs. General Knowledge:** The question asks for a *key feature* of *urban planning*. Some might remember a feature like "they traded with Mesopotamia" (which is a general feature of the civilization but not urban planning). Students need to distinguish relevant facts.
    *   **Vocabulary Specifics:** While "drainage system" or "baked bricks" might be recalled, terms like "grid layout" or "citadel and lower town" might be less common in the recall of a student with average memory, especially if taught in Hindi first.

**Revised thought process:** The "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%" is a critical anchor. This indicates a general difficulty with the exam as a whole. Given this, and the English language barrier around "urban planning," a simple recall question like this, while common, will still be a struggle for many.

Many students *might* recall "advanced drainage system" even with imperfect English comprehension of "urban planning," because it's such a defining and often-repeated feature. They might interpret "urban planning" as simply "what were cities like?"

Considering the 29% average, this specific question is probably slightly *above* that average due to it being a prominent,
