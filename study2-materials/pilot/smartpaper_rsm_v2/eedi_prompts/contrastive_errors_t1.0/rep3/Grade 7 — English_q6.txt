Let's break down the question "Describes the poet's writing style" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Describes": A common verb, likely encountered.
        *   "Poet's": Possessive form of "poet," again, likely encountered.
        *   "Writing style": This is the trickiest part. It assumes an understanding of what "style" means in the context of writing – not just the physical act of writing, but the *manner* or *characteristic way* something is written. This is a higher-order concept.
    *   **Literary Analysis:** To answer correctly, students need to have some concept of analyzing *how* a poem is written, not just *what* it's about. This requires exposure to discussing literary elements, even if basic.
    *   **Exposure to Poetry:** They would need to have read a poem (which would presumably be provided alongside this question, though not explicitly stated here). Without a poem, the question is unanswerable.

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **"Describes":** This verb is relatively straightforward.
    *   **"Poet's writing style":** The phrase itself is relatively simple structurally (possessive + noun + noun). However, the *concept* of "writing style" is abstract and challenging. It's not a concrete object.
    *   **Expected Answer:** The rubric expects a single descriptive word (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct). This requires students to not only understand the question but also retrieve appropriate English adjectives for literary analysis. This vocabulary might be beyond their typical functional English.
    *   **Common Errors Observed:**
        *   "I am reading." This shows a complete misunderstanding of the question, perhaps focusing only on "describes" and linking it to their current action, or possibly thinking "writing style" refers to their own reading.
        *   "Empty Response": A very high number of these indicate either total incomprehension of the question or an inability to formulate any answer. This is a strong indicator of difficulty.
        *   The other examples (Q: "Write a theme..." and Q: "Write a short paragraph...") show struggles with abstract concepts, extended writing, and basic sentence structure, even when the topic is more concrete ("My Favourite Hobby"). The "writing style" question is even more abstract.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** and **Reasoning**. It's not recall of facts.
    *   **Application:** Students need to apply their understanding of literary concepts (if they have any) to a given poem.
    *   **Reasoning:** They need to reason about *how* the poet wrote, not just *what* the poet wrote. This requires a level of analytical thinking that is advanced for this demographic and language level.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical exercises:** Often focus on comprehension (who, what, when, where), vocabulary definitions, basic grammar, or simple creative writing prompts (like "My Favourite Hobby").
    *   **This question:** "Describes the poet's writing style" is significantly harder. It delves into literary analysis, which is usually introduced later or with much more scaffolding.
        *   It requires understanding an abstract concept ("style").
        *   It requires applying that understanding to specific text.
        *   It requires generating a suitable analytical adjective in English.
    *   The 4% pass rate for this exact question on the exam strongly corroborates its high difficulty relative to other English content. The other low pass rate items (5% for theme, 10% for paragraph) also highlight the general struggle with higher-order tasks and extended writing. This question is even more abstract than identifying a "theme."

**Conclusion on Difficulty:**

This question is exceptionally difficult for Class 7 students with limited English proficiency from economically weaker sections. The concept of "writing style" is abstract and requires a level of literary analysis that is likely beyond their current curriculum and language capabilities. The common errors (especially "I am reading" and "Empty Response") perfectly illustrate this fundamental misunderstanding.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 3-5%**

Given the provided 4% pass rate for this *exact* question, I'm sticking very close to that. My analysis confirms why it would be so low. The 3-5% range acknowledges minor fluctuations but strongly reflects the inherent difficulty based on the context provided.
