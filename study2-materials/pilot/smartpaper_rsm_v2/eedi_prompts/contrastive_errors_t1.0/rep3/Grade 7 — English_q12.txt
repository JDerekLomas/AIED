Let's break down the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away" using the provided context and error analysis.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Grammatical Concepts:** A fundamental understanding of active and passive voice. This means recognizing the subject, verb, and object in a sentence, and knowing how their roles shift in passive voice.
    *   **Verb Tenses:** Knowledge of past simple tense (blew) and how it transforms into the passive voice (were blown). Specifically, the past participle form of irregular verbs (blow-blew-blown).
    *   **Vocabulary:** Basic vocabulary: "wind," "blew," "leaves," "away." These are common words for Class 7.

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Technical Terminology:** "Active Voice," "Passive Voice," "Change." These terms themselves can be a barrier. If students haven't been explicitly taught these terms in English (or their Hindi equivalents and how they map to English grammar), they might not even understand the *instruction*, let alone the task.
    *   **Syntactic Transformation:** This requires understanding and applying grammatical rules for sentence restructuring. It's not just recognizing words or simple recall.
    *   **Irregular Verbs:** The verb "blow" is irregular, requiring knowledge of its past participle "blown." This is a common point of difficulty even for native speakers learning grammar.
    *   **Prepositional Phrase:** The "by the wind" part, while standard, adds a small layer of complexity.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Application:** Primarily application. Students need to recall the rules of active/passive voice transformation and apply them to a novel sentence.
    *   **Some Recall:** Recalling the specific past participle form of "blow."
    *   **Minimal Reasoning:** The main "reasoning" is identifying the subject/object and applying the transformation logic.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Difficulty Level:** This is a *standard* Class 7 grammar exercise for students in English-medium schools or those with good English proficiency. However, for students with *limited English proficiency* and from Hindi-medium backgrounds, it's quite challenging.
    *   **Similar to "Describes the poet's writing style" (pass rate 4%) or "Write a theme..." (pass rate 5%):** These questions require abstract understanding, critical thinking, and structured writing, which are very difficult. Our question is more concrete and rule-based.
    *   **Compared to "My Favourite Hobby" (pass rate 10%):** That question requires basic paragraph writing and personal expression, but many errors show a lack of basic sentence structure or ability to stay on topic. Our question is more constrained and focused on a single grammatical transformation.
    *   **Key Difference:** The common errors on other questions (empty response, incorrect context, simple lists) suggest a fundamental inability to comprehend the prompt or formulate coherent English sentences. This question, while grammatical, still requires *syntactic manipulation*, which is a step beyond just forming a simple sentence. If they struggle with "My hobby is cricket play," they will struggle significantly with voice transformation.

**Likely Challenges and Errors:**

*   **Understanding the Instruction:** Many might not know what "Active Voice" or "Passive Voice" means. They might just try to rephrase the sentence randomly.
*   **Irregular Verb Form:** Using "blowed" or simply omitting the verb transformation.
*   **Incorrect Auxiliary Verb:** Using "is blown" instead of "were blown" (tense error).
*   **Subject-Object Inversion Failure:** Not moving "the leaves" to the subject position.
*   **Omitting "by the wind":** While grammatically acceptable in some contexts, for a direct transformation exercise, it's expected.
*   **Empty Response:** If the instruction is entirely alien.
*   **Attempting a different type of transformation:** e.g., changing tense, or just rewording without changing voice.

Given the average pass rate of 29% across items, and the very low pass rates for questions requiring *any* form of structured English writing or grammatical understanding beyond basic recall, this question is at the harder end of the spectrum for this student population. The technical terminology and the requirement to apply a rule to restructure a sentence are significant hurdles.

The example errors ("I am reading" for writing style, "The last bargin they about a child and labour" for theme, "My hobby is cricket play") strongly suggest that basic sentence construction and understanding of grammatical
