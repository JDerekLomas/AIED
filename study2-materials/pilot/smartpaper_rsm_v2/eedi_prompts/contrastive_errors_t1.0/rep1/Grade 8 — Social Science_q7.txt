Let's break down the question and its likely impact on Class 8 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis of "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Specificity of Battle:** Students need to know *of* the Battle of Plassey, its year (1757), and that it involved the British.
    *   **Actors Involved:** They should ideally know about the British East India Company, the Nawab of Bengal (Siraj-ud-Daulah), and the treachery of Mir Jafar.
    *   **Consequences:** Most importantly, they need to understand the *outcome* of the battle and its immediate political implications. This is standard Class 8 Indian history curriculum.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Keywords:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "contribute," "expansion," "British power," "India."
    *   **Complexity:** The question structure is straightforward "How did X contribute to Y?". It's a cause-and-effect question.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Contribute," "expansion," and "power" are relatively common terms in a historical context. "Dominance" or "control" (from the rubric) might be slightly more advanced, but the core concept is understandable.
    *   **Comparison to other difficult questions:** This question is less abstract than "Explain how colonial rule... affected tribal communities" (which requires understanding socio-economic impact). It's also more direct than "Why are lions shown on currency notes?" (which requires symbolic interpretation and knowledge of Ashoka's pillars). The question about Ashoka's reign is similar in historical recall but the Plassey question is more focused on a singular event and its direct consequence.

*   **Type of Cognitive Demand:**
    *   **Recall:** Largely recall of historical facts – the event itself, its participants, and its immediate aftermath.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** There's a slight element of reasoning required to link the *victory* (the "how") to the *expansion of power* (the "contribute to"). It's not just stating what happened, but explaining *why* it mattered for British power. However, this link is usually explicitly taught alongside the battle itself.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is a very common type of exercise for this topic. Textbooks often have questions like "What were the consequences of the Battle of Plassey?" or "How did the British gain control over Bengal after Plassey?" The prompt directly asks for the contribution to British power, which is the key takeaway from the chapter on Plassey.
    *   It is less open-ended than "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign," where students might have to synthesize multiple aspects. Plassey's significance is quite focused on the establishment of political control.

**Analysis of Potential Pitfalls for These Students:**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** While the language is fairly direct, terms like "contribute" and "expansion" could still pose a challenge for students with very limited English, leading to misinterpretation or an inability to articulate a correct answer even if they know the facts in Hindi.
2.  **Rote Memorization vs. Understanding:** Students might have memorized "Battle of Plassey 1757, British won, Mir Jafar became Nawab," but struggle to connect this directly to "expansion of British power" in a coherent sentence in English.
3.  **Specific Details:** Students might know the battle happened but forget the exact outcome or the name Mir Jafar, making it harder to provide a complete answer for full credit. The rubric specifically mentions "political dominance/control over Bengal" and "placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab."

**Comparing to Common Errors:**
The given common errors are quite severe: "Empty Response," "Asher' stand," "Ashok seamb." This suggests a significant portion of students struggle with basic comprehension, recall, and even formulating *any* coherent answer, especially when the pass rates are so low (9-12%).

The Plassey question is arguably **easier** than the "tribal communities" question because it's a specific event with a clear, taught cause-and-effect. It's also **easier** than the "lions on currency" question, which requires symbolic reasoning. It's perhaps **comparable in *potential* difficulty to the Ashoka question**, but the answer for Plassey is more singularly focused.

Given the low average pass rate (29%) and the particularly low pass rates for similar Social Science questions (9-12%), even a question that seems "standard" can
