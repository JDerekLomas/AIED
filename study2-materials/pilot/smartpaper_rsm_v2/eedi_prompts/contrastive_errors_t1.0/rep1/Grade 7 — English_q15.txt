Let's break down the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Hobby," "favourite," "paragraph," "sentences," "mention," "enjoy." These are relatively common words at this level, often introduced in early primary grades.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** Basic sentence structure (subject-verb-object), ability to form simple and compound sentences, use of present tense for describing a hobby and present tense for stating enjoyment.
    *   **Concept:** Understanding what a "hobby" is (a regular activity done for pleasure). This is a common theme in primary school English lessons.
    *   **Paragraph Structure:** The concept of a "paragraph" and the instruction "4-5 sentences" indicates an expectation of basic paragraphing skills, though not necessarily sophisticated topic sentences or concluding remarks.

2.  **Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary Accessibility:** The core vocabulary is quite accessible. "Hobby" and "favourite" are likely among the first English words learned related to personal interests.
    *   **Sentence Complexity:** The prompt asks for simple factual information ("what," "when," "why"). Students can use very basic sentence structures like "My hobby is..." "I do it on..." "I enjoy it because..."
    *   **Open-ended vs. Structured:** While it's an open-ended "write a paragraph" task, the prompt provides clear scaffolding by explicitly asking for three specific pieces of information ("what," "when," "why"). This reduces the cognitive load of generating ideas and structuring the response.
    *   **Personal Relevance:** The topic "My Favourite Hobby" is highly personal and relatable. Students don't need to recall external facts or complex abstract concepts. They can draw directly from their own experiences, which often makes it easier to express even with limited language.
    *   **Common Errors Observed:**
        *   The common error "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" shows that students understand *parts* of the prompt (favourite, games) but struggle with the "paragraph" and "4-5 sentences" part, often listing or writing unconnected thoughts.
        *   "My hobby is cricket play" is grammatically imperfect but clearly conveys the hobby. This suggests they can identify the hobby, but struggle with more advanced grammar.
        *   The "Empty Response" common for "Describes the poet’s writing style" or "Write a theme..." is less likely here due to the personal nature and scaffolding.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application** task, requiring students to apply their basic English writing skills to a personal topic.
    *   It involves some degree of **recall** of vocabulary and basic grammar.
    *   It requires minimal **reasoning**, primarily simple causal reasoning for "why you enjoy it" (e.g., "because it is fun," "because I learn new things"). It does not demand complex inferential or analytical reasoning like interpreting poetry.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easier:**
        *   Compared to "Describes the poet’s writing style" (4% pass rate) or "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate), this question is significantly easier. Those questions require abstract thinking, interpretation, and specific literary vocabulary, which are far beyond the typical Class 7 comprehension level, especially in a second language context.
        *   The previous common errors highlight the difficulty with abstract concepts and literary analysis.
    *   **Comparable/Slightly Easier:**
        *   Compared to a simple "write about yourself" exercise often found in initial English lessons. The "4-5 sentences" and "paragraph" instruction adds a minor layer of structural complexity.
    *   **Key Differences:**
        *   **No new information acquisition:** Students are not asked to read a text and then respond to it. This eliminates the reading comprehension barrier.
        *   **High personal relevance:** This topic is universally relatable and doesn't require specific cultural or academic background knowledge beyond their own life experiences.
        *   **Clear prompts:** The three explicit sub-questions (what, when, why) provide a very clear framework, making it less intimidating than a completely open-ended essay.

Given the common errors seen on other English questions, a key challenge will be producing 4-5 *coherent sentences* in a *paragraph* format, rather than just listing items or writing one short, grammatically flawed sentence.
