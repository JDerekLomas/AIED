Let's break down the question "Describes the poet’s writing style" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their typical profile.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The core challenge is "writing style." This is an abstract concept. While students might understand "writing" and "style" individually, combining them to understand "how the poet writes" is complex. They are likely more familiar with concrete vocabulary.
    *   **Literary Analysis:** This question falls under basic literary analysis. Students at this level might be introduced to simple poetic devices or themes, but explicitly analyzing "writing style" requires a step beyond mere comprehension. They might know *what* the poem is about, but not *how* it's written.
    *   **Exposure to diverse writing styles:** Their exposure might be limited to textbook poetry, which often has a fairly consistent, straightforward style. They might not have the vocabulary or analytical framework to differentiate between, say, "simple" vs. "descriptive" vs. "complex."

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Abstract Nouns/Concepts:** "Writing style" is an abstract concept. Students with limited English proficiency often struggle with abstract vocabulary and concepts compared to concrete ones (e.g., "apple" vs. "democracy").
    *   **Command Verb:** "Describes" is a common verb, but applying it to an abstract concept like "style" adds a layer of difficulty. They might understand "describe an object" much better.
    *   **Required Output:** The rubric asks for "a suitable and relevant word describing the writing style." This requires generating appropriate English vocabulary (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct). This is a productive skill, which is generally harder than receptive skills (reading/listening). Many students might not possess this specific analytical vocabulary in English.
    *   **Common Errors Observed:** The common errors ("I am reading," "Empty Response") strongly suggest a fundamental lack of comprehension of the question itself, or an inability to formulate a relevant answer in English, even if they had a vague idea. "I am reading" implies they might just be stating an action related to the poem, not analyzing it.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application and Reasoning**. It's not recall (they don't recall a pre-taught definition of *this specific poet's* style). It requires them to:
        *   Read and comprehend the poem (implicit, as the question *follows* a poem).
        *   Understand what "writing style" means.
        *   Analyze the poem to identify characteristics of its style.
        *   Translate those characteristics into appropriate English descriptive words.
    *   This is a higher-order thinking skill than simple comprehension or recall.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **More difficult.** Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises might include:
        *   Answering direct comprehension questions about the poem's content ("Who is the speaker?", "What happened in the second stanza?").
        *   Identifying rhyming words or simple figures of speech (e.g., "Find two similes").
        *   Filling in blanks with vocabulary from the poem.
        *   Writing short answers about their feelings or opinions related to the poem.
    *   Analyzing "writing style" is a more advanced task. It moves beyond "what" the poem says to "how" it says it, which is often introduced more thoroughly in later grades or for more advanced students. The specific vocabulary required for the answer is also likely not explicitly taught or practiced extensively at this level.

**Why the low observed pass rate (4%) is understandable for this question:**

*   **Abstract nature:** The question itself is abstract.
*   **Vocabulary gap:** Students lack the English vocabulary to describe writing styles.
*   **Analytical gap:** They may not have the analytical framework for style.
*   **English proficiency:** Even if they vaguely understood the concept, expressing it correctly in English is a major hurdle.
*   **Common errors:** "I am reading" indicates they might just be thinking "this is about reading a poem," not "how is the poem written." "Empty response" means they simply don't know what to do.

**Conclusion:**

This question is significantly harder than the average Class 7 English item for these students. It demands abstract understanding, specific analytical vocabulary, and higher-order thinking skills that are generally beyond what is typically emphasized or mastered at this level, especially given their limited English proficiency and educational background. The observed average pass rate of 29% across *all* items already suggests a high overall difficulty. For this specific, highly abstract and analytical
