Let's break down the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common errors.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Favourite," "hobby," "paragraph," "sentences," "mention," "enjoy." These are relatively common words taught in elementary English, but "paragraph" might be challenging for some to execute structurally.
    *   **Grammar:** Basic sentence structure (SVO), present tense for describing habits, use of conjunctions (and, because), simple prepositions (in, on, at).
    *   **Concept:** Understanding what a "hobby" is (a leisure activity) and being able to articulate one. This is a common essay topic from primary school.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Question Comprehension:** The core concepts ("My Favourite Hobby," "what it is," "when you do it," "why you enjoy it") are quite direct and use simple vocabulary. The structure is an imperative ("Write... Mention...").
    *   **Production:** This is where the difficulty lies.
        *   **Sentence Construction:** Students need to form 4-5 *coherent* sentences, not just isolated words or phrases.
        *   **Paragraph Structure:** While "paragraph" is mentioned, many students might struggle to connect sentences logically or maintain a single topic. The provided examples show fragmented or list-like responses even when a paragraph is asked for.
        *   **Specificity:** They need to provide *specific* details (the hobby, time, reason) rather than generic statements.
        *   **Vocabulary for Explanation:** Explaining *why* they enjoy it might require a slightly broader vocabulary than just naming the hobby. Phrases like "it makes me happy," "I learn new things," "it keeps me fit" are common, but forming these into grammatically correct sentences can be hard.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Recalling vocabulary and grammatical rules.
    *   **Application:** Applying those rules to construct original sentences and a short paragraph based on personal experience. This is primarily an application task.
    *   **Reasoning:** Minimal reasoning beyond articulating personal preference. It's not abstract or analytical.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical Textbook Exercises:** Often involve fill-in-the-blanks, matching, short answer questions (1-2 words/phrases), rearranging sentences, or very guided sentence construction.
    *   **This Question:** This question requires *extended free-form writing*. While "My Favourite Hobby" is a very common essay topic, the *execution* of a 4-5 sentence paragraph with specific elements is significantly harder than typical textbook exercises that focus on discrete grammar points or vocabulary. The average pass rate of 29% for items on this exam, and even lower for open-ended writing, suggests that *any* extended writing task is challenging.

**Comparison with Provided Common Errors:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)**: This is highly abstract and requires analytical skills, plus specific literary vocabulary. "I am reading" shows complete misunderstanding. Our target question is much more concrete and personal.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."" (pass rate: 5%)**: Again, abstract, requires interpretation, and understanding literary concepts. "The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la" shows an attempt but poor grammar and structure. Our question is less abstract.
*   **"Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what" (pass rate: 10%)**: This *is* the question we're analyzing, and its pass rate is 10%. The provided wrong answers are illustrative:
    *   "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" - Lists hobbies, then food, then trails off. Shows inability to form sentences or paragraphs on a single topic, and major spelling issues.
    *   "My hobby is cricket play" - A single, grammatically incorrect sentence, not a paragraph.
    *   "My Favowrife Hobby cbaking\nMy Favowrife" - Misspelling, incomplete, not a paragraph.

The existing 10% pass rate for this *exact* question is a strong indicator. The common errors show that students struggle with:
*   Forming grammatically
