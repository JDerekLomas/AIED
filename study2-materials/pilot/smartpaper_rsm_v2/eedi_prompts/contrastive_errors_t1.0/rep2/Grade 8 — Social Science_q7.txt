Let's break down the question and its likely impact on Class 8 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Event:** Students are expected to know *about* the Battle of Plassey (1757). This is a foundational event in Indian history syllabi for Class 8, usually covered in the chapter on the advent of European powers and the rise of British rule. They should at least know it was a significant battle between the British East India Company and the Nawab of Bengal.
    *   **Context:** They need to understand the concept of "expansion of British power" – that the British were consolidating their rule.
    *   **Causality:** The question asks "How did... contribute," implying an understanding of cause and effect.

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   "How did... contribute to..." is a fairly standard question structure.
    *   "Expansion of British power" uses common vocabulary.
    *   The core difficulty lies in articulating the *specific mechanism* of contribution. If a student understands the concept in Hindi, translating that nuance into coherent English might be challenging, especially for terms like "political dominance," "puppet nawab," or "revenue control."
    *   The common errors seen (e.g., "Empty Response," "Asher' stand") suggest a significant barrier in comprehending the question or formulating an answer in English, even if the underlying knowledge might exist in their mother tongue. The "Asher' stand" error for the "lions on currency" question is particularly telling, indicating a complete misinterpretation or a desperate attempt to write something.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Primarily recall of historical facts and their immediate consequences. Students would have memorized that Plassey led to British control over Bengal and the installation of a puppet ruler.
    *   **Reasoning/Application (mild):** There's a slight element of reasoning required to connect the *victory* at Plassey specifically to the *expansion of power*. It's not just "what happened at Plassey," but "how did it lead to X?" However, this causal link is typically explicitly taught and reinforced in textbooks.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is a **standard, mid-level difficulty question** that would appear in textbook exercises or end-of-chapter reviews. It's not an obscure detail.
    *   It's more complex than simple recall (e.g., "When was the Battle of Plassey?") but less complex than higher-order thinking questions (e.g., "Critically analyze the long-term impact of the Battle of Plassey on Indian economy").
    *   Compared to the examples given ("Explain how colonial rule... affected tribal communities," "Why are lions shown..."), this question is perhaps slightly *easier* in terms of direct recall of a specific, well-defined event and its immediate consequence. The tribal communities question requires synthesizing broader knowledge, and the lions question can be tricky if they don't explicitly remember the Ashoka pillar connection. The Ashoka reign question is also quite broad. This Plassey question is more focused.

**Factors Influencing the Estimate:**

*   **Foundation Event:** Plassey is a cornerstone of the Class 8 history syllabus regarding the British in India. Students *should* have encountered this multiple times.
*   **Rubric Simplicity:** The rubric is quite lenient: "establishing British political dominance/control over Bengal" or "placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab." This means a partially correct answer describing the immediate political fallout would likely score.
*   **English Barrier:** This is the *biggest* impediment. Even if they know the facts in Hindi, articulating it in English without spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, or complete misinterpretations is hard. The examples of common errors strongly support this. "Empty Response" is a very common issue.
*   **Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a general benchmark. The questions with 9-12% pass rates are significantly harder due to breadth, ambiguity, or specific knowledge required that might not be easily recalled or translated. This Plassey question feels *more direct* than those.

**Conclusion:**

While the content is standard and the rubric allows for a relatively simple explanation, the significant English language barrier and the prevalence of "Empty Response" answers will drag the score down considerably. However, its importance in the curriculum means a certain percentage *will* have memorized the key outcome and can manage to convey it in basic English.

Given the common errors and the general difficulty, but acknowledging that Plassey is a very central topic taught repeatedly, I anticipate a pass rate higher than the 9-12%
