Let's break down the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." for Class 7 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Hobby," "enjoy," "favourite," "paragraph," "mention." These are fairly common words, likely encountered in earlier grades or daily life, even if English proficiency is limited. "Paragraph" might be a challenge if formal writing instruction has been minimal.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** Basic sentence structure (subject-verb-object), present tense for habits/preferences, conjunctions (and, because).
    *   **Concept:** Understanding what a "hobby" is (leisure activity). This is a very common and relatable concept across cultures.
    *   **Self-reflection:** Ability to articulate personal preferences and reasons. This is usually easier than abstract concepts.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Simplicity of Prompt:** The instructions are very direct and use relatively simple vocabulary. "Write a short paragraph" is clear. "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" breaks down the task into explicit components, which is helpful.
    *   **Relatability:** The topic "My Favourite Hobby" is extremely personal and familiar. Students don't need to understand complex literary devices or historical facts. They can draw directly from their own experiences. This significantly reduces the cognitive load compared to understanding a poem or abstract concept.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Students can likely use simple, declarative sentences. "My favourite hobby is playing cricket. I play it in the evening. I enjoy it because it is fun." This level of English is accessible.
    *   **Common Errors Observed on Exam:**
        *   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)**: This question is highly abstract, requires understanding literary analysis, and uses complex vocabulary ("describes," "poet's writing style"). It's completely out of reach for most. The answers "I am reading" or "Empty Response" show a complete lack of comprehension of the task.
        *   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."" (pass rate: 5%)**: Similar to the above, this requires comprehension of a poem (potentially unseen or difficult), abstract thinking to identify a "theme," and the ability to articulate it in English. The wrong answers show either no understanding or a complete misinterpretation (e.g., "about a child and labour," which might be a literal observation rather than a theme).
        *   **"Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what" (pass rate: 10%)**: This is *the exact same question* from the example. The given wrong answers ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy", "My hobby is cricket play", "My Favowrife Hobby cbaking\nMy Favowrife") are very telling.
            *   "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy": Shows an understanding of "favourite" and "game/food," but lists rather than writes a paragraph, and veers off-topic. It suggests a lack of understanding of "paragraph" and the specific instructions.
            *   "My hobby is cricket play": A correct start, but grammatically incorrect and too short.
            *   "My Favowrife Hobby cbaking\nMy Favowrife": Shows understanding of the topic, but very poor spelling and incomplete.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This question primarily requires **recall** of personal information (what their hobby is, when they do it) and **application** of basic English sentence construction.
    *   It requires very minimal **reasoning** beyond articulating "why I enjoy it," which is usually a simple statement for this age group (e.g., "it is fun," "I learn new things," "I get strong").

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This type of question ("Write about yourself," "My favourite...") is very common in early English language learning textbooks. It's often one of the first paragraph-writing exercises after basic sentence formation.
    *   The explicit bullet points ("what it is, when you do it, why you enjoy it") make it even *easier* than a typical open-ended "Write about your hobby" task, as it provides a clear structure
