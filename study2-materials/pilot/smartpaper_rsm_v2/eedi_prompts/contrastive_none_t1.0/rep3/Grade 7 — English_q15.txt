Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, keeping their typical background in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty: 'My Favourite Hobby'**

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Concept of 'Hobby':** This is a common concept in Indian culture, even if not always explicitly called "hobby." Children often engage in recreational activities. Most students will understand what a hobby is.
*   **Basic English Vocabulary:** Words like "favourite," "hobby," "write," "paragraph," "mention," "when," "why," "enjoy" are expected at a Class 7 level, especially for those who have been learning English for several years. "Sentence" is also basic.
*   **Paragraph Structure:** This is where it gets tricky. Students are taught about paragraphs, but *writing* a coherent one with a specific sentence count (4-5) and covering specific points can be challenging. They might be more familiar with writing individual sentences or short, unconnected answers.
*   **Personal Experience:** Every student will have a 'favourite hobby' or at least an activity they enjoy. This is not knowledge that needs to be recalled from a textbook.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
*   **Vocabulary:** The core vocabulary is generally accessible. "Favourite" and "enjoy" might be slightly higher-level than strictly basic, but common in Class 7 textbooks.
*   **Sentence Construction:** This is the primary linguistic hurdle.
    *   **Simple Sentences:** Many students can form simple sentences (e.g., "My hobby is reading." "I read in the evening.").
    *   **Connecting Ideas:** The challenge is to connect these simple ideas into a coherent paragraph, using conjunctions (e.g., "and," "but," "because," "when") or transition words to explain *why* they enjoy it, *when* they do it, and what the hobby *is*.
    *   **Grammar:** Basic subject-verb agreement, tense (present simple is most likely needed), and prepositions will be tested. Errors in these areas are common.
    *   **Length Constraint (4-5 sentences):** This adds pressure. Too short means they miss points; too long might mean they struggle to maintain coherence or make more errors.
*   **Understanding the Prompt's Instructions:** "Write a short paragraph," "mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." This requires careful reading and understanding of multiple instructions within one prompt.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Application:** This is primarily an application task. Students need to apply their knowledge of English grammar and vocabulary to express personal information and structure it into a paragraph.
*   **Reasoning:** There's a minor element of reasoning in articulating *why* they enjoy their hobby, but it's more about expressing personal preference than complex logical deduction.
*   **Recall:** Minimal recall of factual information is needed, only of personal experiences.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easier:** Filling in the blanks, answering short questions based on a passage, matching words, naming pictures.
    *   **Similar (but often simpler):** "Write 3 sentences about your family." "Describe your pet." (Often without the paragraph structure or specific content points).
    *   **Harder:** Complex comprehension questions, writing longer essays on abstract topics, detailed grammar transformations.
*   **This Question:** It falls in the mid-range of difficulty. It's more complex than single-sentence answers but simpler than argumentative essays. The personal nature makes it accessible, but the structural demands (paragraph, specific points, sentence count) elevate it above basic sentence writing. Many textbooks have similar "composition" tasks, but the quality of output varies wildly. The "4-5 sentences" is a very specific constraint that might trip some students up, especially if they are only used to writing a few unconnected sentences.

**Likely Challenges:**
*   **Grammatical errors:** Tense, articles, prepositions will be common errors.
*   **Coherence:** Sentences might be somewhat disjointed rather than flowing smoothly into a paragraph.
*   **Adhering to sentence count:** Some might write only 2-3 sentences, others might write 6-7, struggling to meet the exact range.
*   **Addressing all points:** Students might forget to mention *when* they do it or only give a very basic "why" without elaboration.

Given the average pass rate of 29% across items and considering the specific challenges outlined above, this question is more demanding than a simple recall or single-sentence answer, but the subject matter is highly relatable
