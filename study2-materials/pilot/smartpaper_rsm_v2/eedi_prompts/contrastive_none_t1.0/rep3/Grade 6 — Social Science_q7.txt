Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographic knowledge:** Students need to know that Rajasthan is a state in India and have some basic understanding of its geography (e.g., desert region, mineral deposits). This is generally covered in Class 5/6 Social Studies textbooks (Our India/States of India chapters).
    *   **Definition of "natural resource":** They should understand that natural resources are things found in nature that humans use. This is a core concept introduced around this level.
    *   **Examples of natural resources:** They need to be able to identify specific examples relevant to Rajasthan.
    *   **Cause-and-effect relationship:** Understanding how a resource *influences* lives requires a basic grasp of cause and effect.

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   "**Mention any two natural resources...**": "Mention" is a common verb, generally understood. "Natural resources" is a key vocabulary term, likely introduced in textbooks.
    *   "**...found in Rajasthan...**": Straightforward.
    *   "**...and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.**": This is the more challenging part.
        *   "Explain how": Requires articulating a process or connection.
        *   "Influences": This word might be a bit more challenging for students with limited English. It means "affects" or "has an impact on."
        *   "Lives of the people there": Refers to daily activities, economy, culture.
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary is not overly complex, but "influences" is the potential stumbling block. The instruction to "explain how" pushes beyond simple recall.

3.  **Type of Task: Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **"Mention any two natural resources"**: Primarily **recall**. Students need to remember facts about Rajasthan's resources.
    *   **"explain how one of them influences the lives"**: This requires **application and basic reasoning**. They need to connect a known resource to its practical impact on people's lives. It's not just stating a fact; it's explaining a relationship.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Recall part:** Naming two resources is comparable to typical "fill in the blanks" or "name the following" exercises found in textbooks. These are usually considered easier.
    *   **Explanation part:** The "explain how it influences lives" elevates it beyond a simple recall question. Textbook questions often ask for "reasons why" or "short explanations," but sometimes these are more directly paraphrased from the text. This question requires a bit more synthesis and independent thought, connecting general knowledge to a specific context.
    *   **Compared to the average pass rate of 29% for all items:** This question is likely *harder* than average due to the explanation component and the potential ambiguity of "influences" for lower English proficiency students. Simple recall questions might have a higher pass rate, but those requiring explanation often bring it down. The fact that only "Max score: 1" is given for *both* parts suggests that simply naming two resources might not be enough if the explanation is poor or missing. However, if the rubric implies *any* two correct resources satisfy the "max score 1" criterion, it simplifies things significantly. Let's assume the rubric means "mentions two correct natural resources" is sufficient for the 1 mark, as "explain how one of them influences" is a complex instruction for a single mark question. If the explanation *is* required for the mark, the difficulty significantly increases. Given "Max score: 1" for *both* instructions, it's highly probable that just correctly listing two resources is enough to get the mark. The phrasing "Mentions two correct natural resources..." as the primary descriptor for the 1 mark strongly supports this interpretation.

**Revisiting the Rubric Interpretation:**
"Rubric: Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy). Max score: 1"

This rubric is CRUCIAL. If merely mentioning two correct resources gets the full 1 mark, then the "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there" part is essentially *optional* or implicitly fulfilled by naming common resources. For instance, naming "water" already inherently implies its influence in a desert state. If the mark is solely tied to naming two resources, the difficulty drops considerably.

Let's assume the most lenient interpretation, which is
