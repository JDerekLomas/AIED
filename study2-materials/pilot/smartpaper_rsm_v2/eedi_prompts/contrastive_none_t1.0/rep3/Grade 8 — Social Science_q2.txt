Let's break down the question for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Hard:** Students need to have studied the Harappan Civilization in their Social Science curriculum. While it's a fundamental topic, the depth of coverage can vary. Merely knowing *of* it isn't enough; they need to recall specific *features*.
    *   **Easy:** The Harappan Civilization is a cornerstone of ancient Indian history and is typically covered in Class 6 or 7, and often revisited or reinforced in Class 8. So, the topic itself shouldn't be entirely new.

*   **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Hard:**
        *   "Describe": This requires more than just identifying a term; it demands a brief explanation.
        *   "Key feature": This implies distinguishing significant characteristics from minor details.
        *   "Urban planning": This is a slightly more academic term. While students might understand "city design," "urban planning" requires a slightly higher vocabulary level.
        *   "Harappan Civilization": While a proper noun, if they haven't encountered it specifically in English, it might be a hurdle, especially if their history lessons were primarily in Hindi.
    *   **Easy:** The sentence structure is relatively straightforward (Subject-Verb-Object). It's not a complex compound or conditional sentence.

*   **Type of Cognitive Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **Recall:** This is almost entirely a recall question. Students need to remember specific facts about Harappan urban planning as taught in their textbooks. There's very little application or reasoning required beyond recalling the information.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Hard:**
        *   Typical textbook exercises might be multiple-choice ("Which of these was *not* a feature...?"), fill-in-the-blanks, or short answer questions that directly ask for a list. This question, "Describe one key feature," requires them to synthesize information and articulate it, even if briefly.
        *   It doesn't provide any prompts or options, which can be challenging for weaker students.
    *   **Easy:**
        *   Many textbook exercises *do* ask for descriptive answers, so the format isn't entirely alien.
        *   The rubric accepts a single, simple feature, which is not an overly demanding response. For example, "They had good drainage" would likely get full marks.

**Overall Assessment:**

The question deals with a core historical topic that students *should* have learned. However, the language demands, particularly "describe" and "urban planning," combined with the need to recall a specific feature without prompts, elevate its difficulty. The average pass rate of 29% suggests that even basic recall questions in English can be challenging.

While the content is foundational, the formulation in English, requiring a descriptive answer, makes it moderately difficult for students with limited English and from economically weaker sections. Many might struggle to formulate a coherent sentence even if they know the information in Hindi. "Drainage system," "grid pattern," "baked bricks" are all relatively simple concepts, but expressing them clearly in English is the hurdle.

Given the 29% average pass rate, this question is likely to fall on the higher side of that average, but not by a huge margin because it's a core concept. Many students might recognize "Harappan" but fail to produce a relevant "key feature" or struggle with the English phrasing.
