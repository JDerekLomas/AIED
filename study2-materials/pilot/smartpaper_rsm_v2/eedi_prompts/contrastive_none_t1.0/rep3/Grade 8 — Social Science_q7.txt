Let's break down the question and estimate the proportion of correct answers.

**Contrastive Analysis of the Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Specific:** Students need to know about the Battle of Plassey (1757), its participants (British, Nawab of Bengal), and its immediate aftermath. This is standard Class 8 Indian Social Science curriculum (History).
    *   **General:** Basic understanding of terms like "expansion of power," "political dominance," "control," "puppet nawab." These are common historical concepts.
    *   **Implicit:** Knowledge of the East India Company's presence and early aims in India.

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   "How did... contribute to..." - This requires understanding a causal link. While common, it's slightly more complex than a direct "What was...?" or "When was...?" question.
    *   "Expansion of British power" - "Expansion" might be a moderate challenge, but "British power" is clear.
    *   "Contribute" - This is the most crucial verb and could be challenging for students with very limited English to grasp the full nuance of "leading to" or "playing a role in." They might understand it as "What happened after?" rather than "How did it cause/enable?".
    *   The core concepts needed for the answer ("political dominance," "control over Bengal," "puppet nawab") are fairly specific English terms. While these concepts are taught in Hindi, the direct English equivalents might not be immediately obvious or perfectly recalled.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   Primarily **Recall:** Students are expected to recall the *consequence* of the Battle of Plassey.
    *   **Implicit Reasoning/Understanding:** To answer correctly, they need to have understood the *significance* of Plassey beyond just "British won." They need to understand *why* winning Plassey was important for British power, not just *that* they won. This moves it slightly beyond pure factual recall to understanding a historical cause-and-effect.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Medium-High:**
        *   It's not a simple recall of a date or a person.
        *   It requires understanding a causal relationship ("contribute to").
        *   It asks for the *impact* or *significance*, which is often a higher-order thinking skill than just "List the events."
        *   Typical textbook questions might ask: "When was the Battle of Plassey?" "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?" "What was the result of the Battle of Plassey?" This question goes a step further by asking about the *contribution to a broader trend*.
        *   The correct answer (political dominance over Bengal, puppet nawab) is a key takeaway from the chapter on Plassey, so it is central content.

**Synthesis of Difficulty Factors:**

*   **Favorable:** The Battle of Plassey is a very significant and universally taught topic in Class 8 history. The core information needed for the answer (British control of Bengal, puppet Nawab) is a central concept.
*   **Challenging:**
    *   The phrasing "How did X contribute to Y?" requires understanding a causal link, which is more demanding than simple factual recall.
    *   Language demands for "contribute" and "expansion of power" could trip up students with limited English, even if they know the historical facts in Hindi.
    *   Students might recall the British victory but struggle to articulate its *political consequence* in the specific English terms expected by the rubric, especially without deeper comprehension of the English vocabulary. They might give a partial answer like "British won" or "British got rich" (economic aspect), which wouldn't fully hit the rubric's "political dominance/control" criteria.

Given the average pass rate of 29% for other items, and considering this question's specific demands:

*   Many will know *of* Plassey.
*   Fewer will articulate its *political impact* clearly in English.
*   Some will provide incomplete or partially correct answers that don't meet the rubric's specifics (e.g., mentioning economic gains rather than political control).
*   The language barrier for "contribute" and the specific terminology for the answer ("political dominance," "puppet nawab") will be significant hurdles.

Taking all this into account, it's harder than a simple recall but the topic is fundamental.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%**

This estimate is slightly *below* the average pass rate of 29% because of the nuanced causal question ("How did... contribute to...") and the specific vocabulary required for
