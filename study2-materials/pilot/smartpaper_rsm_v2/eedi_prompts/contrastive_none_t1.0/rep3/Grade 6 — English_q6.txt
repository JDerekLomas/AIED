Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their typical background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** The most fundamental assumption is that the student has read and understood the *poem itself*. Without comprehension, selecting a line and explaining a preference becomes impossible. This is a significant hurdle, as poetry can be abstract and even simple vocabulary in a poetic context can be challenging.
    *   **Concept of "Like":** While seemingly basic, articulating *why* one likes something requires a level of self-reflection and analytical thought about one's own emotional or intellectual response.
    *   **Basic Opinion Formulation:** Students need to understand that their personal opinion is being asked for and that there isn't a single "correct" answer. This is often less common in traditional rote-learning environments where factual recall is prioritized.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **"Which line...":** This is a fairly straightforward interrogative, likely understood.
    *   **"...from the poem...":** Again, likely understood.
    *   **"...do you like the most...":** "Like" is a high-frequency verb, so likely understood. "Most" for superlative is also generally common. The phrasing "do you like the most" is standard.
    *   **"...and why?":** This is the crucial part. "Why" demands explanation. Students need to be able to formulate a reason in English. Even if they understand the question, generating a coherent *sentence or two* of explanation can be a major challenge.
        *   They might understand *why* in their native language, but lack the vocabulary or grammatical structures in English to express it.
        *   Common simple reasons (e.g., "It is beautiful," "It tells a good story," "I like the words") might be within reach, but more nuanced reasons would be very difficult.
    *   **Vocabulary from the poem:** The difficulty of the question is inherently tied to the vocabulary and complexity of the *poem itself*. If the poem uses difficult words, understanding and then explaining a preference for a line becomes exponentially harder.
    *   **Writing vs. Speaking:** This is likely an written exam. Writing requires more precise grammar and spelling than informal speaking, adding another layer of difficulty for students with limited English.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Not directly recall. Students need to recall the poem's content but not simply regurgitate it.
    *   **Application:** It's an application of comprehension and personal response. They apply their understanding of the poem and their emotional/intellectual reaction to form an opinion.
    *   **Reasoning:** Primarily reasoning, specifically **personal reasoning/justification**. They need to articulate the *reasons* for their preference. This moves beyond basic comprehension into higher-order thinking, even if the reasoning is simple.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Higher Difficulty:** This question is significantly harder than typical recall-based exercises ("Who is the main character?", "What happened next?").
    *   **Opinion-Based:** Many traditional Indian government school textbooks, especially at this level, focus heavily on factual questions, fill-in-the-blanks, matching, and very direct comprehension questions that have a single "correct" answer. Questions requiring personal opinion and justification are less common and therefore less practiced.
    *   **Open-Ended:** The open-ended nature means students can't just pick from a list; they have to generate the entire response themselves.

**Specific Challenges for the Target Group:**

*   **Limited Exposure to Poetry Analysis:** Students are likely not regularly asked to analyze or express personal preferences about poetry in English.
*   **Emphasis on Rote Learning:** The educational system often emphasizes memorization, which trains students away from expressing personal opinions or justifications.
*   **Confidence in English Expression:** Many students will lack the confidence to attempt an open-ended question in English, fearing errors. They might understand the poem and have a favorite line, but be unable to articulate *why* in English.
*   **"Why" is the Bottleneck:** Most students might be able to identify a line (even if randomly). The "and why" part is where the vast majority will fail to score. Even a simple "because it is good" might be accepted, but constructing anything more complex will be rare.

**Rubric Consideration (Max score: 1.5, Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why):**

*   **"Denotes a line":** This is relatively easier. Even if comprehension is weak,
