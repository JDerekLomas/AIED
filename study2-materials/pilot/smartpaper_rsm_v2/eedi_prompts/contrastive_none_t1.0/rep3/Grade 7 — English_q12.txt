Let's break down the question for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the given context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammar:** Students are expected to understand the concepts of "active voice" and "passive voice." This is typically introduced around Class 6 or 7 in Indian curricula, so they might have encountered it. However, the *depth* of understanding and ability to *apply* it can vary widely.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Basic subject-verb-object identification.
    *   **Verb Forms:** Knowledge of past participle forms (e.g., 'blown' for 'blew'). This is a significant hurdle.
    *   **Vocabulary:** 'Wind,' 'blew,' 'leaves,' 'away.' These are common words and unlikely to be an issue.

*   **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Instructions:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice." This instruction itself contains two technical grammatical terms ("Active Voice," "Passive Voice") that might be confusing if they haven't been thoroughly taught in English, or if their understanding is primarily in Hindi. They might know the *concept* but not the *English terminology*.
    *   **Sentence Comprehension:** "The wind blew the leaves away." The sentence itself is simple and uses basic vocabulary, so comprehension of the *meaning* is low difficulty.
    *   **Grammatical Transformation:** The actual process of changing the voice requires understanding which part becomes the subject, which verb form to use, and adding 'by'. This is where the English proficiency becomes critical for applying the *rules* learned, which might have been taught with Hindi explanations.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application**. Students need to recall the rules for transforming active to passive voice and then apply them to a given sentence. It's not pure recall (like defining active voice) nor complex reasoning.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a *standard* type of exercise found in Class 7 English grammar textbooks in India for the topic of active/passive voice. The sentence itself is quite straightforward, without complex tenses or multiple clauses.
    *   However, the *average pass rate across items being 29%* suggests that even "typical" exercises might be challenging for this cohort. This specific question is one of the more common and fundamental applications of the topic.
    *   The biggest "gotcha" for these students will likely be:
        1.  Understanding the instruction in English.
        2.  Correctly identifying the subject, verb, and object in the *active* sentence.
        3.  Knowing the correct past participle form of "blew" (blown). Many might write "was blowed" or similar errors.
        4.  Correctly forming the "was/were + past participle" structure.
        5.  Remembering to add "by the wind" (though this part is often optional for a "correct" answer in many contexts, the rubric specifies it).

**Synthesized Difficulty:**

The conceptual knowledge of active/passive voice might exist in their regional language, but applying it *in English* with the correct terminology and verb forms is the main barrier. The sentence itself is simple. The instruction is technical. The requirement of a specific past participle ("blown") is a common error point for English language learners.

Given the 29% average pass rate across items, this particular question, while standard, still presents significant hurdles. Students who understand the concept but struggle with English vocabulary or verb conjugations will falter.

*   A proportion will understand the concept and execute it perfectly.
*   A proportion will understand the concept but make errors in verb form ("were blowed") or omit "by the wind."
*   A proportion will not understand the instruction or the concept.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%**

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   It's a foundational grammar topic, so a decent chunk of students would have been taught it.
*   The sentence is simple, reducing vocabulary comprehension issues.
*   However, the technical English terms in the instruction and the need for correct verb forms (especially irregular ones like "blew" -> "blown") will trip up a significant number of students, even those with some conceptual understanding.
*   It's slightly above the average pass rate (29%) because it's a very common, straightforward application of a key grammar rule. It's not a higher-order thinking question or one with complex vocabulary/sentence structure. But it's not "easy" given the overall context of limited English proficiency.
