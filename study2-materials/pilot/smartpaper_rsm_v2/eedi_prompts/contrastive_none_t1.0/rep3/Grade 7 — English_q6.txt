Let's break down the question and its demands on Class 7 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis of "Describes the poet’s writing style"**

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Implicit:** The student needs to have read a poem (or poems) from which they are expected to extract the "writing style." The question itself doesn't provide the poem, so it assumes the student has just finished reading one.
*   **Concept of "Poet":** Basic understanding that a poet is someone who writes poems. Likely known.
*   **Concept of "Writing Style":** This is the crucial conceptual hurdle. Do Class 7 students in this context have a developed understanding of what "writing style" entails, especially for poetry?
    *   They might understand "good handwriting" or "grammar" as part of how someone writes, but abstract concepts like "descriptive," "informal," "direct," "figurative," "simple" as *characteristics of style* are more advanced.
    *   Poetry analysis, beyond identifying rhymes or simple themes, is often introduced later or given less emphasis than prose comprehension.
    *   Their exposure to different *styles* of poetry might be limited, making it hard to differentiate and label.
*   **Vocabulary for "Style":** Even if they grasp the concept, do they have the English vocabulary (like "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct," "figurative," "emotive," "narrative") to articulate it?

**2. Language Demands (on students with limited English):**

*   **"Describes":** This is a fairly common verb, likely understood.
*   **"Poet's":** Possessive form, also likely understood.
*   **"Writing style":** This is the most demanding phrase.
    *   "Writing" is common.
    *   "Style" is the difficult word. While "style" itself might be known in other contexts (e.g., "fashion style"), its specific application to literary expression is abstract. Students might confuse it with "manner" or "method" in a very literal sense.
    *   The combination "writing style" requires a nuanced understanding of how words are used to convey meaning and create an effect.
*   **Rubric Demands:** The rubric's example words ("simple, descriptive, informal, direct") are all relatively common adjectives, but applying them precisely to *writing style* is the challenge. "Descriptive" is probably the most accessible, as students often learn to identify descriptions. "Informal" and "direct" might be harder to distinguish, especially in the context of poetry which often has its own conventions.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   This is primarily **application and reasoning**, with a significant element of **conceptual understanding**.
    *   It's not recall, as the answer isn't directly stated in any text.
    *   It requires applying a conceptual framework ("writing style") to an observed text (the poem, which is implicitly present).
    *   It also involves reasoning about *how* the poet used language and then abstracting that into a descriptive term.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **More difficult** than typical Class 7 English exercises in this context.
    *   Typical exercises often focus on:
        *   Direct comprehension questions (Who, What, When, Where).
        *   Identifying main ideas or themes (often explicitly stated or easily inferable).
        *   Vocabulary definitions or usage (matching, filling blanks).
        *   Grammar exercises (tenses, parts of speech).
    *   Analyzing "writing style" requires a higher-order thinking skill—abstraction and critical analysis—that is usually introduced or emphasized more in later grades (Class 8-9) or in more advanced English curricula.
    *   Even if they encounter poems, questions are more likely to be about the poem's message, characters, or rhyme scheme, rather than the author's stylistic choices.

**Overall Difficulty Assessment:**

The core difficulty lies in the abstract concept of "writing style" and the ability to articulate it using appropriate English vocabulary. Given the limited English proficiency and focus on basic comprehension, this question probes an area that might not be deeply covered or easily grasped. Students might resort to generic answers like "good writing" or struggle to find a specific descriptor. "Simple" might be an accessible choice if the poem itself is simple, but even that requires a judgment. "Descriptive" might also be chosen if the poem contains vivid imagery.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

This question feels harder than an average item, pushing beyond basic comprehension. The abstract nature of "writing style"
