Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, followed by an estimated proportion correct:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Basic understanding of "rural areas," "occupations," and "Rajasthan" as an Indian state. Knowledge of common economic activities in rural India.
    *   **Likely Possessed:** Students, even from economically weaker sections, are very likely familiar with "rural areas" and the concept of "occupations" from their own lives and observations. They would have studied Rajasthan as a state in their geography/social science curriculum. The primary occupations in rural India (agriculture, animal husbandry) are extremely common knowledge.
    *   **Less Likely Possessed (but not critical for naming):** Detailed knowledge of *all* specific types of handicrafts or *all* nuances of animal husbandry in Rajasthan, though they would know the general idea.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Keywords:** "main occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," "describe in brief."
    *   **Difficulty Level:** The vocabulary is quite straightforward and commonly encountered in social science textbooks and daily conversation, even in English with limited proficiency. "Main occupations" is a direct and simple phrase. "Rural areas" is also very common. "Describe in brief" is a standard instruction.
    *   **Comparison to Typical:** This is simpler than many English-medium social science questions that might use more abstract concepts or complex sentence structures. The lack of an option to answer in Hindi is a barrier for some, but the core terms are highly cognate or easily understood.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **Primary Mode:** Primarily **recall**. Students are expected to recall facts about the economy of rural Rajasthan.
    *   **Secondary Mode (for "describe"):** A very basic level of **description/brief explanation**, which also relies heavily on recalled facts rather than complex reasoning or application to new scenarios.
    *   **Difficulty:** Recall questions are generally easier than application or reasoning questions, especially when the information is fundamental and repeatedly covered.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Level:** This question is very similar to a "short answer" or "fill in the blanks" type question that would appear at the end of a chapter on "Life in Rural Areas" or "Geography of Rajasthan" in a Class 7 Social Science textbook.
    *   **Difficulty:** It's on the easier side of typical textbook exercises because it asks for widely known and fundamental information. It doesn't require synthesizing multiple concepts, interpreting data, or solving a problem. The "describe in brief" part is also not very demanding; a simple sentence or two would suffice.

**Factors making it easier:**

1.  **High Salience:** Agriculture and animal husbandry are *the* defining characteristics of rural life in most of India, and especially in Rajasthan, which has a significant desert/arid region where animal rearing is crucial. Students would be exposed to this repeatedly in their curriculum and often in their personal lives.
2.  **Simple Vocabulary:** The English used is basic and direct.
3.  **Direct Recall:** It's a factual recall question.
4.  **Low Bar for "Describe":** "In brief" allows for a very simple, single-sentence description, not an in-depth analysis.
5.  **No Complex Concepts:** No abstract ideas, just concrete economic activities.

**Factors making it harder:**

1.  **English Medium:** For students in Hindi-medium schools, even simple English can be a barrier. However, "occupation," "rural," "Rajasthan," "agriculture," "farming," "animal husbandry" are words they would likely have encountered or be able to infer.
2.  **Specificity of Rajasthan:** While general rural occupations are known, the explicit mention of "Rajasthan" requires them to link those general concepts to a specific state, which might be a minor challenge if their state-specific geography is weak. However, agriculture and animal husbandry are still the dominant answers.

**Conclusion:**

This question targets very fundamental knowledge about rural life and the economy, which is a core part of the Class 7 Social Science curriculum. The language is simple, and the task is direct recall. While the English medium is a hurdle, the content is so universally known within the Indian context that many students would likely recognize the key terms and be able to provide at least two correct occupations, even if the "describe in brief" part is less elaborate.

Given the average pass rate across items is 29%, this specific question is significantly easier than the average due to its directness and highly salient content.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%**
