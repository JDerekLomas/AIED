Let's break down the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." for Class 7 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of 'hobby':** Most Class 7 students would have a basic understanding of what a hobby is, even if they use a Hindi equivalent like 'shauk' or 'pasandida kaam'. This concept is universally relatable.
    *   **Basic paragraph structure:** They would have been taught what a paragraph is (a group of sentences about one main idea) in their Hindi or English classes.
    *   **Common verbs/tenses:** They would need to use simple present tense primarily, along with common verbs related to activities (play, read, draw, listen, etc.).
    *   **Personal expression:** The ability to articulate personal preferences and reasons for enjoyment. This is a common theme in primary and middle school essays/writing tasks in various languages.

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Favourite Hobby": These are common words. "Favourite" might be challenging to spell but its meaning is generally understood. "Hobby" is often introduced early in English classes.
        *   "Paragraph," "sentences": These are standard instructional terms.
        *   "Mention": Understand the instruction to include specific points.
        *   "When you do it," "why you enjoy it": These require simple sentence construction using conjunctions like 'because' or expressing time.
    *   **Sentence Structure:**
        *   They need to form simple declarative sentences.
        *   Connecting ideas: They need to link ideas logically within the paragraph (e.g., "My hobby is reading. I do it in the evening. I enjoy it because...").
    *   **Length:** "4-5 sentences" is a very manageable length. It's not intimidatingly long.
    *   **Idiomatic expressions/complex grammar:** There are *none* required. This is a huge advantage.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application:** It's primarily an application task. Students need to apply their basic English writing skills to a personal topic.
    *   **Recall:** They recall vocabulary and basic sentence structures.
    *   **Reasoning:** Limited reasoning, mainly just articulating personal preferences ("why you enjoy it"). It doesn't require complex analytical or critical thinking.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Difficulty:** This question is likely *easier* than many typical textbook grammar or comprehension exercises that might involve complex sentences, unseen passages, or more abstract topics.
    *   **Relatability:** The topic ('My Favourite Hobby') is highly relatable and personal, which often makes it easier for students to engage with and write about, even with limited language skills. They don't need to learn new content to answer; they just need to express existing personal information.
    *   **Scaffolding:** The prompt provides excellent scaffolding by explicitly stating *what* to include ("what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it"). This reduces ambiguity and helps students structure their thoughts.
    *   **Focus:** It tests basic communicative writing, not complex grammar rules or advanced vocabulary.

**Factors making it easier:**

*   **Personal topic:** Students *know* the content (their own hobby).
*   **Clear instructions:** The 'what, when, why' breakdown is very helpful.
*   **Simple vocabulary required.**
*   **Short length constraint (4-5 sentences).**
*   **No complex grammar or abstract concepts.**
*   **Common essay topic:** Students might have practiced similar topics in Hindi or even simple English 'My...' essays.

**Factors making it harder:**

*   **Writing in English:** This is the primary hurdle. Even simple English writing can be difficult for students with limited proficiency.
*   **Spelling:** Errors in spelling common words might be frequent.
*   **Sentence construction:** Grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency) are expected.
*   **Rubric strictness:** "Clearly mentions" and "complete paragraph" mean they need to hit all points and link sentences somewhat. A single sentence answer, or an answer missing one of the three points, would likely score 0.

**Overall Assessment:**

Given the average pass rate of 29% for other items, this question feels like one that would likely have a higher pass rate. Its personal nature and explicit scaffolding reduce many of the cognitive and linguistic burdens typical of academic English tasks. Students can draw on their personal experience, which is
