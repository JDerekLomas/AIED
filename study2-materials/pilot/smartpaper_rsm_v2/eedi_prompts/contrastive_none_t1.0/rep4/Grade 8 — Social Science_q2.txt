Let's break down the question for a Class 8 student in an Indian government school.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Existence of Harappan Civilization:** This is standard Class 6/7 Social Science (History) curriculum in India, often covered under "Ancient Civilizations" or "Indus Valley Civilization." Students should have been introduced to it.
    *   **Basic understanding of "urban planning":** While they might not use the term regularly, they would understand "city arrangements" or "how cities were built."
    *   **Specific features of Harappan cities:** This is the core knowledge. Textbooks typically highlight features like the grid system, drainage, baked bricks, and the citadel/lower town. These are usually presented as distinguishing characteristics.
    *   **Recall vs. Detailed Description:** The question asks to "describe one key feature." This means recall of the feature and a very brief explanation of what it entails.

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **"Describe":** A common instruction word, usually understood.
    *   **"Key feature":** Fairly straightforward, meaning an important characteristic.
    *   **"Harappan Civilization":** This is a proper noun they would have encountered.
    *   **"Urban planning":** This is the trickiest term. It might not be immediately obvious. Students might understand "city design" or "how cities were built" more readily. However, the context of the question following "Harappan Civilization" might help them infer it relates to the cities.
    *   **Expected answer phrasing:** Students might struggle to articulate a description in perfect English. For example, instead of "well-planned grid layout of streets," they might write "roads straight." The rubric's flexibility ("Correctly describes one key feature, such as...") is crucial here.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **recall** of factual information. Students are expected to remember specific attributes of Harappan cities taught in their history lessons.
    *   There's a very minimal element of **application** in choosing *one key* feature from several they might know.
    *   No complex reasoning is required beyond identifying and stating a feature.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical exercises:** Textbooks often have fill-in-the-blanks, multiple-choice, or short-answer questions like "Name two features of Harappan cities" or "What was special about the drainage system of Harappa?"
    *   **This question:** "Describe one key feature" is a standard short-answer format. It's slightly more open-ended than "Name one," but less demanding than "Explain the significance of..." It aligns well with what's expected for Class 8 recall.
    *   **Challenge:** The difficulty for these students will primarily come from two areas:
        1.  **Recall itself:** Even if taught, retention of historical facts can vary greatly.
        2.  **English articulation:** Expressing the recalled fact clearly in English, especially for a term like "grid layout" or "citadel and lower town," will be challenging. However, if they just write "good drainage" or "straight roads," that should count based on the rubric.

**Considering the overall context:**

*   **Economically weaker sections:** This can impact access to supplementary learning materials, consistent schooling, and parental support for studies, potentially affecting recall.
*   **Hindi-medium schools, limited English proficiency:** This is the biggest hurdle. The actual *knowledge* might be there in Hindi, but translating it into understandable English is tough.
*   **Average pass rate (29%):** This is a low baseline, suggesting significant challenges across the board. While this is Social Science, which often has higher recall rates than Maths or Science for this demographic, the English barrier will pull it down.

**Potential Student Responses & Rubric Application:**

*   **High-scoring:** "Harappan cities had a very advanced drainage system." or "The cities were divided into two parts: a citadel and a lower town."
*   **Mid-scoring (likely still correct):** "Good drainage system." "Roads were straight." "Bricks were baked." "Cities had two parts." (These should be accepted by the rubric's flexibility).
*   **Low-scoring/Incorrect:** Blank, irrelevant information, or answers too vague to be considered a description (e.g., "cities were good").

**Synthesizing and Estimating:**

Many students will have *some* knowledge of Harappan features. The common ones (drainage, grid roads, bricks, two-part cities) are usually well-emphasized. The main barrier
