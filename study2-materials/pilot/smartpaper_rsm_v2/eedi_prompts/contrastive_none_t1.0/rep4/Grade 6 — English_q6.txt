Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their typical background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** The core assumption is that the student has read and understood the poem, at least to a basic level, to form an opinion about specific lines. This is a significant hurdle if the poem itself is complex or uses unfamiliar vocabulary/idioms. For the purpose of *this question*, we'll assume basic comprehension of the *poem's content* has been achieved.
    *   **Subjective Opinion:** Students need to understand that their personal preference is being asked for, not a factual recall from the poem. This is a common academic skill, but for students unaccustomed to expressing personal opinions in formal settings, it might be less straightforward than factual recall.
    *   **Causal Reasoning (Implicit "Why"):** They need to be able to articulate a reason for their preference. This requires a basic understanding of cause-and-effect or justification. "I like it because it sounds nice" or "because it reminds me of something" are valid reasons, but formulating them in English can be challenging.

*   **Language Demands (with Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Which line...":** Relatively straightforward. "Line" is a common word.
    *   **"...from the poem...":** Again, straightforward. "Poem" is a core vocabulary word for this context.
    *   **"...do you like the most...":** This phrase is common and likely understood. "Like" is fundamental, "most" indicates a superlative choice.
    *   **"...and why?":** This is where the language demand significantly increases.
        *   Students need to retrieve a specific line from the poem (potentially needing to write it out or refer to it).
        *   They then need to formulate a *reason* for their liking, which requires using connecting words (e.g., "because," "so that," "when") and descriptive vocabulary.
        *   For example, "I like this line because it uses good words" or "I like this line because it makes me happy." Even simple reasons require some sentence construction beyond just naming.
        *   Many students might struggle to translate their internal thought process ("I like it because it feels nice") into coherent English sentences. They might resort to very short, unelaborated answers or even just restate the line without a reason.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Partial. They need to recall a line from the poem.
    *   **Application:** Minimal. No complex application of rules or formulas.
    *   **Reasoning:** High. The "why" demands basic causal reasoning and justification of a personal preference. This moves beyond simple factual recall and into higher-order thinking, even if the reasoning itself is simple.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical exercises:** Often focus on factual recall (e.g., "Who is the main character?", "What happened next?"), vocabulary matching, or simple sentence completion.
    *   **This question:** Is more open-ended and subjective. While some textbooks might include "think and discuss" questions, written answers requiring justification of personal preference are generally less common than factual comprehension checks, especially at this level and in these school environments.
    *   **Challenge:** The open-ended nature and the demand for justification make it harder than a typical recall question. Students might feel uncertain about *what kind* of answer is expected for the "why" part, especially if they are more accustomed to single, correct factual answers.

**Summary of Difficulty Factors:**

*   **High:** "Why" component requires formulating a reasoned justification in English, which is a significant barrier for limited English proficiency.
*   **Moderate:** Understanding that a subjective opinion is being asked for.
*   **Low:** Basic understanding of "which line," "poem," "like the most."

**Considering the Average Pass Rate of 29% for other items:**

This question is likely *harder* than a typical recall question that might contribute to that 29% average. The "why" pushes it into a higher cognitive demand category and significantly increases the linguistic burden.

**Rubric Analysis:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why."
*   This is a generous rubric. "Mentions why" doesn't require complex reasoning, just *any* reason.
*   However, getting *any* reason articulated in English is the key hurdle.
*   Simply writing the line without a "why" would likely not receive full credit.
*   Simply saying "I
