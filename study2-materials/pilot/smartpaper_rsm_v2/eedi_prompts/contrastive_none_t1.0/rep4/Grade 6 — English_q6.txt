Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their typical background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poetry Comprehension:** Students need to have read and understood the poem. This is the foundational assumption. The difficulty of *this* question is heavily dependent on the poem itself. If the poem is abstract, uses complex vocabulary, or deals with unfamiliar concepts, then understanding it will be the primary barrier. For the purpose of *this specific question*, let's assume the poem itself is at an appropriate Class 6 level in terms of theme and general comprehension (though vocabulary might still be challenging).
    *   **Emotional/Subjective Response:** Students need to be comfortable expressing a personal preference ("which line do you like the most"). This isn't purely academic recall. It requires introspection and the ability to articulate a feeling.
    *   **Causal Reasoning (Simple):** The "why" part requires a simple cause-and-effect or justification. They need to connect their liking to a specific aspect of the line (e.g., "it sounds nice," "it reminds me of X," "it makes me feel Y").

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Which": Straightforward, interrogative.
        *   "line": Basic vocabulary, likely understood in context of a poem.
        *   "poem": Basic vocabulary.
        *   "like": Very common verb, likely known.
        *   "most": Superlative, common.
        *   "and why": Simple conjunction and interrogative adverb.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question itself is grammatically simple (Wh-question + conjunction + Wh-question).
    *   **Response Formulation:** This is where the challenge lies.
        *   *Identifying a line:* They need to be able to physically point to or transcribe/recite a line from the poem. This isn't too hard.
        *   *Articulating "why":* This requires generating a sentence or two in English to explain their preference. This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they understand *why* in their mother tongue (e.g., Hindi), translating that nuanced reason into appropriate English vocabulary and grammar can be very difficult. They might resort to very simple, repetitive phrases like "I like it" or "It is good" without elaborating on *why* it's good.
        *   The rubric "mentions why" is key. A simple "I like this line" won't suffice.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   It's primarily **reasoning** and **subjective expression**. It's not recall of facts from the poem. It's not a direct application of a grammatical rule or a formula. It requires them to engage personally with the text and articulate a justification. This can be harder than pure recall for students who are not accustomed to or confident in expressing personal opinions in a foreign language.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical exercises:** Often focus on recall (e.g., "Who is the main character?", "What happened after X?"), factual comprehension (e.g., "What is the capital of Y?"), or direct application of grammar rules (e.g., "Change to past tense"). These are usually easier for students with limited English as they often involve identifying specific words/phrases from the text or applying memorized rules.
    *   **This question:** Demands a personal, subjective response and articulation of reasoning. This is often *more challenging* than typical textbook exercises, especially for students who lack confidence in their spoken/written English or are not encouraged to express personal opinions in academic settings. It requires productive language skills rather than just receptive or transformative skills.

**Specific Challenges:**

1.  **Understanding the poem:** (External factor, but crucial) If the poem itself is hard, then answering this question correctly becomes impossible.
2.  **Vocabulary for "why":** Students might understand *why* they like a line in their native language, but lack the English vocabulary to express it effectively (e.g., words like "evocative," "melodious," "powerful," "relatable," "imagery," "rhythm"). They might default to very basic and insufficient reasons.
3.  **Grammar for "why":** Constructing a grammatically correct sentence or two to explain their reason, even with simple vocabulary, can be a struggle.
4.  **Confidence in subjective answers:** Students, especially from backgrounds where rote learning and objective answers are common, might be hesitant to give a subjective answer or worry about
