Let's break down the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the given context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** The most crucial prior knowledge is understanding the preceding reading passage (which describes the king's three questions: the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with). Without understanding these specific questions and their context, the student cannot answer this question meaningfully.
    *   **General World Knowledge/Life Experience:** The question asks if the king's questions are "important in real life." This requires a student to connect the abstract ideas from the story to their own understanding of the world and human decision-making. This is a common cognitive skill, but for students from economically weaker sections, their "real-life" experiences might be quite different from the "king's" concerns. However, the *essence* of the questions (making good decisions, choosing good people) is universal.
    *   **Concept of 'Importance':** While a basic concept, understanding what makes something "important" in a real-world context is required.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Do you think": Fairly common phrase.
        *   "king's questions": "King" is likely known from stories; "questions" is basic.
        *   "important": Very common word.
        *   "real life": Common idiom, usually understandable.
        *   "Give one reason": Basic instruction.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple declarative and interrogative structures. No complex clauses or inversions.
    *   **Abstractness:** The core difficulty here isn't individual words, but the abstract nature of connecting fictional questions to "real life." Students need to bridge the gap between story context and practical application.
    *   **Output Requirement:** "Give one reason" requires the student to formulate a coherent, albeit simple, English sentence expressing their justification. This is where limited English proficiency can become a significant barrier. They might *understand* the importance but struggle to articulate a reason in English. They might default to very simplistic answers like "Yes, it is good."
    *   **Rubric:** The rubric accepts "Any valid reason." This is helpful, as it doesn't demand sophisticated vocabulary or complex reasoning, just a clear link.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application and reasoning** question.
        *   **Recall:** Students need to recall what the king's questions *were* from the passage.
        *   **Application/Reasoning:** They then need to apply a judgment (is it important?) and provide reasoning for that judgment, connecting the king's abstract questions to practical life. It requires higher-order thinking than simple recall of facts from the passage.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Many Class 7 English textbook exercises focus on recall (e.g., "What were the three questions the king asked?"). This question goes beyond recall.
    *   **Open-ended Nature:** The "Give one reason" part is open-ended, which is often more challenging than multiple-choice or direct fact-finding questions. It demands productive language skills rather than just receptive ones.
    *   **Cultural Context:** While the story might be relatable, the act of reflecting on the "importance in real life" of a king's philosophical questions might be a step removed from very concrete, day-to-day exercises.
    *   **Likely Difficulty:** This question is likely *more difficult* than typical recall-based exercises due to the need for application, reasoning, and productive English output, despite the relatively simple vocabulary.

**Overall Assessment:**

The most significant hurdles will be:
1.  **Understanding the King's specific questions from the passage.** If the passage comprehension itself is weak, this question becomes impossible.
2.  **The abstract nature of linking "king's questions" to "real life."** While the concepts are universal, articulating that connection might be challenging.
3.  **Formulating a "reason" in English.** This is a productive skill that many students with limited English struggle with. They might have the thought but not the words. The *simplicity* of the acceptable reasons in the rubric ("e.g., to make good decisions, to avoid mistakes") is a saving grace here.

Given the average pass rate of 29% across items and the demand for reasoning and productive English, this question is likely to be on the harder side
