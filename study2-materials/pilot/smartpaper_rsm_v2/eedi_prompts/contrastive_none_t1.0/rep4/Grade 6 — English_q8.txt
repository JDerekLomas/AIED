Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the specified context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammar:** Basic understanding of English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object). This is typically introduced by Class 4 or 5 in English medium schools, and often by Class 6 even in Hindi medium schools for simple present continuous tense.
    *   **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely common (book, reading, a, is, he). These would likely be among the first English words learned.
    *   **Concept:** The action of "reading a book" is universally understood and relatable.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Task Understanding:** The phrase "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is the biggest linguistic hurdle. "Rearrange" and "meaningful sentence" are more advanced vocabulary than the words to be rearranged. Students might struggle with understanding the *instruction* even if they understand the individual words within the jumbled sentence.
    *   **Word Recognition:** The individual words themselves are very basic.
    *   **Syntactic Complexity:** The target sentence is a simple present continuous tense affirmative sentence, which is one of the foundational sentence structures taught. It's not complex.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** If they grasp the instruction, the cognitive load is low because the words are few and common, and the resulting sentence is simple.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of learned grammatical rules (SVO structure, present continuous tense formation). It requires a small amount of **reasoning** to identify the subject, verb, and object, and then put them in the correct order. It's not pure recall, as they aren't just memorizing a phrase.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Instructional Difficulty:** The instruction "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is a common type of exercise found in English textbooks from Class 4 onwards in India. However, the specific wording might be challenging if their textbook typically uses simpler instructions or gives examples.
    *   **Content Difficulty:** The actual words and the resulting sentence ("He is reading a book") are *very* basic and represent some of the simplest English content they would encounter. This is likely simpler than many other exercises that might involve more complex vocabulary, tenses, or sentence structures.
    *   **Visual/Contextual Clues:** There are no visual clues here, which sometimes helps students with limited English.

**Factors making it easier:**
*   Extremely common, simple vocabulary.
*   Simple, foundational sentence structure (SVO, present continuous).
*   Relatable concept (reading a book).
*   Only 5 words, so fewer permutations to consider if they're trying to guess.

**Factors making it harder:**
*   **Understanding the instruction itself:** "Rearrange" and "meaningful sentence" might be stumbling blocks. If they don't understand the task, they can't answer it.
*   Students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium schools often have very limited exposure to spoken English and may struggle with the abstract concept of sentence formation even if they know the individual words. Their English learning might be heavily focused on rote memorization rather than application.
*   The average pass rate across items is 29%, which suggests a generally low proficiency level. While this item *should* be easier than average, the baseline is very low.

**Conclusion on difficulty:**
This question presents a basic grammatical task with extremely simple content words. The primary challenge lies in interpreting the instructions, given their limited English proficiency. If a student understands "rearrange" and "sentence," the actual rearrangement is straightforward for someone who has received even minimal English grammar instruction on present continuous tense. Given the 29% average pass rate, this item is likely *easier* than average, but not trivially easy due to the instruction and general low proficiency.

Let's consider two groups:
1.  Those who understand the instruction: Many of them would likely get it right due to the simplicity of the sentence.
2.  Those who do *not* understand the instruction: They will almost certainly get it wrong.

The key is how many fall into group 1. Given it's Class 6, simple sentence formation should have been covered.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering the very basic nature of the sentence and words, but factoring in the "meaningful sentence" instruction challenge and the overall low proficiency (29% average pass rate), I'd estimate it significantly above the average, but not reaching a very high percentage due to instruction comprehension
