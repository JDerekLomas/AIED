Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students, followed by the estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have been taught about the Battle of Plassey (1757) as a key event in Indian history, particularly in the context of the rise of British power. They should know who fought, the outcome, and its immediate aftermath (e.g., Mir Jafar). This is standard Class 8 Social Science curriculum (History section).
    *   **Potentially Lacking:** While they might have "learned" it, the depth of understanding of *why* it was significant beyond a mere victory might vary. Connections to broader British expansion might be superficial. Understanding terms like "political dominance," "puppet nawab," or even "contribute to" might be challenging if not explicitly taught and reinforced.

2.  **Language Demands (English):**
    *   **Key terms:** "contribute to," "expansion," "political dominance," "puppet nawab."
        *   "Contribute to" can be tricky. Students might understand "what happened after" but struggle to articulate how it "helped" or "led to" the expansion.
        *   "Expansion" might be understood simply as "more power" or "more land."
        *   "Political dominance" is a sophisticated term. They might understand "control" but expressing "political" control specifically could be difficult.
        *   "Puppet nawab" is often taught as a specific concept and might be more accessible if they remember the term, but expressing its *significance* could be hard.
    *   **Sentence structure:** "How did X contribute to Y?" is a fairly standard question structure, but it requires a cause-and-effect understanding and expression, which can be harder than simple recall questions like "When was X?" or "Who fought in X?".
    *   **Medium:** Given they are mostly Hindi-medium students, the English phrasing itself is a significant barrier. Even if they know the historical facts in Hindi, translating and formulating a precise answer in English is a challenge.

3.  **Type of Cognitive Demand:**
    *   **Recall:** Yes, it requires recalling facts about the Battle of Plassey and its immediate aftermath.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** Crucially, it moves beyond mere recall. It asks *how* it contributed, demanding a basic level of cause-and-effect reasoning and understanding of historical significance. Students need to link the victory to the *consequences* for British power. This isn't just "What happened?" but "What was the *impact* of what happened on British power?"
    *   **Rubric Requirement:** "explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This clearly demands more than just naming Mir Jafar; it requires linking it to British control/dominance.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical textbook exercises for this level often include:
        *   Fill in the blanks (e.g., The Battle of Plassey was fought in ______).
        *   Match the following.
        *   Short answer recall (e.g., Who was the Nawab of Bengal during the Battle of Plassey?).
        *   "What were the causes/consequences of the Battle of Plassey?" - This question is closer to the "consequences" type, but specifically focuses on the "contribution to British power," which is a slightly more focused and analytical lens.
    *   This question is *harder* than basic recall. It requires synthesis and a minimal level of analytical thought (cause-effect) to explain the *how*. The need to articulate "political dominance" or "control over Bengal" goes beyond simply stating "British won" or "Mir Jafar became nawab."

**Synthesis of Difficulty:**

*   **Content:** The core event (Battle of Plassey) is standard and likely covered.
*   **Cognitive Demand:** The "how did it contribute" part elevates it from pure recall to basic reasoning/analysis, requiring students to articulate a connection between the event and its broader significance for British power. This is the primary difficulty.
*   **Language Barrier:** The English medium for Hindi-medium students, especially for terms like "contribute," "expansion," and "political dominance," is a significant additional hurdle. They might know the concept in Hindi but struggle to express it accurately and concisely in English.
*   **Rubric Precision:** The rubric demands an explanation of "political dominance/control over Bengal," not just a mention of Mir Jafar. This precision will filter out many who have a vague
