Let's break down the question and its demands on a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Question:** Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.
**Rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy).
Max score: 1

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographical Awareness:** Students need to know what Rajasthan is and have some basic understanding of its geography (e.g., desert region, mineral belt). This is generally covered in Class 5/6 Social Science (Geography section).
    *   **Definition of Natural Resources:** They need to understand what "natural resources" are. This is a fundamental concept taught from earlier classes.
    *   **Specific Resources of Rajasthan:** This is the most crucial piece of knowledge. Textbooks often list key resources of different states. Rajasthan is famous for certain minerals (marble, copper, zinc, gypsum, mica, sandstone, salt) and obviously, water (its scarcity being a defining feature). Sunlight and wind for energy are also relevant, though perhaps slightly more advanced concepts for Class 6 regarding "influence."
    *   **Cause-Effect Relationship:** The second part of the question requires understanding how a resource "influences" lives. This is a basic cause-effect relationship.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   "**Mention any two natural resources:**" "Mention" is a common verb. "Natural resources" is a key term, likely learned in English, even if the primary medium is Hindi. "Two" is simple.
    *   "**found in Rajasthan:**" Straightforward.
    *   "**explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there:**"
        *   "Explain how" requires descriptive language.
        *   "Influences" might be a slightly more challenging vocabulary word. They might understand it as "how it affects" or "how it changes."
        *   "Lives of the people there" is simple.
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary is within the expected range for Class 6 Social Science. The structure is a compound request (identify + explain). The biggest hurdle isn't the individual words, but the *depth of explanation* required for "influences," which might be difficult to articulate clearly in limited English. However, the rubric only requires *mentioning two resources* for the point, not the explanation part. This significantly reduces the language burden for scoring.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Identifying two natural resources is purely recall-based.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** Explaining the influence is an application of knowledge and requires some basic reasoning (connecting resource to livelihood/lifestyle).
    *   **Crucially, the rubric only awards points for "Mentions two correct natural resources."** This makes the scoring entirely recall-based. The explanation part, while asked, does not contribute to the score according to the provided rubric. This is a *major* simplification for the students in terms of achieving the point.

4.  **How it Compares in Difficulty to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Listing resources of a state is a very common type of question in Indian Social Science textbooks.
    *   Explaining the influence is also common, but usually, students might be expected to give simpler, direct answers (e.g., "Water scarcity leads to reliance on wells/canals," "Marble is used for construction and provides jobs").
    *   Given the rubric, this question is **easier than typical exercises** because it only requires recall of two items. Many textbook exercises would expect more detailed explanations for a full point. The average pass rate of 29% across items suggests that even basic recall can be challenging for some.

**Revised Analysis based on Rubric:** The rubric makes this question *much* easier than the full question implies. Students only need to recall two resources to get the point. They do not need to attempt the explanation part for a score.

**Factors for Estimation:**

*   **Geographical Content:** Rajasthan is a prominent state, and its resources are a common topic. Many students will have heard of things like marble, copper, salt, or the general scarcity of water.
*   **Recall vs. Explanation:** The rubric making it purely recall is a huge advantage.
*   **Limited English:** While the words are generally accessible, forming a complete sentence in English for the explanation part could be hard. But again, not required for a score.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** These
