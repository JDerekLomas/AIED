Let's break down the question and its demands on Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their specific context.

**Contrastive Analysis of the Question:**

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Definition of "Natural Resources":** Students need to understand what constitutes a natural resource. This is a core concept taught in Class 6 Social Science (Geography usually).
*   **Geography of Rajasthan:** They need to know that Rajasthan is a state in India and have some basic understanding of its physical environment to recall specific resources. This would typically be covered in regional geography chapters.
*   **Basic Cause-and-Effect:** To explain the influence, they need to grasp simple causal relationships between a resource and human life.

**2. Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
*   **"Mention":** Relatively straightforward.
*   **"Natural Resources":** Key vocabulary. While the concept is taught, the English term might be a hurdle for some. They might know the Hindi equivalent (प्राकृतिक संसाधन - Prakritik Sansadhan).
*   **"Found in Rajasthan":** Clear.
*   **"Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** This is the most complex part of the language demand.
    *   "Influences": A higher-level vocabulary word. Students might understand "affect" or "impact" more readily.
    *   "Lives of the people": Clear, but linking the resource to the *impact on daily life* requires more than just naming it.
    *   "There": Refers back to Rajasthan.

**3. Type of Cognitive Task:**
*   **Recall (for "mention any two natural resources"):** This is a direct recall task. If they've studied Rajasthan's resources, they should be able to list them.
*   **Application/Reasoning (for "explain how one of them influences..."):** This moves beyond simple recall. It requires a basic level of application or reasoning to connect the resource to its practical impact. For example, if they mention "water," they need to explain it's used for drinking, irrigation, etc., in a desert state. If they mention "marble," they might say it's used for construction, generates income for miners/carvers, etc.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Mentioning resources:** This is a very common type of textbook question (e.g., "List the minerals found in X state"). It's on the easier side for recall.
*   **Explaining influence:** This is moderately more difficult than simple recall. Textbook exercises often ask "How is X important?" or "What are the uses of Y?". This question is similar in structure. The challenge here is the *explanation* itself, which requires more than a single word and necessitates forming a coherent sentence or two.

**Specific Considerations for Class 6, economically weaker, Hindi-medium students:**

*   **English proficiency:** The term "natural resources" and especially "influences" could be significant barriers. They might understand the *concept* but struggle with expressing it in English.
*   **Socio-economic context:** Their direct experience might make certain resources more salient (e.g., water scarcity in Rajasthan is a lived reality for many). This could aid in recall and explanation for water-related resources. However, for mineral resources like mica or zinc, which might be less directly observable, it's purely academic recall.
*   **Textbook focus:** Indian textbooks often emphasize local geography and resources. Rajasthan is a prominent state, so its resources would likely be covered.
*   **Rubric flexibility:** The rubric allows for a wide range of correct resources, including very common ones like water and sunlight, making the "mention" part easier. The "explanation" for these common resources (e.g., water for drinking/agriculture) is also relatively simple.

**Overall Difficulty Assessment:**

The question is a mix of easy recall and moderate application/explanation. The "mention two resources" part is likely to be accessible. The "explain how one influences" part raises the difficulty due to the language demand ("influences") and the need for a short coherent explanation in English. Given the average pass rate of 29% for similar items, this question feels slightly above that average for the recall part, but the explanation pulls it closer to or slightly below average due to language and explanation demands.

Students might correctly list two resources but struggle to articulate the influence clearly in English, potentially scoring 0 if the explanation is entirely absent or incomprehensible, even if the resources are correct.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%**

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Higher than average recall:** Many students would likely be able to recall at least two natural resources from Rajasthan (e.g
