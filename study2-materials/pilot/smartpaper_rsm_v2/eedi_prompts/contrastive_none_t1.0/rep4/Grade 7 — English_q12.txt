Let's break down the question for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the specified context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammar:** Students are expected to understand the concepts of "subject," "verb," and "object." They need to know what "active voice" and "passive voice" are, and the grammatical rules for transformation (e.g., object becomes subject, 'be' verb + past participle, 'by' phrase). This is typically taught in English grammar classes by Class 7, but mastery varies greatly.
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "wind" (common, likely known)
        *   "blew" (past tense of blow, common, likely known)
        *   "leaves" (common, likely known)
        *   "away" (common, likely known)
        *   "sentence" (common, likely known)
        *   "Active Voice" (technical term, learned in grammar class)
        *   "Passive Voice" (technical term, learned in grammar class)
        *   "Change" (common, likely known)
        *   "following" (common, likely known)
    *   **Context:** The sentence itself ("The wind blew the leaves away") describes a very common, observable phenomenon. No complex world knowledge is needed.

*   **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Instructional Language:** The instructions ("Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice") are direct and use technical grammar terms. Students need to understand these terms to even attempt the question. If they haven't grasped the *meaning* of "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" in English, they are stuck.
    *   **Sentence Complexity (Original):** "The wind blew the leaves away." This is a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) sentence with an adverbial phrase. It's not overly complex to understand the meaning.
    *   **Vocabulary Load:** The vocabulary in the *sentence to be transformed* is very basic and likely known. The challenge lies in the *grammatical terminology* of the instruction.
    *   **Medium of Instruction:** For Hindi-medium students, even if they've learned these concepts in their English class, the initial understanding might have been facilitated through Hindi explanations. Translating that conceptual understanding back to the English instruction can be a hurdle. They might recognize "Voice" but struggle with "Active" and "Passive" if not rigorously reinforced in English.

*   **Type of Task:**
    *   **Application:** This is a clear application task. Students aren't recalling a definition but applying a specific set of grammatical rules to transform a given sentence.
    *   **Reasoning:** Minimal reasoning beyond applying rules. They need to identify the subject, verb, and object, and then reconfigure them according to passive voice rules.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very standard, foundational exercise for active/passive voice transformation. It's often one of the first examples given when teaching the concept.
    *   The sentence structure is simple, not involving complex tenses (e.g., perfect continuous), modals, or multiple clauses.
    *   It's generally considered an "easy" to "medium" difficulty item *within the topic of active/passive voice* once the concept is understood.
    *   The primary difficulty for these students will not be the sentence itself, but the *command of the grammatical concept and terminology in English*.

**Factors that make it HARD for this group:**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency (LEP) & Grammatical Terminology:** The biggest hurdle is understanding "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" *in English*. If they don't know what these terms refer to, they cannot even begin.
2.  **Rote Learning vs. Conceptual Understanding:** Many students might have rote-learned rules for transforming specific sentence types without a deep conceptual understanding of why/how. This simple sentence might still trip them if their rote learning is weak or not flexible.
3.  **Past Participle Recall:** "blown" is the past participle of "blow." While common, some students might struggle to recall the correct form, especially for irregular verbs.
4.  **Structure of the Passive Voice:** Remembering to use the correct 'be' verb (was/were) and the 'by' phrase is crucial.
5.  **Average Pass Rate:** The overall average pass rate of 29% across *all items* indicates that even "easy" items might have a lower success rate due to systemic challenges.

**Factors that make it EASIER for this group:**

1.  **Simple Sentence Structure:** No complex tenses,
