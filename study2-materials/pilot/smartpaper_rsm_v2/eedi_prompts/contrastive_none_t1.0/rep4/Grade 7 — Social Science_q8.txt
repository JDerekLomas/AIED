Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students are expected to have a basic understanding of what "rural areas" are and what "occupations" mean. They should also have some general knowledge about Rajasthan, even if not specifically detailed economic geography. Most Class 7 social science curricula cover basic geography, states, and economic activities. The idea of people working to earn a living is fundamental.
    *   **Potential Gaps:** While general concepts are likely taught, specific details about *Rajasthan's* rural economy might vary in depth across different textbooks or teaching styles. However, agriculture and animal husbandry are so dominant in Indian rural areas generally that they should be well-known.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Occupations":** This is a key term. While relatively common, students might be more familiar with terms like "work" or "dhandha" (Hindi for business/profession). However, "occupations" is a standard Social Science term and likely introduced.
    *   **"Rural areas":** This is also a standard term and should be understood.
    *   **"Rajasthan":** A proper noun, known to students.
    *   **"Describe any one in brief":** This part requires comprehension of an instruction to elaborate concisely.
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary is straightforward for Social Science, not overly complex or abstract. It's likely within the range of terms they've encountered, perhaps with teacher explanation in Hindi. The instruction to "describe" is also common.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **Mainly Recall:** Identifying the main occupations is primarily recall of facts related to rural economies, particularly in a state like Rajasthan.
    *   **Minor Application/Description:** "Describe any one in brief" requires a very basic level of application – taking a recalled fact (e.g., agriculture) and providing a sentence or two about what it entails. This is not complex reasoning, more like simple elaboration.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Standard:** This question aligns very well with typical short-answer or fill-in-the-blank questions found in Class 7 Social Science textbooks. Questions about the economic activities of different regions or types of settlements (rural vs. urban) are very common.
    *   **Not overly detailed:** It asks for "main" occupations and "brief" description, which keeps the answer scope manageable. It doesn't require deep analysis or statistical data, just general knowledge.

**Specific Easiness/Hardness Points:**

*   **Easiness:**
    *   **Ubiquity of Agriculture/Animal Husbandry:** These are the bedrock of most Indian rural economies. Even if students haven't specifically memorized "Rajasthan," their general knowledge of rural India would strongly point to these two.
    *   **Simple Language:** The terms are common in Social Science.
    *   **Recall-based:** Doesn't demand high-level analytical skills.
    *   **Clear Rubric:** Naming two is enough, making it achievable.
*   **Hardness:**
    *   **Specific to Rajasthan:** While general knowledge helps, if a student has *zero* exposure to Rajasthan's geography/economy, they might struggle to be specific beyond generic "farmer." However, Rajasthan's desert and semi-arid climate make animal husbandry particularly prominent, which is often highlighted.
    *   **"Describe in brief":** Some students might struggle to articulate even a simple description in English, even if they know the occupation. This could lead to a correct list but failure to elaborate. However, the rubric only requires naming, so the description part is extra credit essentially for a "max score" (which is 1 here, meaning naming two is enough).

**Conclusion:**

This question is fairly straightforward for a Class 7 Social Science student. The core knowledge (agriculture, animal husbandry) is fundamental to understanding rural India. The language demands are manageable. The "describe" part might be a minor hurdle for some in terms of English expression, but the primary requirement for scoring (naming two occupations) is recall-based and accessible. Given the average pass rate of 29%, this question seems like it would be on the *easier* side of that average. Students might struggle if they have very weak English *and* very poor recall of even general Indian geography, but the topic is so central that many should manage.

A significant proportion of students should be able to identify "agriculture" and "animal husbandry/farming." The "handicrafts" option might be less universally known but still plausible.
