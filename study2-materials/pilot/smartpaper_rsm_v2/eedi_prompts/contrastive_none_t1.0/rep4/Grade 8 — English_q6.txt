Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 Indian government school students.

### Contrastive Analysis of "Define fable"

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Positive:** The concept of "story" (kahani) and "moral" (sikh) is very common in Indian culture and education from a young age. Many students would have been exposed to fables in their local language (e.g., Panchatantra stories, Jataka tales) through storytelling, textbooks, or even family. They understand the idea of animals talking and teaching a lesson.
*   **Challenge:** While the concept might be familiar, the *specific English term* "fable" might not be. They might know the stories but not the formal English classification. They might know "moral story" or "animal story" in Hindi.

**2. Language Demands:**

*   **Difficulty - "Define":** This is a key challenge. While "define" is a common instruction, for students with limited English, it might be more challenging than "What is a fable?" or "Tell me about a fable." "Define" requires a precise, formal explanation rather than just describing it.
*   **Difficulty - "fable":** This is a relatively low-frequency word in everyday English, even for native speakers. For someone with limited English exposure, it might be completely unknown.
*   **Expected Output:** The rubric expects specific vocabulary like "typically uses animals as characters" and "imparts a moral lesson." While the *concept* of animals and morals is known, expressing it in this formal English might be difficult. They might use simpler phrases like "animal story" or "story with a lesson."
*   **Hindi Equivalent:** "नीतिकथा" (neetikatha - moral story) or "पशु-कथा" (pashu-katha - animal story) could be their internal translations, but articulating the definition in English would still be hard.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Recall:** This is primarily a recall question. Students need to recall the definition of the specific term "fable."
*   **Implicit Application/Reasoning (if unfamiliar):** If they don't know the word "fable," there's no way to apply or reason their way to the definition, even if they know stories *that are fables*. They can't infer the definition from context as there is no context given.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Textbook Context:** Class 8 English textbooks *might* introduce terms like "fable," "myth," "legend" in a literature context, but often these are briefly mentioned or assumed knowledge rather than deeply defined and practiced. If a textbook chapter specifically on literary genres had "fable" as a key vocabulary word and provided a definition, then it would be easier.
*   **Typical Exercise:** Many exercises focus on reading comprehension, grammar, or answering specific questions about a text. A direct definition recall of a relatively uncommon literary term might be less frequent than, say, defining "noun" or "verb."
*   **Rubric Demands:** The rubric's specific phrasing ("typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson") suggests a level of detail that might not be explicitly memorized by many. Students might offer a partial definition (e.g., "a story with a lesson") but miss the animal character aspect, or vice-versa.

### Overall Assessment:

The primary hurdle is the *vocabulary itself* ("fable") and the *command of English* required to produce a precise definition. Even if students understand the *concept* of such stories, translating that conceptual understanding into the correct English definition, using the specific term, is challenging. The instruction "Define" adds to this by requiring a formal output.

Given the average pass rate of 29% across items, and considering the specific challenges of vocabulary and formal definition for this demographic, this question is likely to be on the harder side for them. Many might know the stories but not the word, or might only provide a partial definition.

### ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 15%

**Reasoning for 15%:**

*   **Very few would know the exact definition in English:** The term "fable" is not universal knowledge even in English-medium schools at this level, and much less so for those with limited English exposure.
*   **Partial definitions might not meet the rubric:** Many might write "a story with a moral" or "an animal story," which are partial but don't fully match the rubric's expectation of both elements combined.
*   **Reliance on specific textbook exposure:** Only those who happened to have a textbook that explicitly taught and required the recall of "fable" with both key elements (animals + moral
