Let's break down the difficulty of this question for Class 7 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Concept:** The fundamental understanding that authors/poets *have* a "writing style" that can be characterized. This is a literary concept, not a factual recall from a science or history lesson. Students might be taught this in Hindi literature classes, but the transfer to English terminology is key.
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Describes": A common verb, likely familiar.
        *   "Poet's": Possessive, also common.
        *   "Writing style": This is the most crucial phrase. "Style" itself can be tricky. Do they understand it in the context of *how* something is written, not just its appearance?
    *   **Task:** The implicit task is to *generate* a suitable word, not choose from a multiple-choice list. This requires a much deeper understanding and vocabulary.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Abstract Noun "Style":** "Style" as a literary characteristic is an abstract concept. Students are often stronger with concrete nouns and simple sentence structures.
    *   **Gerund "Writing":** While common, "writing style" as a fixed phrase might be unfamiliar.
    *   **Generating Vocabulary:** The rubric itself gives examples like "simple, descriptive, informal, direct." These words, while not exceedingly difficult individually, might not be immediately accessible for students to *produce* in this context, especially if their exposure to English literary analysis is minimal.
        *   "Descriptive" is a longer, more complex word.
        *   "Informal" might be understood in other contexts but linking it to "writing style" is a leap.
        *   "Direct" is simpler.
        *   "Simple" is arguably the easiest to recall.
    *   **Lack of Context:** The question *itself* provides no text to analyze. Students are asked what *describes* a poet's writing style, not to describe *a specific poet's* style based on provided text. This absence of context makes the question meta-cognitive and more abstract. If they were given a short poem and asked, "How would you describe *this* poet's writing style?", it would be significantly easier because the text would provide clues and a concrete basis for their answer. As it stands, it's asking for a general understanding of what *constitutes* a style descriptor.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Reasoning/Application (in absence of text):** This question, without any accompanying text, primarily tests **reasoning and conceptual understanding** of literary terms. It's asking, "What *kind* of words would you use to describe a writing style?" rather than "Apply a style descriptor to this text."
    *   **Recall (of vocabulary):** It also tests the recall of suitable adjectives to describe writing.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises often focus on:
        *   Reading comprehension (answering factual questions about a given text).
        *   Grammar (fill-in-the-blanks, sentence transformation).
        *   Basic vocabulary (matching, synonyms/antonyms).
        *   Writing simple paragraphs or letters.
    *   **This question is much more advanced.** It requires:
        *   An understanding of literary analysis concepts.
        *   The ability to generate appropriate descriptive adjectives.
        *   Abstract thinking without a concrete example to work from.
    *   If a Class 7 textbook had a chapter on "Appreciating Poetry" or "Literary Devices," it *might* introduce "style," but it's unlikely to test it in such an open-ended, decontextualized manner. More likely, it would be multiple-choice: "The poet's style is most like (a) simple (b) complex (c) musical (d) all of the above."

**Factors making it harder:**

*   **Abstract nature:** No specific poem to analyze.
*   **Generating vocabulary:** Requires students to recall suitable adjectives, not just recognize them.
*   **Literary concept:** "Writing style" might not be deeply covered or explicitly linked to English vocabulary in their curriculum.
*   **English proficiency:** The leap from everyday English to literary analysis vocabulary is significant.
*   **Open-ended:** "Identifies a suitable and relevant word" means there isn't one "right" answer, but it demands understanding the *category* of suitable answers.

**Factors making it easier (relatively):**

*   "Simple
