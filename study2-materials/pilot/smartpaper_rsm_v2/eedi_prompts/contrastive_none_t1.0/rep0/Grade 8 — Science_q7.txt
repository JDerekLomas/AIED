Let's break down the question and estimate the proportion of Class 8 Indian government school students who would get full marks (or at least the 0.5 points for noticing a change).

**Contrastive Analysis of the Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Concept:** Decomposition of organic matter (plants, vegetables, fruits).
    *   **Related Concepts:** The role of microorganisms (though not explicitly asked for, it underpins the reason), nutrient cycling, soil fertility.
    *   **Everyday Experience:** Many students, especially from rural or semi-rural backgrounds, would have seen organic waste decompose, either in a compost pit, a rubbish heap, or simply in fields. This hands-on, observational knowledge is a significant advantage.
    *   **Formal Science:** Basic concepts of decomposition and the importance of humus are covered in Class 6-8 science textbooks in India (e.g., in chapters on waste management, soil, or microorganisms).

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   "gardener," "collected," "waste of plants, vegetables and fruits," "pit," "notice any change," "after some days," "Give reasons," "evaluate," "beneficial for soil health."
    *   **Vocabulary:** All these words are relatively common and likely to be encountered in daily life or basic science lessons. "Evaluate" might be slightly more formal, but the context "is this beneficial" makes its meaning clear.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple, direct questions. No complex clauses or abstract concepts.
    *   **Overall:** The language is quite accessible. A student with limited English but decent contextual understanding should be able to grasp the core meaning. If the exam were bilingual (Hindi/English), this would be even easier. Assuming an English-only exam, the vocabulary is still manageable for a Class 8 student.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **"Does gardener notice any change after some days?" (and "Give reasons"):** Primarily **recall and application**. Students recall the concept of decomposition and apply it to a practical scenario. The reasons involve recalling *what* happens (it rots, smells, shrinks, turns into manure) and *why* (microorganisms).
    *   **"evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health":** This is more **application and reasoning**. Students need to apply their knowledge of decomposition and soil science to determine the positive impact (humus formation, nutrient return).

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Similar Scenario:** This question is very typical of the kind of practical, observation-based questions found in Indian science textbooks, especially in chapters on "Waste Management," "Microorganisms: Friend and Foe," or "Soil."
    *   **Open-ended but structured:** It asks for observation, reason, and evaluation, which is a common structure for analytical questions.
    *   **Not overly complex:** It doesn't require deep chemical knowledge or intricate biological processes beyond the basic concept of decay.
    *   **Relatability:** The scenario (gardener, waste pit) is very relatable and practical, making it less abstract than some other science concepts.

**Focusing on the Rubric for 0.5 marks: "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes."**

This is the easiest part of the question to score. Simply stating "yes, there will be a change" or "the waste will decompose/rot" is enough.

**Why it's relatively easy to get the 0.5 points:**

1.  **Observational Knowledge:** Many students would have seen organic waste decompose in real life.
2.  **Basic Curriculum:** Decomposition is a fundamental concept taught early in middle school science.
3.  **Simple Language:** The question for this part ("Does gardener notice any change?") is very direct.

**Potential Pitfalls (for the full score, but less so for the 0.5 points):**

*   **Lack of Specificity in Reasons:** While "it decomposes" might get the 0.5, a full score would require mention of microorganisms, humus, nutrient return etc.
*   **Vocabulary for "Beneficial":** Some students might struggle to articulate *why* it's beneficial beyond a vague "it's good for plants."

**Estimating for the 0.5 points (noticing a change):**

Given the average pass rate of 29% across *items*, and considering the factors above:

*   The question is highly relatable and grounded in common observation.
*   The core concept (decomposition) is fundamental and taught in Class 6-8.
*   The language demands for this specific part are minimal.
*   Scoring 0.5 only requires
