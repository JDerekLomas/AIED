Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Textual Comprehension:** The most significant assumption is that students have just read a story (presumably in English) where this detail was explicitly mentioned. Without the preceding text, this question is impossible to answer.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Lived," "inside," "book" are fairly common words, likely encountered even with limited English.
    *   **Basic Question Words:** "Who" is a fundamental question word, usually learned early.
    *   **Cultural Context:** The concept of a "fairy" is generally understood in India through local folklore and media, even if the English word is new. The "magical" aspect reinforces this.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Simplicity of Sentence Structure:** The sentence "Who lived inside the book?" is very simple: subject-verb-prepositional phrase. This is a low language demand.
    *   **Core Vocabulary:** As mentioned, the words are quite basic.
    *   **Direct Recall:** This is not a complex inference or reasoning question. It's a direct recall of a fact stated in the text. This is significantly easier than questions requiring synthesis, analysis, or application of knowledge.
    *   **Keyword Matching:** Students might be able to scan the text for "book" and "lived" (or a synonym like "was in") and then identify the associated character.
    *   **Answer Format:** A short, factual answer is expected, not a lengthy explanation. This reduces the burden of constructing complex English sentences.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** This is purely a recall question. The information should be directly stated in the story the students have just read. No application of concepts or complex reasoning is required. This makes it inherently easier than higher-order thinking questions.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easier:** Typical Class 6 English textbook exercises often include questions that require more elaborate answers, inferencing, understanding nuances, or even writing short paragraphs. This question is a very basic, "find the answer in the text" type, which is usually among the simplest questions asked after a reading passage.
    *   **Similar to Basic Comprehension:** It's comparable to the most fundamental comprehension questions (e.g., "What is the boy's name?", "Where did they go?").

**Factors that might make it difficult (despite being easy):**

*   **The preceding text:** If the text itself was very difficult, poorly written, too long, or used complex vocabulary, then even a simple recall question would be hard because students wouldn't have understood the source material.
*   **Attention Span/Reading Fatigue:** If it's towards the end of a long comprehension passage or an exam, students might have less focus.
*   **Novelty of "Magical Fairy":** While "fairy" is culturally familiar, the specific combination "magical fairy" might be new in an English context. However, given the context of a story, this is usually introduced clearly.
*   **The 29% average pass rate:** This context is crucial. A 29% average indicates significant struggles across the board. However, "average pass rate across items" includes all types of items (reading, writing, grammar, higher-order questions). A direct recall question after a *presumably simpler* text would likely perform better than the average.

**Conclusion:**

Assuming the preceding story itself was at an appropriate Class 6 level (or slightly simplified, as is often the case for assessment passages for this demographic) and that the "magical fairy" was clearly introduced, this question is at the very *easy* end of the spectrum for a comprehension task. Its simplicity in language, structure, and cognitive demand (pure recall) makes it much more accessible than many other types of questions. The biggest barrier would be not understanding the preceding story at all.

Given the 29% average pass rate for *all items*, this specific item, being a straightforward recall, should perform significantly above that average *if the text was understood*. If the text was so hard that almost no one understood it, then even this question would fail. However, assessments usually try to include a range of difficulties, and this would typically be considered a "lower-rung" item designed to capture basic understanding.

I'll assume the preceding text, while perhaps challenging, was not utterly incomprehensible to a significant portion of students, and that "magical fairy" was a clear, memorable detail.
