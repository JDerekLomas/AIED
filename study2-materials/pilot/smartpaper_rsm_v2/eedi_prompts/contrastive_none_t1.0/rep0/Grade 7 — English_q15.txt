Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, keeping their context in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis for "My Favourite Hobby" paragraph:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of 'Hobby':** This is a fairly common concept even for students from economically weaker sections. Most will understand a leisure activity they enjoy.
    *   **Basic sentence structure in English:** Subject-verb-object, simple tenses (present tense for routine, past tense if describing how they started, though present is more likely here).
    *   **Vocabulary for common hobbies:** Playing cricket, drawing, reading, cycling, watching TV, helping parents, etc. These are likely within their grasp.
    *   **Personal reflection:** The ability to think about their own preferences and express them. This is usually not an issue.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Key Vocabulary:**
        *   "Write a short paragraph": "Write" is basic. "Short" is understood. "Paragraph" might be a slight challenge for some who are used to writing individual sentences, but the 4-5 sentence guidance helps.
        *   "My Favourite Hobby": "Favourite" is common. "Hobby" is key.
        *   "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it": This is the most critical part for comprehension.
            *   "What it is": Straightforward.
            *   "When you do it": Requires expressing time (e.g., "in the evening," "on weekends," "after school").
            *   "Why you enjoy it": Requires expressing reasons/feelings (e.g., "It makes me happy," "I learn new things," "It relaxes me"). This is slightly more complex than just stating facts.
    *   **Sentence Complexity:** The requirement to link ideas within a paragraph is moderately demanding. They need to transition from stating the hobby, to when they do it, to why they enjoy it.
    *   **Grammar:** Use of simple present tense for routine and expressing enjoyment. Basic conjunctions (and, because) would be helpful.
    *   **Word Count/Length:** 4-5 sentences is manageable. Not too long to overwhelm, not too short to be incomplete.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Application & Reasoning:** This is primarily an application task (applying English writing skills to a personal topic) combined with some personal reasoning (explaining *why* they enjoy it). It's not factual recall.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Textbook Comparison:**
        *   **easier:** Often, textbook exercises at this level focus on filling in blanks, answering specific questions based on a text, or writing very short sentences. This is *not* easier than those.
        *   **similar:** Some textbooks might have "Write 5 sentences about..." or "Describe your..." which this question resembles.
        *   **harder:** More complex grammar exercises, long essays, or creative writing without structure would be harder.
    *   **Specific difficulty:** The challenge here is the *synthesizing* requirement – putting together different pieces of information (what, when, why) into a coherent, flowing paragraph, rather than just isolated sentences. For students with limited English, generating this flow can be tough. The prompt clearly defines the required components, which helps significantly.

**Factors making it easier:**
*   **Personal topic:** Students don't need external knowledge; it's about their own life. This reduces cognitive load.
*   **Clear structure provided:** The "what, when, why" bullet points are excellent scaffolding.
*   **Short length:** 4-5 sentences is achievable.
*   **Common concept:** 'Hobby' is relatable.

**Factors making it harder:**
*   **Paragraph structure:** Beyond single sentences.
*   **Expressing reasons/feelings:** "Why you enjoy it" demands slightly more complex vocabulary and sentence structure than just naming something or stating a time.
*   **Limited vocabulary/grammar for connectors:** Students might struggle to link sentences smoothly (e.g., "I do it in the evening. It makes me happy." rather than "I do it in the evening *because* it makes me happy.").
*   **"Correctly" according to rubric:** A simple list of sentences (e.g., "My hobby is drawing. I draw in the evening. I like drawing. I feel happy.") might technically meet the components but might not feel like a "paragraph" in a sophisticated sense. However, the rubric is quite forgiving: "Student writes a complete paragraph that
