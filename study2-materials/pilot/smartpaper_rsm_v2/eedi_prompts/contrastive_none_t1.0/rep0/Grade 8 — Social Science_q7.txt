Let's break down the question's difficulty for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, considering their specific context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have covered the Battle of Plassey (1757) in their Class 8 Social Science (History) curriculum. This is a foundational event in the rise of British power. They should know *what* it was (a battle) and *when* it happened.
    *   **Assumed (but potentially weak):** Understanding of terms like "British power," "expansion," and the concept of a "puppet nawab" or "political dominance." While these are taught, the depth of understanding might vary. They need to connect the *battle* to *political consequences*.
    *   **Not assumed (but helpful):** Detailed knowledge of the personalities involved (Clive, Siraj-ud-Daulah, Mir Jafar) beyond their roles in the outcome. The question focuses on the *contribution to expansion*, not the narrative details.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **"How did... contribute to..."**: This phrasing requires understanding causality and linking an event to its effect. For students with limited English, "contribute to" can be tricky. They might understand "how it helped" but linking it to "expansion" requires a slightly more nuanced grasp.
    *   **"expansion of British power"**: "Expansion" is a common enough word, but "British power" might be interpreted broadly (trade, territory, political). The rubric specifically looks for political dominance.
    *   **Rubric terms ("political dominance/control," "puppet nawab"):** If students use these exact terms, it shows strong comprehension. However, they might use simpler language like "British took over Bengal" or "British controlled the ruler." The key is the *idea* of political control.
    *   **Overall:** The sentence structure is straightforward, but the vocabulary, while academic for Class 8 history, could pose a barrier for those with very limited English who might struggle to precisely articulate the *impact* rather than just stating *what happened*.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Predominantly Recall:** The core answer (British political dominance over Bengal, placing Mir Jafar) is a direct recall of the most significant consequence taught in textbooks.
    *   **Some Reasoning/Application:** To get full credit, students need to *explain* the contribution, not just state a fact. This requires connecting the victory to its *implication* for British power, which moves slightly beyond pure factual recall into a basic level of historical reasoning (cause-and-effect). They need to articulate *why* it contributed, not just *that* it happened.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Medium-High:** Typical textbook exercises often ask "What was the Battle of Plassey?" or "Who won the Battle of Plassey?" or "List the causes/consequences of the Battle of Plassey." This question is slightly more demanding because it asks for a *specific type* of consequence (contribution to expansion of power) and requires an explanation.
    *   Simple recall questions (e.g., "When was the Battle of Plassey?") would be easier. Open-ended questions requiring extensive narrative (e.g., "Describe the Battle of Plassey") would be harder due to the volume of output.
    *   This question sits in the middle, requiring a focused, analytical answer based on recalled information.

**Factors Affecting Performance:**

*   **Curriculum Coverage:** This is a major topic, so almost all students would have been taught it.
*   **Quality of Teaching:** If the teacher focused purely on memorizing facts rather than understanding the *significance* of events, students might struggle to articulate the "how it contributed" aspect.
*   **Access to Study Materials:** Limited access might mean students rely heavily on in-class notes, which might be simplified.
*   **Exam Practice:** Familiarity with questions that ask for explanation and analysis rather than just factual recall.
*   **English Proficiency:** This is a critical barrier. While they might know the Hindi equivalent, translating that into coherent English that satisfies the rubric is challenging. They might know "angrezon ne Bengal par kabza kar liya" (British took control of Bengal) but struggle to phrase "established political dominance."

Considering an average pass rate of 29% across items, this question is likely *above average* in difficulty for these students due to the requirement for explanation and the specific phrasing, coupled with limited English proficiency.

A student who simply writes "British won the battle" or "British got control of Bengal" might not get full marks if the rubric is strictly applied, requiring the idea of
