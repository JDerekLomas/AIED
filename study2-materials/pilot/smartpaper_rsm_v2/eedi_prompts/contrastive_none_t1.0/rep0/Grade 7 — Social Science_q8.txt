Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, keeping in mind their background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Easy:** Students in rural India, and even those in urban areas with rural connections, are likely very familiar with common rural occupations. Agriculture and animal husbandry are core to the Indian economy and everyday life, especially in states like Rajasthan known for both farming and pastoral communities. They likely see these occupations firsthand in their villages or when visiting relatives.
    *   **Moderate:** Knowing specific *main* occupations for a *specific state* like Rajasthan might be slightly more challenging than just "rural areas" generally, but given Rajasthan's prominence in the curriculum (due to its distinct geography and culture), students should have some exposure.
    *   **Hard:** None directly. The concepts are grounded in their reality.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Easy:**
        *   "What are the main occupations" - "Main" (मुख्य) and "occupations" (पेशा/काम धंधे) are very common and foundational vocabulary.
        *   "people in the rural areas" - "People" (लोग), "rural" (ग्रामीण/देहाती), "areas" (क्षेत्र) are also extremely common.
        *   "of Rajasthan" - The name of the state is straightforward.
        *   "Describe any one in brief" - "Describe" (वर्णन करो), "any one" (किसी एक का), "in brief" (संक्षेप में) are common instructional verbs.
    *   **Overall Language Demand:** The language is quite simple and direct. There are no complex sentence structures, idioms, or highly academic vocabulary. It uses terms that would likely be covered early in English language instruction or are easily inferable. Crucially, the *content* being asked for is concrete and familiar, reducing the cognitive load that might otherwise be amplified by language barriers.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **recall**. Students need to recall factual information about common occupations in rural Rajasthan.
    *   The "describe any one in brief" part involves a very basic level of **application** or articulation of recalled knowledge, but it's not complex reasoning or problem-solving. It's essentially "list and then elaborate on one item from your list."

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Similar/Slightly Easier:** This question is very much in line with typical "fill in the blanks," "short answer," or "list the following" questions found in Social Science textbooks for this age group. It tests fundamental geographical/economic knowledge. Many textbook chapters on different regions of India would cover the primary occupations. It's a straightforward knowledge retrieval question. It doesn't require critical analysis, comparison, or synthesis of multiple concepts, which can be harder.

**Synthesis of Difficulty:**

This question is, by most metrics, **relatively easy** for Class 7 Social Science content, even with the constraints of limited English proficiency and economically weaker backgrounds.

*   The content (rural occupations) is highly relevant to their lives and surroundings.
*   The language used is simple, direct, and consists of high-frequency vocabulary.
*   It primarily tests recall, which is a common and accessible cognitive demand in these exams.
*   It aligns well with basic textbook knowledge for a specific state that is likely covered in detail.

The instruction to "describe any one in brief" adds a small layer but is unlikely to trip up students who know the occupations. Even if they just list two correctly without description, they still meet the rubric for a score of 1.

Given the average pass rate is 29%, this question is clearly *above* average in its accessibility. The main challenge might be rote memorization of specific facts about Rajasthan, but common sense and observation should get most of the way there.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 65%**
