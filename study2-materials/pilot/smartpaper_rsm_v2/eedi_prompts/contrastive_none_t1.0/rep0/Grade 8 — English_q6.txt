Here's a contrastive analysis of the question "Define fable" for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, followed by an estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis: "Define fable."**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct Knowledge:** Students are assumed to know the *concept* of a fable. This isn't a highly technical term like "photosynthesis" in science, but it's a specific literary term. They may have encountered fables (like Aesop's fables) in their vernacular language or even in English as stories, without necessarily knowing the *definition* of the genre itself. They might recognize the stories but not the umbrella term.
    *   **Indirect Knowledge:** Understanding the components of the definition (short story, animals as characters, moral lesson) requires basic comprehension of these individual terms. "Moral lesson" is key, and understanding what a "moral" is (a lesson about right/wrong conduct) is crucial.

2.  **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Define": This is a common directive verb in exams, so many students would understand it means "explain what it is."
        *   "Fable": This is the core vocabulary item. It's not an everyday word, and its meaning isn't easily inferable from context if they haven't learned it. It's a specific literary term.
        *   Words in the rubric definition ("short story," "typically," "uses animals as characters," "imparts," "moral lesson"): These are generally accessible words, though "imparts" might be slightly less common than "gives" or "teaches." "Moral lesson" itself is two words but acts as a single concept.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** The prompt "Define fable" is simple. Formulating the definition requires constructing a coherent sentence or two. The rubric's definition is grammatically straightforward.
    *   **Idioms/Figurative Language:** None.
    *   **Overall:** The language is quite direct. The biggest hurdle is the word "fable" itself and the ability to articulate its features in English. If they know the *concept* in Hindi (e.g., "नीति कथा" - neeti katha), translating that precise definition into English, particularly the "moral lesson" part, might be challenging.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** This is almost purely a recall question. Students either know the definition of "fable" or they don't. There's very little room for application or reasoning beyond recalling learned information. They aren't asked to identify a fable from a list, or write their own, but simply to define it.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Textbook Presence:** Fables are often introduced in Class 6-8 English textbooks as reading comprehension passages. The *term* "fable" and its *definition* are usually explicitly taught alongside these stories, often in a "vocabulary" or "literary terms" section.
    *   **Difficulty:**
        *   It's **less difficult** than questions requiring complex inferencing from unseen text or multi-step problem-solving.
        *   It's **more difficult** than simple factual recall of concrete details from a directly studied text (e.g., "Who was the main character of the story?").
        *   It's **comparable** to defining other literary terms like "poem," "story," or "play" if those have been explicitly taught.
        *   The challenge for these students lies in the specificity of the term and the need to recall a *precise* definition in English, not just a general idea. Many might get "short story with animals" but miss the critical "moral lesson" aspect.

**Synthesis for Indian Government School Class 8 Students:**

*   Many students will have encountered fables as stories (in Hindi or English), so the *concept* isn't alien.
*   The crucial factor is whether the *specific term* "fable" and its standard English definition have been explicitly taught and reinforced in their English classes. Given the focus on textbook content, it's highly probable it would appear in a glossary or as part of a literature lesson.
*   Limited English proficiency means that while they might *understand* the core components (animals, story, lesson), articulating all three accurately and concisely in English, especially "imparts a moral lesson," could be a struggle. They might give a partial definition.
*   The "moral lesson" part is often the distinguishing feature of a fable, and missing it would likely lead to a zero score based on the rubric.
