Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geography of Rajasthan:** Students need to know that Rajasthan is a state in India and have some basic understanding of its geographical features and resources. This is standard Class 6 Social Science content.
    *   **Definition of "Natural Resources":** They should understand what natural resources are (things from nature used by humans). This is foundational and usually covered.
    *   **Influence/Impact:** They need to grasp the concept of how a resource affects human life.

2.  **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **"Mention any two natural resources":** "Mention" is a fairly common verb. "Natural resources" is a key term in Social Science and would likely be taught and reinforced.
    *   **"found in Rajasthan":** Straightforward.
    *   **"explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** This is the more challenging part.
        *   "Explain how": Requires more than just listing; it demands a descriptive sentence or two.
        *   "influences": This word might be slightly challenging for some. They might understand "affects" or "changes" better.
        *   "lives of the people": Clear.
        *   "there": Refers to Rajasthan.

    *   **Overall:** The sentence structure for the explanation is more complex than a simple recall question. Students might be able to list resources but struggle to articulate the "how it influences" part in English. They might know the Hindi equivalent and struggle with the English phrasing.

3.  **Type of Cognitive Demand:**
    *   **"Mention any two natural resources":** This is primarily **recall**. Students need to remember resources specific to Rajasthan.
    *   **"explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** This is **application/reasoning**. It requires them to connect the resource to its human impact, which is a step beyond mere recall. It's not a complex reasoning task, but it requires a basic causal link.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Recall questions:** "List two resources found in Rajasthan" are very common.
    *   **Explanation questions:** "How does X affect Y?" are also common but often require more elaborate answers than simple lists.
    *   **Difficulty:** This question is *moderately more difficult* than a simple recall question but *less difficult* than a complex analytical or problem-solving task. The "explain how it influences" part elevates it beyond a basic factual recall, demanding a small amount of descriptive writing and understanding of cause-and-effect. Typical textbook questions might ask to "describe the importance of water resources in Rajasthan," which is very similar in demand.

**Specific Points of Difficulty/Ease:**

*   **Ease:**
    *   Rajasthan's resources are quite distinct (e.g., desert, marble, copper, salt, solar potential). These are prominent in discussions about the state.
    *   "Water" is an obvious and easy resource to mention, and its influence on a desert state is also very straightforward to explain (agriculture, drinking, scarcity).
    *   The rubric accepts common, distinct resources.
*   **Difficulty:**
    *   The "explain how one of them influences" part is the main hurdle, especially the English phrasing for students with limited proficiency. They might know the concept but struggle to articulate it concisely in English.
    *   The "Max score: 1" for mentioning *two* resources *and* explaining one means partial credit isn't built into the scoring for just listing resources. A student who lists two resources but fails the explanation gets 0.

**Synthesis for Estimate:**

Given the average pass rate of 29% across items:

*   Many students will know *some* resources.
*   A good number will know *two* specific resources for Rajasthan.
*   The "explanation" part in English is the biggest differentiator. Students might struggle to form a coherent English sentence explaining the influence, even if they understand it.
*   The fact that the whole thing is worth only 1 mark means no partial credit for just listing resources, making it harder to get that '1'.

I anticipate that a significant portion of students will be able to list two resources, but fewer will be able to articulate the influence clearly in English. However, for a very prominent resource like 'water' in Rajasthan, the influence (scarcity, importance for agriculture/drinking) is quite obvious and simple to phrase.

Therefore, compared to the 29% average:
*   **Recall of resources:** Likely above
