Let's break down the difficulty of this question for Class 7 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections, with limited English proficiency.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammatical Concepts:** A fundamental understanding of "sentence," "subject," "verb," "object" is required. More critically, they need to know what "active voice" and "passive voice" are, and the rules for transformation. This is a specific grammatical concept, not a general vocabulary or comprehension skill.
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Change," "following," "sentence," "Active Voice," "Passive Voice": These are all meta-language terms related to grammar instruction. If they haven't explicitly been taught grammar *in English* using these terms, they will be lost.
        *   "wind," "blew" (past tense of blow), "leaves," "away": These are relatively common words. "Leaves" might be known, "wind" is very common. "Blew" as the past tense of "blow" might be a slight challenge if irregular verbs are not well-practiced. "Away" is also common.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** They need to be able to identify the subject ("wind"), verb ("blew"), and object ("leaves") in the original sentence.

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Instructional Language:** The instructions themselves are entirely in English and use specific grammatical terminology ("Active Voice," "Passive Voice"). This is a huge hurdle. If they have learned these concepts in Hindi (e.g., "कर्तृवाच्य" and "कर्मवाच्य"), but not the English equivalents, they won't even understand what is being asked.
    *   **Vocabulary in Question:** While "wind," "leaves," "blew," "away" are relatively common, the overall grammatical context elevates the difficulty significantly.
    *   **Tense and Verb Forms:** The transformation requires knowledge of past tense verbs and the formation of the past participle ("blown"). This is often a weak point for students learning English.
    *   **Prepositional Phrase:** The "by the wind" part requires them to correctly insert the agent.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of a learned grammatical rule. It's not simple recall of a definition, nor is it complex reasoning. It requires them to apply a specific set of steps (identify SVO, swap S and O, change verb to 'be' + past participle, add 'by' + original subject).

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Difficulty Level:** This is a *standard* grammar exercise for Class 7 in English-medium schools, or for students with a decent foundation in English grammar.
    *   **Context for these students:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, this would likely be considered a *difficult* exercise unless their specific English curriculum has extensively covered active/passive voice transformation with explicit instruction in English. Many government school curricula might prioritize basic comprehension and vocabulary over advanced grammatical transformations in English. If they *have* covered it, it might have been rote memorization rather than deep understanding.
    *   **Format:** The "Change the following sentence..." format is typical.

**Challenges Specific to This Group:**

*   **Understanding the Question:** The biggest barrier is likely understanding "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" in English. If these terms haven't been taught explicitly in English, or if they lack the equivalent conceptual understanding even in Hindi, they cannot begin.
*   **Verb Conjugation (Irregular Verbs):** "Blew" (past tense) to "blown" (past participle) for "blow" is an irregular verb. This is often tricky.
*   **Sentence Structure Manipulation:** Swapping subject and object, adding "be" verb (was/were), and including "by the agent" requires a good grasp of English sentence structure, which might be underdeveloped.
*   **Limited Exposure:** If their exposure to English is primarily functional (basic sentences, greetings), this type of prescriptive grammar task will be very challenging.

**Factors that might make it easier (but still limited):**

*   If their teacher has very recently and very thoroughly taught Active/Passive Voice *in English*, with many examples.
*   If they have access to bilingual dictionaries or if the teacher translates key terms. (Unlikely in a standardized exam setting).
*   The original sentence is simple and uses common words.

Given the average pass rate across items is 29%, and this item requires specific grammatical knowledge *in English* which is often a later or more advanced topic for non-native speakers, it's likely to be on the lower end
