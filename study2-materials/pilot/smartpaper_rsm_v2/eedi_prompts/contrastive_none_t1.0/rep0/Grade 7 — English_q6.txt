Let's break down the question and rubric for Class 7 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Concept:** Understanding of "writing style" and what it entails (word choice, sentence structure, tone, imagery, etc.). This is a foundational literary concept.
    *   **Poetry-Specific:** While the question is general, the context of *describing the poet's writing style* implies they've read a poem and are expected to analyze its literary features. They would need to have read a poem recently to answer this meaningfully.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Familiarity with descriptive adjectives like "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct" and similar terms that can characterize writing.
    *   **Application:** The ability to *apply* these descriptors to a text they've read.

*   **Language Demands (English Proficiency Focus):**
    *   **"Describes":** This is a common and relatively high-frequency verb, likely understood.
    *   **"Poet's":** Again, a common noun and possessive.
    *   **"Writing style":** This is the most crucial term. "Writing" is straightforward. "Style" in this context might be challenging. While they might understand "style" in terms of clothing or hair, "writing style" as a literary concept could be unfamiliar or only vaguely understood, especially if their English literary instruction is limited or primarily rote. They might not have the specific metalanguage in English to discuss literary style effectively.
    *   **Rubric Words:** "suitable," "relevant," "identifies," "appropriate." These are moderately challenging vocabulary. The examples given ("simple, descriptive, informal, direct") are generally within the grasp of a Class 7 student, although "informal" might be less common in their everyday vocabulary.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** This is primarily an application and reasoning task. It's not recall of a fact. Students need to have read a poem, processed its characteristics, and then *applied* an appropriate descriptive word from their vocabulary to characterize it. It requires analytical thinking, even if basic.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Standard Textbook (English):** In a well-resourced English medium school, Class 7 students would likely have exercises asking them to "describe the character," "summarize the plot," or even "comment on the author's message." Describing "writing style" would be a common, albeit slightly more advanced, analytical task.
    *   **Typical Hindi-Medium Government School:** Exercises might be more focused on direct comprehension ("Who is the main character?", "What happened next?") or vocabulary building. Analytical questions requiring interpretation of literary techniques or authorial choices are often less emphasized, especially in English, due to language barriers. They might do this in Hindi literature, but translating that analytical thought into appropriate English vocabulary for "writing style" would be tough. The focus is often on rote memorization for exams.

**Overall Assessment:**

The core challenge for these students will be:
1.  **Understanding "writing style" as a literary concept in English:** This is the most significant hurdle. If they don't grasp this, they won't know what to look for or how to respond.
2.  **Accessing appropriate English vocabulary:** Even if they understand the concept in Hindi, finding the correct English words to describe a style (like "simple," "descriptive," etc.) might be difficult. Their English vocabulary might be sufficient for basic nouns/verbs but not for nuanced literary descriptors.
3.  **Analytical Demand:** Applying an adjective to describe a literary feature is a step beyond simple comprehension.

Given the average pass rate of 29% for all items, and considering the specific challenges of "writing style" as a literary concept in English for students with limited English proficiency from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium schools, this question is likely on the harder side of average. They might understand the *gist* of the poem, but articulating its *style* in English is a higher-order skill.

Many might leave it blank, or offer a very generic, non-specific answer that doesn't meet the rubric's demand for a word *describing the writing style*. Some might try to describe the *content* of the poem instead of the *style*.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **15%**
