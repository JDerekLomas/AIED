Let's break down the question "Describes the poet's writing style" for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low Difficulty:** Students are likely familiar with the concept of a "poet" and "writing" from their literature classes, even if in Hindi. They've been exposed to different stories and poems.
    *   **Moderate Difficulty:** The term "style" is the trickier part. While they might intuitively grasp that different authors write differently, articulating "writing style" explicitly in English as a literary concept might be new or underdeveloped. They might think of "good writing" versus "bad writing" rather than "descriptive style" versus "narrative style."
    *   **Crucial Missing Information:** The question is decontextualized. It *doesn't* provide a poem or even a poet's name. This means students are expected to describe a hypothetical "poet's writing style" or perhaps recall *general* characteristics of poetry they've read. This lack of specific text makes it much harder to answer meaningfully and correctly. Without a text, any answer is pure speculation or based on generic knowledge, which is difficult to do accurately to meet the rubric.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Describes":** This is a fairly common verb. Many students would understand it means "to tell about" or "to say what it is like."
    *   **"Poet's":** "Poet" is a recognizable word. The possessive 's might be a minor hurdle for some, but generally understandable in context.
    *   **"Writing":** Very common and understood.
    *   **"Style":** This is the most demanding English word here. It's an abstract noun. While "fashion style" might be known, "writing style" in a literary context is a more specific and advanced usage. Students might struggle to retrieve an appropriate English vocabulary word to describe a style, even if they understand the concept. Words like "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct" (as per the rubric) are not necessarily high-frequency vocabulary for this demographic, especially in a literary context. They might know "easy" or "hard" but not "simple" or "complex."

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This question, in its current decontextualized form, is primarily **recall** of vocabulary (words to describe style) and perhaps **reasoning** if they try to generalize about "typical" poetry.
    *   However, if a poem *were* provided, it would become an **application** task, requiring them to analyze the text and then apply descriptive vocabulary. Without the text, it's very difficult to apply anything.
    *   The rubric's expectation for "suitable and relevant" words points towards analysis and application, which is impossible without a text. This makes the question fundamentally flawed in its current presentation.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises often focus on comprehension (answering direct questions about a provided text), vocabulary building (matching, fill-in-the-blanks), and basic grammar.
    *   Questions about "writing style" are usually introduced *after* a specific poem or story has been read and discussed. They would often be phrased as: "What can you say about *[Poet X]'s* writing style in *[Poem Y]*?" or "Describe how the poet uses *[literary device]* to create an effect."
    *   Asking to describe "the poet's writing style" in a vacuum is significantly more challenging than typical exercises because it lacks context and demands higher-order thinking (generalization, abstract description) without the foundational text. The expectation of using specific descriptive adjectives (simple, descriptive, informal, direct) without a reference point is also difficult. Students might fall back on generic "good" or "beautiful" which might not meet the rubric.

**Conclusion on Difficulty:**

This question is **very difficult** for the target demographic due to:
1.  **Decontextualization:** No poem or poet is provided, making it impossible to answer meaningfully based on analysis.
2.  **Abstract Noun "Style":** The concept of "writing style" itself, especially in English, is relatively advanced.
3.  **Vocabulary Demands:** Recalling appropriate English adjectives to describe a *hypothetical* writing style is challenging for students with limited English proficiency.
4.  **Flawed Task Design:** It asks for application/analysis without providing the content to apply/analyze.
