Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** The student needs to have read and understood the *given* poem (which is not provided here, but is a prerequisite for answering this question). This is the biggest unknown variable. If the poem itself is complex or uses difficult vocabulary, the student's ability to answer this question will be severely hampered.
    *   **Basic Literary Appreciation:** The concept of "liking" a line from a poem and articulating *why* is an emergent skill at this level. They might be used to factual recall questions ("Who is the poem about?"), but expressing personal preference and justifying it is a step up.
    *   **Vocabulary/Concepts:** "Line," "poem," "like," "most," "why." These are fairly common words, but "why" requires more than just identification.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Identifying "Line":** This might be straightforward if they understand "line" as a row of words.
    *   **"Like the most":** This comparative phrasing is generally understood.
    *   **"Why":** This is the key challenge. It requires producing a *reason* in English. This moves beyond simple word recognition or short-answer recall. Students might struggle to articulate their reasons beyond very simple phrases like "it is good" or "I like it." Constructing a grammatically correct sentence or two to explain their preference is a significant hurdle.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Answering "why" typically requires a sentence structure like "I like [line] because [reason]." This is a relatively complex sentence for a student with limited English proficiency. They might revert to a simpler structure or just give a one-word answer for "why."
    *   **Vocabulary for Reasons:** What vocabulary would they use to explain *why* they like a line? "It's nice," "it's beautiful," "it makes me happy," "it's easy to understand." Their available vocabulary for expressing abstract reasons will be limited.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **reasoning and application**, with an element of **personal expression**.
    *   It's not recall, as the answer isn't directly stated in the poem.
    *   It requires applying their understanding of the poem and their personal preferences, and then reasoning *why* that preference exists. This is a higher-order thinking skill than simple comprehension.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **More Difficult:** Typical Class 6 English exercises often focus on:
        *   Reading comprehension (factual questions: "Who did what?", "When did it happen?").
        *   Vocabulary (matching, fill-in-the-blanks).
        *   Grammar (identifying parts of speech, simple sentence formation).
        *   Direct answers to questions about the poem's content.
    *   This question, requiring personal opinion and justification, goes beyond these typical exercises. It demands a more sophisticated interaction with the text and the ability to articulate a subjective response in English. Students might be more accustomed to identifying the *main idea* or *characters*, not expressing personal aesthetic preferences.

**Challenges and Mitigating Factors:**

*   **Challenge:** Articulating a "why" in English, especially with limited vocabulary and grammatical structures.
*   **Challenge:** The subjective nature might confuse students who are used to finding "the right answer" in the text.
*   **Mitigating Factor:** The rubric only requires "mentions why." This is less stringent than requiring a well-reasoned, grammatically perfect explanation. A simple "because it is nice" might qualify.
*   **Mitigating Factor:** If the poem is very simple and has a clear, positive message, it might be easier for students to pick a line and provide a basic reason.
*   **Mitigating Factor:** Students might simply copy a line and then add a generic "because I like it" or "it is good." This might meet the low bar of "mentions why."

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for *all* items, and the specific challenges of this question (especially the "why" component in limited English, and the higher-order thinking skill required), it's likely to be on the lower side of average, but not extremely low due to the leniency of the rubric.

I would estimate it to be slightly below the average pass rate, as the "why" adds
