Let's break down the question and its demands.

**Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** The most crucial prior knowledge is understanding the preceding reading passage (implied by "the king's questions"). This passage likely details the king's three questions and perhaps his motivation. Without understanding the passage, the student cannot accurately identify "the king's questions" and thus cannot give a relevant reason for their importance.
    *   **General World Knowledge:** The question asks about "real life." This assumes students have a basic understanding of what "real life" entails and can connect abstract ideas (the king's questions) to practical application.
    *   **Conceptual Understanding of "Importance":** Students need to grasp the meaning of "important" and be able to articulate why something holds value or significance.

*   **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Do you think": Relatively common and basic.
        *   "king's questions": Fairly direct, but relies on prior passage comprehension.
        *   "important": Common adjective, likely known.
        *   "real life": Common phrase, probably understood.
        *   "Give one reason": Straightforward command.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple interrogative followed by a simple imperative. Not complex.
    *   **Cognitive Load of English vs. Concept:** The language itself is not overly complex. The main language barrier would be if the *passage* containing the king's questions was linguistically difficult. However, the question itself ("Do you think X is important? Give one reason.") is relatively simple English. The challenge lies more in the *reasoning* aspect and linking it back to the passage.
    *   **Translation/Code-switching:** Students might internally translate "important" to, say, "महत्वपूर्ण" (mahatvapurna) and "real life" to "वास्तविक जीवन" (vastavik jeevan) or "असल जिंदगी" (asal zindagi). This is a common strategy and the concepts are fundamental enough to have direct Hindi equivalents.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **reasoning** and **application**, with a foundation in **recall** of the passage's content.
        *   **Recall:** Students must recall *what* the king's questions were. (The rubric helps here by explicitly stating them).
        *   **Reasoning/Application:** Students must then *reason* why these particular questions (about the right time, the right thing, the right people) are relevant or valuable in a "real life" context. They need to generate a reason, not just retrieve one directly from the text. This requires a small jump from explicit text to personal interpretation.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easier than complex analytical questions:** It's not asking for deep literary analysis or comparison of themes.
    *   **Harder than direct recall:** It's not a simple "Who did X?" or "What is the definition of Y?"
    *   **Similar to open-ended comprehension questions:** Many textbook exercises involve "Why do you think...?" or "Give a reason for..." type questions that require students to go beyond literal text recall and infer or apply. The specific questions of the king (right time, right thing, right people) are also quite universally relatable, making the "reasoning" part potentially easier than if the topic were highly abstract or culturally specific.
    *   The fact that *any valid reason* is accepted makes it quite forgiving, reducing the cognitive load of trying to find the "perfect" answer.

**Overall Assessment:**

The language of the question itself is quite accessible for Class 7 students, even with limited English. The core challenge will lie in:
1.  **Comprehending the preceding passage** to understand "the king's questions." This is the biggest unknown variable. If the passage was very difficult, it would sink this question. Assuming the passage was manageable for Class 7.
2.  **Generating a relevant reason.** While "any valid reason" is accepted, students still need to connect the abstract idea of the questions to practical life. The concepts of "right time," "right thing," and "right people" are fundamental and easily justifiable as important. For instance, a student might say "It helps us make good decisions" or "It helps us not waste time" or "It helps us choose good friends." These are simple yet valid reasons.

Given the average pass rate of 29%, this question seems to fall in the mid-range of difficulty. The simple language makes it accessible, but the reasoning component moves it beyond basic
