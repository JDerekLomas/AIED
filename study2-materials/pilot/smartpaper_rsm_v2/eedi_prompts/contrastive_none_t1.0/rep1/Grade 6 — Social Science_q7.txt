Let's break down the question for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Contrastive Analysis of the Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographical Knowledge:** Basic understanding that Rajasthan is a state in India and that it has specific geographical features and resources. This is generally covered in Class 5/6 Social Science (Geography) textbooks in India.
    *   **Concept of "Natural Resources":** Students should understand what natural resources are (things found in nature that humans use). This is a fundamental concept taught early in geography.
    *   **Basic Resources of Rajasthan:** Some familiarity with common resources found in Rajasthan (e.g., desert, water scarcity, specific minerals).
    *   **Influence of Resources:** The concept that resources affect how people live (e.g., availability of water affects farming, lack of water leads to specific adaptations). This requires a basic cause-and-effect understanding.

*   **Language Demands (English):**
    *   **"Mention":** A straightforward verb.
    *   **"Natural resources":** A key geographical term that students are likely to have encountered, even if their primary instruction is in Hindi, as it's a core concept.
    *   **"Found in Rajasthan":** Clear and direct.
    *   **"Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** This is the more challenging part.
        *   "Explain how": Requires articulating a process or connection.
        *   "influences": A slightly more complex verb, but understandable in context (how it *affects*).
        *   "lives of the people": Clear.
        *   "there": Refers to Rajasthan.
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary is not overly complex, but the "explain how it influences" part requires more than just recalling names. For students with limited English, *articulating* the explanation might be harder than understanding the question's intent. They might know the answer in Hindi but struggle to translate it into coherent English sentences.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **"Mention any two natural resources":** Primarily **recall**. Students need to remember specific resources associated with Rajasthan.
    *   **"Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** This involves a mix of **recall** (what is known about the resource) and **application/reasoning**. They need to apply their understanding of the resource's characteristics to how it impacts daily life in Rajasthan. For example, if they mention "water," they need to reason that scarcity of water leads to specific farming practices, water conservation, migration, etc. This is more than just rote memorization.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 6 exercises often include "Name two resources of X" or "What is a natural resource?" This question adds an "explain how it influences" component, which is a step up from simple recall.
    *   The "explain" part moves beyond basic factual recall and requires a simple analytical thought process, common in "short answer" type questions but perhaps slightly more demanding than single-word or fill-in-the-blank answers.
    *   The topic (Rajasthan's resources) is highly relevant to Indian geography curriculum, so the content itself is not obscure.

**Difficulty Assessment:**

*   **Easy Part:** Mentioning two natural resources. Many students will know about water scarcity, sand/desert, or basic minerals.
*   **Harder Part:** The explanation. This requires formulating a simple sentence or two in English connecting the resource to human life. For example, for "water," they might write "Water is less, so people save water" or "Farmers grow crops that need less water." Even simple sentences demonstrating this understanding would qualify. The challenge is in the *expression* in English, not necessarily in the underlying concept.
*   **Rubric Impact:** The rubric is quite lenient for the "mention two resources" part (e.g., "water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone... Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy"). This broad range helps. For the explanation, it just says "explain how one of them influences." As long as they provide a plausible, albeit simple, explanation, they should get credit.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

The 29% average pass rate across items suggests that many students struggle significantly with English and/or conceptual understanding. While the content here is relevant, the "explain" part in English will be a bottleneck.

*   Many will likely list two resources correctly.
*   Fewer will be able to articulate the influence clearly in English, even if they grasp the concept in Hindi. They might write fragmented sentences or simple phrases that show
