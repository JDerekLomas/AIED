Let's break down the question and its demands.

**Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** Crucially, students need to have understood the preceding reading passage (from which this question is drawn) that introduces the king's three questions. Without understanding *what* the king's questions *are*, it's impossible to answer *if* they are important.
    *   **Basic Life Concepts:** Students need to have a rudimentary understanding of "importance" and "real life." These are common concepts, but their application here requires a little more thought than just recall.
    *   **Formulating a "Reason":** This implies a cause-and-effect understanding or a justification.

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **"Do you think... important in real life?":**
        *   "Do you think": Requires an opinion/judgment, not just recall. This is a common phrase but can be tricky if a student is just looking for keywords to match.
        *   "important": Fairly common adjective, probably within their vocabulary even if limited.
        *   "real life": This phrase can be abstract. Students might understand "life" but "real life" implies practical applicability. It's likely understandable but slightly more complex than just "life."
    *   **"Give one reason":**
        *   "Give": Common verb.
        *   "reason": This is a key term. If a student doesn't understand "reason" (i.e., explanation, justification), they might struggle to provide the required type of answer, even if they grasp the first part of the question. They might just state *yes* or *no* without elaboration.
    *   **Overall Sentence Structure:** It's a question followed by an imperative. The syntax is relatively straightforward for English, but for a Hindi-medium student, the word order might be different from their native tongue.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application and reasoning** question, with a foundation in **recall** of the passage's content.
    *   **Recall:** Students must recall *what* the king's questions were (the right time, right thing, right people).
    *   **Application:** They apply the concept of "importance" to these specific questions.
    *   **Reasoning:** They must then formulate a "reason" or justification for their answer. This moves beyond simple factual recall and requires a degree of analytical thought. They need to connect the king's questions to general human experience.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises often focus on:
        *   Direct comprehension questions (Who, What, Where, When).
        *   Vocabulary matching/fill-in-the-blanks.
        *   Simple grammar tasks.
    *   This question, "Do you think... Give one reason," is a step up. It's an **inferential/evaluative** question that requires personal judgment and justification. While not extremely complex, it's less common than direct recall questions and demands more productive language use. The "why" aspect is often harder than the "what."

**Factors Influencing Difficulty:**

*   **Passage Difficulty:** The overall comprehension of the preceding passage about the king's three questions is paramount. If they didn't grasp the core of the story, this question becomes unanswerable.
*   **Vocabulary:** "Reason" is a critical word. If unknown, it's a major hurdle. "Real life" could also be a minor sticking point.
*   **Cognitive Demand:** Formulating a reason requires more than just finding a sentence in the text. It demands synthesis and expression of an idea.
*   **Instructional Focus:** If their English instruction heavily emphasizes rote learning and direct answers from text, open-ended questions like this will be harder.

**Example of a "Good" Answer (translated to simple English):**
"Yes, because everyone wants to do things at the right time and with the right people to be successful."
or
"Yes, these questions help us live better lives."

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29% across items):**

This question is slightly more demanding than average recall items due to:
1.  The need for reasoning/justification.
2.  The opinion-based "Do you think...?"
3.  The crucial vocabulary word "reason."

However, the underlying concept (the king's questions are practical) is fairly intuitive. Most people would agree they *are* important. The challenge is expressing *why* in English.

Given the average
