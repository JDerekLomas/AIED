Let's break down the question's difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have covered the Harappan Civilization (also known as Indus Valley Civilization) in their Social Science (History) curriculum, likely in Class 6 or 7, and potentially reinforced in Class 8. This is a foundational topic in ancient Indian history.
    *   **Specificity:** The question specifically asks about "urban planning," which is a distinct sub-topic within the study of Harappan civilization. Students might remember general facts but struggle to recall details specifically related to planning.
    *   **Comparison to Typical Curriculum:** Harappan urban planning is a major theme discussed in NCERT textbooks. Features like the grid pattern, drainage, and citadel are highlighted.

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Key terms:** "Describe," "key feature," "Harappan Civilization," "urban planning."
    *   **"Describe":** This is a common directive in exams and implies more than just naming; it requires a brief explanation.
    *   **"Key feature":** This is straightforward.
    *   **"Harappan Civilization":** This is a proper noun they should be familiar with in English, even if they study in Hindi (often transliterated).
    *   **"Urban planning":** This is the most challenging term. "Urban" refers to cities, and "planning" refers to design/arrangement. A student with limited English might understand "city" (शहर - shahar) and "design" (नियोजन - niyojan or बनावट - banawat) separately but struggle to connect them immediately to "urban planning." They might just default to recalling any fact about Harappan cities.
    *   **Rubric terms:** "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel," "lower town." These are specific historical/architectural terms that might not be easily understood or recalled in English by students with limited proficiency, even if they know the concepts in Hindi. For example, "drainage system" (जल निकासी प्रणाली - jal nikasi pranali) might be recognized, but "grid layout" (ग्रिड लेआउट - grid layout or जालीनुमा बनावट - jalinuma banawat) could be tricky.

*   **Type of Cognitive Demand (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **Predominantly Recall:** This question primarily tests factual recall. Students need to remember specific details about how Harappan cities were designed.
    *   **Low Application/Reasoning:** There's very little application or reasoning required beyond retrieving stored information.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Standard difficulty:** This is a very common type of question found in end-of-chapter exercises, unit tests, and even board exams for this level. Asking for "features" or "characteristics" of historical periods is standard.
    *   **Open-ended but specific:** It's open-ended in that *any* key feature is accepted, but specific enough to require knowledge of urban planning. This makes it slightly easier than asking for *all* features but harder than a simple true/false or multiple-choice question.

**Summary of Difficulty Factors:**

*   **Easier Aspects:**
    *   Topic is foundational and well-covered in the curriculum.
    *   Relatively straightforward recall question.
    *   Accepts *any* one key feature, offering multiple correct answers within the rubric.
*   **Harder Aspects:**
    *   "Urban planning" as a specific phrase might be a language barrier. Students might know the concept but not the English terminology.
    *   Limited English proficiency could hinder understanding the question's precise scope or recalling the *English terms* for features (e.g., "drainage system" vs. "naliyan").
    *   Students from economically weaker sections often have less exposure to English beyond the classroom.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

An average pass rate of 29% suggests that many students struggle with the general exam, which combines content knowledge with English comprehension. This question, while content-wise standard, adds a layer of English demand.

If the student understands "Harappan Civilization" and "city/town arrangement" (even if not "urban planning"), they might try to recall facts. The *ability to articulate one feature in recognizable English* is key.

*   A student who knows "नालियां" (drains) and can write "drains" or "drainage system" would get it.
*   A student who knows "ईंटें" (bricks) and can write "bricks" or "baked bricks" would get
