Contrastive Analysis:

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Grammar Concepts:** Students need to understand the concepts of "subject," "verb," "object," "active voice," and "passive voice." They need to know how to identify these components in a sentence.
*   **Verb Forms:** Crucially, they need to know the past participle form of irregular verbs. In this case, "blew" (simple past) needs to be transformed to "blown" (past participle).
*   **Sentence Structure:** An understanding of basic English sentence structure (SVO) is fundamental to manipulate it into a passive form.

**Language Demands (for students with limited English):**

*   **Vocabulary:** "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are relatively common words for Class 7 students, but "blew" as the past tense of "blow" might be slightly less universally recognized than some regular past tenses. "Leaves" could also be mistaken for the verb "leaves" rather than the plural noun.
*   **Grammatical Terminology:** The terms "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" themselves are complex English grammatical terms. While they might be introduced in their curriculum, understanding them in English can be a hurdle, especially if their primary language of instruction for grammar is Hindi. The concept of "voice" in grammar might be taught using Hindi equivalents, making direct transfer to English terms difficult.
*   **Idiomatic Expression/Phrasal Verb:** "blew...away" functions somewhat like a phrasal verb here, though the core meaning is straightforward.
*   **Understanding the Instruction:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" requires understanding of the instruction itself, which uses high-level grammatical metalanguage.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Application:** This is primarily an application task. Students need to apply learned grammatical rules (how to form passive voice) to a new sentence.
*   **Recall:** There is an element of recall in remembering the rules for forming passive voice (e.g., "be" verb + past participle, object becomes subject, optional "by" phrase).
*   **Reasoning:** While not complex reasoning, there is a logical sequence of steps involved in identifying the components, moving them around, and changing verb forms.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Sentence Complexity:** The sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is fairly simple in terms of vocabulary and structure. It's a common type of sentence used to introduce passive voice.
*   **Verb Irregularity:** The use of an irregular verb ("blow/blew/blown") significantly increases the difficulty compared to sentences with regular verbs (e.g., "The boy kicked the ball" -> "The ball was kicked by the boy"). Irregular past participles are a common stumbling block.
*   **Common Exercise Type:** Changing voice is a standard grammar exercise at this level, so students would have encountered similar tasks. However, the *specific* challenge of the irregular verb form is key here.
*   **Medium of Instruction:** If grammar is primarily taught in Hindi, understanding the English terminology and directly applying it to English sentences (especially with nuanced verb changes) is much harder than if taught natively in English.

**Synthesis for Indian Government School Class 7 Students (mostly from EWS, Hindi-medium, limited English):**

*   **Strengths:** Basic vocabulary ("wind," "leaves") is likely familiar. The concept of changing sentence structure might be introduced in their curriculum, possibly in Hindi.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Grammatical Metalanguage:** "Active Voice," "Passive Voice" will be a significant barrier. They might know the *concept* but not the *English terms*.
    *   **Irregular Verb Forms:** "Blew" to "blown" is a major hurdle. Many students struggle with irregular past participles, even in contexts where English proficiency is higher. This requires rote memorization of verb forms, which can be inconsistent.
    *   **Syntactic Transformation:** While the underlying logic might be taught in Hindi, applying it precisely in English (especially getting the "be" verb tense and agreement correct: "were blown") requires a strong grasp of English grammar that many Hindi-medium students will lack.
    *   **Average Pass Rate Context (29%):** This question requires a higher level of specific grammatical knowledge and application than many other item types that might contribute to a 29% average (e.g., simple comprehension, basic vocabulary identification).

**Likely Errors:**

*   Leaving the sentence as active voice, not understanding the instruction.
*   Failing to change the verb form from "blew" to "blown" (e.g., "The leaves were blew away...").
*   Incorrect "
