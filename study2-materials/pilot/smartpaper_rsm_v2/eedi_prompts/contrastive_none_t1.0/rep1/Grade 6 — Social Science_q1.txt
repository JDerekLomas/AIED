Let's break down the question for Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Basic geographical knowledge of India, specifically the concept of "mountain ranges." They would have encountered maps of India showing physical features, including mountains, in their Class 5 or 6 Social Science (Geography) textbooks. Names of major mountain ranges like the Himalayas are usually introduced early.
    *   **Not Assumed (but might be helpful):** Detailed knowledge of the formation or specific peaks within these ranges. The question only asks for names.

*   **Language Demands (limited English proficiency):**
    *   **"Name any two major mountain ranges"**:
        *   "Name": A very common and basic verb, likely understood.
        *   "any two": Clear and unambiguous.
        *   "major": Could be slightly ambiguous if their concept of "major" is different, but in the context of mountain ranges in India, the prominent ones are generally taught. They are unlikely to name a minor hill range.
        *   "mountain ranges": This is the key term. Students will have learned "पर्वत श्रंखला" (parvat shrinkhla) or "पहाड़ी श्रंखला" (pahadi shrinkhla) in Hindi. "Mountain" is often one of the first English words learned related to geography. "Ranges" might be a slightly less common word, but "mountain ranges" as a phrase would likely be familiar from maps or glossaries, or inferable from context if they know "mountain."
    *   **Overall:** The English is fairly simple and direct. The crucial terms ("mountain ranges") are likely to have a direct cognate or a well-known equivalent in Hindi, or are visually reinforced by maps.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is purely **recall**. Students either know the names of major mountain ranges in India or they don't. There's no application of concepts or reasoning required beyond retrieving stored information.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is **on the easier side** for a geography recall question at this level.
        *   Textbook exercises often ask for definitions, explanations of processes (e.g., how rivers form), or matching columns, which require a deeper understanding.
        *   Naming two major mountain ranges is a very fundamental piece of information they are expected to know from studying the physical features of India. It's often one of the first things highlighted on a physical map of India.
        *   The rubric also makes it easier by only requiring *one* correct name for a score of 0.5. Many students will know at least the Himalayas.

**Contrastive Summary:**

This question is straightforward recall, using relatively simple English. The core geographical concept (mountain ranges of India) is fundamental to their curriculum. Compared to the average pass rate of 29% for items on this exam, this question should be significantly easier due to its direct recall nature and the prominence of the information in their curriculum. The fact that they only need *one* correct name for partial credit significantly lowers the bar.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Given the factors:
*   Fundamental geographical knowledge.
*   Relatively simple English.
*   Pure recall.
*   The Himalayas are almost universally known.
*   The low bar for partial credit (one correct answer).
*   The 29% average pass rate across items suggests a mix of easier and harder questions. This falls into the easier category.

I estimate a significant number of students would be able to recall at least one major mountain range.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%**
