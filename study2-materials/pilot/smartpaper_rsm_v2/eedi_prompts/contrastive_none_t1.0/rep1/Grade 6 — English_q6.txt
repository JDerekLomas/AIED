Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Easy:** Understanding of a "poem" (kavita). They would have read poems in Hindi.
    *   **Easy:** The concept of "liking" something (pasand karna).
    *   **Moderate:** The concept of a "line" within a poem. While they understand a sentence, distinguishing a "line" in the poetic sense might be slightly different from prose, but context usually makes this clear.
    *   **Harder:** Implicitly, they need to have *read and understood the poem* to be able to choose a line and explain why. If the poem itself is complex or uses difficult English vocabulary, the difficulty of *this* question directly increases. *Crucially, the question itself doesn't provide the poem. We must assume the poem was provided and was at a suitable Class 6 level.* For this analysis, I'll assume the poem was comprehensible to them.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **"Which line...":** "Which" (kaun sa) is a very common interrogative. "Line" might be understood from context or by example.
    *   **"...from the poem...":** "From" (se) and "poem" (kavita) are common.
    *   **"...do you like the most...":** "Like" (pasand karna) and "most" (sabse zyada) are very common and often taught early. "Do you" (kya tum) is basic question structure.
    *   **"...and why?":** "And" (aur) and "why" (kyon) are fundamental.
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary and sentence structure are remarkably simple and common for English language learning. It avoids complex tenses, passive voice, or abstract nouns.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Students need to recall lines from the *provided* poem.
    *   **Application:** They need to apply their understanding of the poem and their personal preference to select a line.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the core skill. They need to articulate *why* they like a particular line. This requires some level of critical thinking and expression. The "why" demands a personal connection or interpretation, even if simple.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Compared to factual recall (e.g., "What is the name of the main character?"):** This question is harder because it requires personal interpretation and justification, not just memory.
    *   **Compared to simple comprehension (e.g., "What did the character do next?"):** It's harder for the same reason – the "why" component.
    *   **Compared to open-ended creative writing:** It's much easier, as it provides a clear structure and a limited scope (one line, one reason).
    *   **Typical exercises in Class 6 English often involve:**
        *   Filling in the blanks.
        *   Answering direct questions from a text.
        *   Matching words/phrases.
        *   Simple sentence construction.
    *   This question, requiring both choice and justification, is generally more demanding than the *most basic* Class 6 exercises but well within the range of more thought-provoking ones. The "why" part is what elevates it.

**Specific Challenges/Facilitators:**

*   **Facilitator:** The question is highly personal ("do *you* like"). This can make it feel less intimidating than a question demanding a 'correct' academic answer. Students might feel more comfortable expressing a simple reason.
*   **Challenge:** The *quality* of the "why" can vary greatly. A simple "because it is good" might score low, while "because it makes me happy" or "it describes my village" would score better. The rubric allows for a broad range ("mentions why").
*   **Challenge:** Even with simple English, framing a coherent "why" in English can be difficult for students who mostly think in Hindi. They might have the reason in their head but struggle to translate it into a simple English sentence.
*   **Facilitator:** The question is very common in language arts across many curricula (e.g., "What's your favorite part and why?"). The concept isn't alien.
