Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct knowledge of "fable":** This is the core assumption. Students would need to have been taught the term and its meaning previously, either in English class, literature, or through exposure to fables themselves (even if not explicitly called "fables"). They might have heard stories like "The Tortoise and the Hare" or "The Crow and the Pitcher" in their local languages.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Understanding "define" (to state the meaning of).
    *   **Conceptual understanding of "story," "animal," "character," "moral," "lesson":** These are relatively common concepts, even if the specific English words might be challenging.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Define":** This is a command verb that should be familiar from school settings, but it requires them to produce a definition rather than just identify one.
    *   **"Fable":** This is the key vocabulary word. It's not a common everyday word. While the concept might be familiar through stories, the *English term* for it might not be.
    *   **Producing a structured sentence/definition:** The rubric expects a somewhat complete sentence incorporating multiple elements. This requires not just knowing the meaning but also being able to articulate it grammatically in English. Many students might know the concept but struggle to form a coherent English definition. For example, they might think "animal story" or "story with a lesson," but struggle to combine them into a formal definition.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Primarily Recall:** This is a straightforward recall question. Students either know the definition of "fable" or they don't. There's very little application or reasoning involved beyond recalling a memorized or understood definition.
    *   **Slight element of application:** If they have a general understanding of the *characteristics* of a fable (animals, moral), they might try to *apply* those characteristics to construct a definition, even if they haven't memorized the exact phrase. This would still be difficult given language constraints.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Medium difficulty for definition questions:** A "define X" question is a standard type of exercise. However, the specific word "fable" might be on the harder side compared to more common literary terms like "poem," "story," or "play" which they encounter more frequently.
    *   **Harder than multiple choice/matching:** Producing an open-ended definition is significantly harder than selecting from options, especially with limited English.
    *   **Compared to *other English content at Class 8*:** Given the average pass rate of 29%, this question is likely *harder* than average. Many Class 8 English textbooks might introduce terms like "fable," "myth," "legend," but the depth of understanding and ability to articulate a definition in English can vary widely. If their primary exposure to "fables" has been through regional language stories, linking that concept to the specific English term "fable" and then defining it can be a significant hurdle.

**Summary of Difficulty Factors:**

*   **Challenging vocabulary:** "Fable" itself is not an everyday word.
*   **Production rather than recognition:** Requires constructing a definition in English, which is demanding for students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Reliance on specific instruction:** If "fable" wasn't explicitly taught and defined in English, students will struggle.
*   **Abstract concept (moral lesson):** While they understand "good things" or "bad things," articulating "moral lesson" precisely in English can be tough.

**Mitigating Factors:**

*   **Universality of fables:** The *concept* of animal stories with morals is quite universal across cultures, so students might have a foundational understanding even if they lack the specific English term.
*   **Commonality in literature classes:** "Fable" is a common literary term, so it *might* have been covered.

Considering all these points, especially the language barrier for producing a complete definition, the specialized vocabulary, and the general low average pass rate, this question is likely to be challenging. While many might recognize the *concept* if given examples, formulating the definition in English is the biggest hurdle.
