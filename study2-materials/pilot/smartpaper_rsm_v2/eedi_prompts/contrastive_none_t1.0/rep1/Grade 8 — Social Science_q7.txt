Let's break down the question for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have covered the arrival of European trading companies, the establishment of the East India Company, and the major battles that led to British dominance. The Battle of Plassey (1757) is a cornerstone event in Class 8 history syllabi (e.g., NCERT, state board books). They should know *what* the Battle of Plassey was (a conflict between the EIC and the Nawab of Bengal).
    *   **Less likely to be fully understood without explicit teaching:** The *mechanisms* of political dominance immediately after Plassey (e.g., puppet nawab, revenue collection rights). While the event itself is covered, the specific *contribution* to power expansion might require a deeper understanding of the political aftermath than just knowing who won.

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Keywords:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "British power," "India." These are likely familiar from textbooks, even if the surrounding text is in English.
    *   **Key phrase:** "contribute to the expansion of." This phrase is more abstract and requires understanding causality. "Contribute" might be challenging. They might understand "how it helped" more easily.
    *   **Rubric terms:** "political dominance," "control over Bengal," "puppet nawab." "Control" is relatively straightforward. "Political dominance" and especially "puppet nawab" (unless explicitly taught as a term) could be difficult to articulate in English.
    *   **Overall:** The sentence structure is declarative and direct. The vocabulary isn't excessively complex *unless* specific historical terms are unfamiliar. The main challenge will be expressing the answer clearly in English.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This question is primarily **recall**. Students are expected to remember the *consequence* or *outcome* of the Battle of Plassey as taught in their history lessons.
    *   It requires a slight degree of **reasoning/comprehension** to link the victory directly to the "expansion of British power." It's not just "who won?" but "what was the *impact* of winning on British power?" This is a step beyond simple factual recall.
    *   It is not an "application" question as it doesn't require applying a historical concept to a new scenario.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is very common as a short-answer or conceptual question in Class 8 history textbooks and exams. It's a fundamental understanding expected from this chapter.
    *   Typical textbook exercises might ask: "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?" (easier, pure recall), "What was the significance of the Battle of Plassey?" (very similar to this question, perhaps slightly broader), or "Describe the events leading to the Battle of Plassey."
    *   The rubric's expectation ("establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal") is exactly what textbooks emphasize as the *significance*.

**Synthesis of Difficulty:**

*   **Strengths (makes it easier):**
    *   The Battle of Plassey is a core topic, universally covered.
    *   The year 1757 is explicitly given, aiding recall.
    *   The expected answer (British control over Bengal, puppet nawab) is a standard textbook explanation.
*   **Weaknesses (makes it harder):**
    *   The phrase "contribute to the expansion of" might be slightly challenging for English proficiency.
    *   While the event is known, articulating the *specific political mechanism* (like puppet nawab) in English might be difficult for many, even if they understand the concept in their native language.
    *   The students are from EWS and have limited English, which will heavily impact their ability to formulate a correct answer, even if they have the knowledge. The gap between understanding and articulation in English is significant.
    *   The "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%" suggests a general difficulty in the exam itself and/or the students' preparedness/language skills. This question, while foundational, is still an "item."

Considering the *average pass rate of 29% across items*, and the language barrier being a significant hurdle even for known content, this question is likely to be answered correctly by a minority. Students might recall *who won* but struggle to explain *how* that led to power expansion in the precise terms expected by the rubric, in English. Some might just write "British won" which wouldn't get a point.

A student needs to convey the idea of
