Let's break down the question "Describes the poet’s writing style" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Understanding of "poet," "writing," and "style." They likely know what a poet is and that people write. "Style" might be a bit abstract, but in the context of writing, it's often implicitly understood even if not formally defined.
    *   **Crucially Missing/Weak:** Prior exposure to *analyzing* writing style. While they read poems, the curriculum at this level is more focused on comprehension, vocabulary, and basic literary devices (rhyme, rhythm, imagery, sometimes metaphor/simile) rather than metacognition about the author's craft or specific stylistic elements. They might not have the vocabulary or conceptual framework to think about *how* a poet writes, beyond just *what* they write. They might be able to identify a mood or a theme, but "style" is a higher-order concept.
    *   **Also Missing:** The *specific poem* or text they are supposed to be describing the style of. This question is decontextualized, which makes it harder. If they had just read a very simple, direct poem, it would be easier. If they had just read a complex, metaphorical poem, it would be harder. Without the context, they're left guessing what kind of style is generally expected or just drawing a blank.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Keywords:** "Describes," "poet's," "writing style."
        *   "Describes": Fairly common verb, likely understood.
        *   "Poet's": Possessive form of "poet," likely understood.
        *   "Writing": Common noun/gerund, understood.
        *   "Style": This is the trickiest word. While it has a general meaning in Hindi (e.g., "shaili" or "andaz"), applying it specifically to "writing" in an analytical sense might be challenging for students with limited English exposure to academic/literary terms. They might associate "style" more with fashion or a way of doing things, rather than the characteristic manner of a writer.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple declarative structure. Not complex.
    *   **Vocabulary for Answer:** The rubric suggests words like "simple, descriptive, informal, direct." These are relatively common adjectives. However, even if they understand the *concept* of "simple" writing, retrieving that specific English word to describe it in an analytical context might be difficult if their productive English vocabulary is limited. They might think of it in Hindi but struggle to translate it appropriately or think of a suitable English equivalent.

3.  **Cognitive Demand (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   This is primarily **Application/Reasoning**, but with a strong prerequisite of **Prior Knowledge/Conceptual Understanding**.
    *   It's not recall, as they haven't memorized a poet's style.
    *   It requires them to analyze (or pretend to analyze, if decontextualized) a piece of writing (even if imaginary or generic) and abstractly characterize its manner of expression. This is a higher-order thinking skill than simple comprehension or factual recall.
    *   Without a specific poem, it becomes an exercise in general literary understanding rather than specific textual analysis. They are being asked to apply a concept (writing style) that they may not have fully grasped or been taught to apply.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises focus on:
        *   Reading comprehension (answering factual questions about a text).
        *   Vocabulary (finding synonyms, antonyms, filling blanks).
        *   Grammar (tenses, parts of speech, sentence formation).
        *   Basic literary devices (identifying rhyme scheme, metaphors if explicitly taught and simple).
        *   Writing short paragraphs or descriptions based on given prompts or personal experience.
    *   **This question is generally more advanced** than typical exercises. Analyzing "writing style" falls more into the domain of literary criticism or higher-level English language arts. While they might be asked to describe a character or a setting, describing the *author's* manner of writing is usually introduced later or with much more scaffolding. The abstraction involved is higher.

**Impact of Economically Weaker Sections & Hindi-Medium:**

*   **Limited English Proficiency:** The primary barrier. Even if they grasp "style" in Hindi, finding the correct English analytical term will be hard. Their productive vocabulary for abstract concepts is limited.
*   **Lack of Exposure:** Likely less exposure to English outside school, meaning less reinforcement
