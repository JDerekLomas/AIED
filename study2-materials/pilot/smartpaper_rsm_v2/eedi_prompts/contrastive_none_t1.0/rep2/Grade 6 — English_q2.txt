Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Reading Comprehension:** The most significant assumption is that students have read a preceding passage or story from which this question is drawn. Without context, this question is unanswerable.
*   **Vocabulary:**
    *   "Who": Basic interrogative.
    *   "lived": Past tense of "live," common verb.
    *   "inside": Common preposition.
    *   "the book": Common noun phrase.
*   **Basic sentence structure:** Understanding subject-verb-object in a simple interrogative.
*   **Concept of "characters" in a story:** Understanding that beings or entities exist within a narrative.

**Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**

*   **Vocabulary:** The individual words ("who," "lived," "inside," "book") are fairly basic and likely within the vocabulary of a Class 6 student, even with limited English. They are common, high-frequency words.
*   **Sentence Structure:** "Who lived inside the book?" is a very simple question structure (Wh-word + verb + prepositional phrase). It doesn't involve complex clauses, passive voice, or abstract concepts.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric requires "a magical fairy" or "fairy." This implies that the source text explicitly mentioned this detail. "Magical fairy" would be slightly more demanding than just "fairy," but still manageable if the word "fairy" was present in the text. "Magical" itself is a common adjective related to stories.
*   **Ambiguity:** The question itself is not ambiguous. The ambiguity comes from the *lack* of the source text. However, assuming the source text is clear, the question's language is straightforward.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   This is a **recall** question. Students simply need to remember a specific detail (who lived in the book) from the preceding text. There is no application of concepts or complex reasoning required.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Easier:** This question structure is very common for comprehension checks on simple narratives. "Who is the main character?", "Where did X happen?", "What did Y do?" are staple questions.
*   **Less demanding:** It doesn't require inferential thinking, summarizing, identifying themes, or analyzing character motivations, which are often found in more advanced comprehension exercises. It's a direct fact retrieval question.
*   **Dependence on text clarity:** Its difficulty hinges entirely on how clearly the information ("a magical fairy lived inside the book") was presented in the source text and how easily students could locate it.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

Compared to other English content at the Class 6 level, this question's *linguistic demands* are quite low. The words are common, the sentence structure is simple, and it's a direct recall question. The main challenge for these students would *not* be the question itself, but rather:

1.  **Reading and understanding the preceding passage:** This is the biggest hurdle. If they can't understand the story from which this question is drawn, they cannot answer it, regardless of the question's simplicity.
2.  **Vocabulary within the passage:** While "fairy" and "magical" are somewhat common in children's stories, if the passage contained many unfamiliar words or complex sentence structures, comprehension would suffer.

Assuming the preceding story was also written with a Class 6 target audience in mind, using relatively simple English and a clear narrative:

*   The question itself is very easy.
*   The act of finding the specific detail ("magical fairy") in a simple, short passage should be manageable.

Given the average pass rate across items is 29%, a simple recall question with very basic language *should* perform better than average, *provided the source text was comprehensible*. The "29% average" likely includes questions with higher linguistic complexity, more abstract concepts, or multi-step reasoning.

If a student has understood the story even partially, this factual recall question is a prime candidate for a correct answer. The specific answer "magical fairy" is a concrete noun phrase, not an abstract concept.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 45%
