Let's break down the question's difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have covered the Harappan Civilization (also known as Indus Valley Civilization) in their Social Science (History) curriculum, likely in Class 6 or 7, and potentially reviewed or expanded upon in Class 8. Urban planning is a standard topic when discussing this civilization.
    *   **Potential Gaps:** While taught, the depth of retention can vary, especially if the topic was covered a year or two prior. Rote memorization might focus on names and dates rather than specific features of urban planning unless emphasized.
    *   **Comparison to Typical Textbook:** This is a very standard knowledge point. Textbooks often highlight these features with diagrams or specific paragraphs.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   "Describe": A common instruction, generally understood as "explain" or "tell about."
    *   "key feature": "Key" (important) and "feature" (characteristic/aspect) are relatively common words, but combined, they might be slightly more abstract than simpler terms like "one important thing."
    *   "Harappan Civilization": The name itself is a proper noun and should be recognizable even if English vocabulary is limited, as the topic would have been taught using this name.
    *   "urban planning": This is the most significant lexical challenge. "Urban" (city) and "planning" (making arrangements/designing) are individually common but "urban planning" as a compound noun might be difficult for students with limited English to fully grasp its meaning, especially if they haven't encountered it specifically in an English context. They might understand "city design" more readily.
    *   **Overall:** The phrase "urban planning" is the biggest hurdle. If students don't understand what "urban planning" means, they won't know what aspect of the Harappan Civilization the question is asking about, even if they know facts about it.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** This is primarily a recall question. Students need to remember specific facts about the Harappan Civilization's urban characteristics.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** There is no application or higher-order reasoning required. They just need to state a remembered fact.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Similar:** This question is very similar to "short answer" or "define" questions found at the end of chapters in textbooks. It's not a complex analytical question.
    *   **Slightly Harder (due to language):** While the content is standard, the specific phrasing "urban planning" makes it slightly harder than if it simply asked, "Name one important characteristic of Harappan cities" or "What was special about Harappan cities?" in simpler English.

**Synthesis of Difficulty Factors:**

*   **Ease:** The content is fundamental and frequently taught. It requires simple recall.
*   **Hardness:** The most significant hurdle is the English phrase "urban planning." If a student doesn't understand this phrase, they cannot answer the question, regardless of their knowledge of Harappan Civilization. The average pass rate of 29% suggests a general struggle with test items, and language is often a major contributor.

Given that students are mostly from economically weaker sections, attend Hindi-medium schools, and have limited English proficiency, the phrase "urban planning" is likely to be a significant barrier for a substantial portion. While they might have learned about "nagar niyojan" (urban planning) in Hindi, translating that specific concept to the English phrase "urban planning" on the fly under exam pressure is not trivial. Many might recognize Harappan Civilization but stumble on the specific focus of the question due to vocabulary.

The rubric accepts several distinct features, which is good, as it doesn't limit them to just one specific memory.

Considering the 29% average pass rate and the critical English vocabulary challenge, even for a standard recall question in Social Science:

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **25%**
