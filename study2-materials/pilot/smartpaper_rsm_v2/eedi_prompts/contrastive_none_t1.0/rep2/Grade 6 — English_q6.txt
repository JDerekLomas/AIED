Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their typical background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Literacy in English:** Students need to be able to read and comprehend the poem itself. This is a foundational assumption.
*   **Basic vocabulary:** The words "line," "poem," "like," "most," and "why" are all relatively common, but "poem" might be a bit more formal than everyday conversation.
*   **Understanding of "liking" and "preference":** They need to understand the concept of personal preference and being able to articulate it. This is a fairly universal concept, but expressing it in English is the challenge.
*   **Exposure to poems/poetry:** While they might have poems in their Hindi curriculum, their exposure to *English* poems and discussions about them might be limited.
*   **No specific factual knowledge:** This question doesn't require historical dates, scientific facts, or mathematical formulas. It's about personal response.

**2. Language Demands (for students with limited English):**

*   **Reading Comprehension (of the poem):** This is the biggest hurdle. If they struggle to understand the poem, they cannot answer the question. The difficulty of the poem itself is paramount here (though not provided, we must assume it's roughly Class 6 level).
*   **Vocabulary:** As mentioned, the question's vocabulary is relatively simple. However, the *vocabulary of their chosen line from the poem* and their *justification* will be the true test.
*   **Sentence Structure:**
    *   **Question structure:** "Which line... do you like... and why?" is a standard interrogative structure, but complex for a beginner. The "and why" adds a second clause requiring a causal explanation.
    *   **Answering structure:** They need to be able to extract a line, quote it (or paraphrase/refer to it), and then construct a simple sentence or two explaining their reason. This moves beyond simple recall to basic expressive writing.
    *   **Use of conjunctions:** To explain "why," they would ideally use "because," "so," or similar causal connectors.
    *   **Simple present tense:** "I like this line because..."
*   **Abstract reasoning/expression:** While "liking" is concrete, articulating *why* you like something requires a degree of abstract thought and the ability to translate that thought into English. They might *feel* why they like it, but struggle to find the words. For example, "It sounds nice" or "It makes me happy" are simple, but "It evokes a sense of peace" is far more complex.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Recall:** They need to recall a line from the poem.
*   **Application:** Not in a factual sense. It's more about applying personal preference to the text.
*   **Reasoning:** Yes, this is the core of the "why" part. It requires basic personal reasoning and the ability to articulate it. It's not high-level critical analysis, but it's more than just simple recall or identification.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Typical exercises:** Often involve multiple-choice questions, filling in blanks, matching, or answering very direct, factual "who, what, where, when" questions based on a text. These focus on comprehension and recall.
*   **This question:** Is significantly harder than typical recall/comprehension exercises.
    *   **Open-ended:** No fixed correct answer (for the "which line" part).
    *   **Subjective:** Requires personal opinion.
    *   **Requires justification:** This is the most challenging part. It asks for *expressive writing* and *basic analytical skills* in English. Many exercises might ask "What happened next?" or "Who is the main character?", but not "Why do *you* feel this way?".
    *   **Rubric considerations:** The rubric simply requires "denotes a line" and "mentions why." This means even a very simple "I like line 3 because it is good" could score. However, many students might struggle to even form that basic sentence.

**Additional Factors:**

*   **Confidence:** Students with limited English often lack confidence in expressing personal opinions, especially if they fear making grammatical mistakes. They might prefer to provide "right" answers rather than subjective ones.
*   **Teacher expectations:** If their teachers rarely ask open-ended "why" questions in English, students won't be practiced in answering them.

**Synthesis of Difficulty:**

The question itself uses simple vocabulary, but the
