Let's break down the question "Describes the poet's writing style" for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Implicit:** The student must have read *something* by a poet. The question doesn't provide a poem, so it assumes the student is familiar with the concept of a "poet" and "writing style" in a general sense, or that this question follows a text being presented. Assuming it follows a text, the student needs to have comprehended that text.
    *   **Core Concept:** Understanding what "writing style" means. This is a meta-cognitive concept about how someone writes, not just *what* they write. It involves recognizing elements like word choice, sentence structure, imagery, tone, etc. This is a relatively abstract concept for a Class 7 student, especially if they haven't explicitly been taught literary analysis terms in their language arts classes (which might be less common in economically weaker sections' schools).
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Poet's," "writing style." "Style" itself can have multiple meanings, and connecting it specifically to literary technique is key.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Keywords:** "Describes," "poet's," "writing style." These are not extremely complex words individually, but "writing style" as a phrase carries a specific, somewhat academic meaning.
    *   **Abstract Nouns:** "Style" is an abstract noun. Describing abstract concepts is harder than describing concrete ones.
    *   **Verb:** "Describes" is a straightforward verb, but the student needs to *produce* a description, not just recognize one.
    *   **Expected Output:** The rubric expects a single, relevant adjective. This requires understanding the question, processing a (presumably given) poem, and then *translating* their understanding of the poem's presentation into an appropriate English adjective. This translation can be difficult. For example, a student might understand the poem is "easy to read" but struggle to come up with "simple" or "direct."

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** and **Reasoning**.
        *   **Application:** The student must apply their understanding of "writing style" to a specific (implied) poem.
        *   **Reasoning:** They need to analyze features of the poem (word choice, sentence structure, imagery) and synthesize this analysis into a concise descriptor.
    *   It is not recall unless they are recalling a pre-taught description of a specific poet's style (which is unlikely to be tested this way).

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical Textbook Exercises:** Often focus on direct comprehension (e.g., "What is the poem about?"), identifying characters, setting, or basic plot points. They might ask about the meaning of a specific line or word.
    *   **This Question:** "Describes the poet's writing style" is a step up in cognitive demand. It moves beyond "what" to "how." While some Class 7 textbooks might introduce basic literary devices (similes, metaphors), an explicit focus on *analyzing and articulating* a poet's overall "writing style" using appropriate adjectives is often considered a higher-order thinking skill, typically introduced more robustly in Class 8 or 9, or in more advanced language arts curricula. For students with limited English and from economically weaker sections, this type of abstract literary analysis might receive less emphasis in favor of foundational literacy.
    *   **Open-endedness:** While the rubric provides examples ("simple, descriptive, informal, direct"), the open-ended nature of the question (requiring the student to generate the word) adds to its difficulty compared to multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blanks.

**Overall Difficulty Assessment:**

This question is significantly harder than the average Class 7 English comprehension item, especially for the target demographic.
*   The abstract nature of "writing style" is a major hurdle.
*   The requirement to generate an appropriate English adjective describing this abstract concept is challenging for students with limited English proficiency. They might grasp the *feeling* of the style in their native language but lack the vocabulary to express it precisely in English.
*   The average pass rate of 29% for the exam suggests a generally difficult set of questions. This specific question, demanding analytical and expressive skills at an abstract level, would likely fall below that average.

**Considering the Rubric:** "Identifies a suitable and relevant word describing the writing style (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct) or other appropriate word." This offers some flexibility, but the core challenge
