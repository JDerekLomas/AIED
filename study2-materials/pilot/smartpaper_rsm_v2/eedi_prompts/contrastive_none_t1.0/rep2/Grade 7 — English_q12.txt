Contrastive Analysis:

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Grammar Concepts:** Students need to understand the basic concepts of "sentence," "subject," "verb," and "object." Crucially, they must understand "active voice" and "passive voice" as distinct grammatical structures.
*   **Verb Forms:** They need to know the past participle form of irregular verbs, specifically "blow" -> "blown."
*   **Vocabulary:** "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are relatively common words, likely encountered even by students with limited English. "Change," "following," "sentence," "Active Voice," "Passive Voice" are meta-linguistic terms essential for understanding the task.

**Language Demands (for students with limited English):**

*   **Meta-linguistic Vocabulary:** The biggest hurdle here is the terminology: "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice." These are abstract grammatical concepts. While they might learn "kartri vachya" (active voice) and "karma vachya" (passive voice) in Hindi grammar, mapping these directly to English terms and applying the rules in English is a significant cognitive load.
*   **Instructional Clarity:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" is a direct instruction. If students understand the key terms, the instruction itself isn't syntactically complex.
*   **Sentence Complexity:** The target sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is relatively simple (Subject-Verb-Object-Adverbial). The vocabulary is common.

**Nature of Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**

*   **Application:** This is primarily an application task. Students need to apply a specific grammatical rule (active to passive transformation) to a given sentence.
*   **Recall (of rules):** They need to recall the rules for forming passive voice (Object becomes subject, appropriate form of 'to be' + past participle, 'by' phrase for original subject).
*   **Recall (of irregular verb forms):** Recalling "blown" as the past participle of "blow" is also a recall task.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Familiarity of Concept:** In Hindi-medium schools, students *do* learn about "kartri vachya" and "karma vachya." So the underlying grammatical concept isn't entirely alien. However, learning the rules and applying them *in English* might be introduced much later or less thoroughly than in English-medium schools.
*   **Complexity of Sentence:** The sentence itself is quite straightforward for a voice change exercise. It doesn't have multiple clauses, complex subjects, or unusual verb structures.
*   **Irregular Verb:** The verb "blow" is irregular, which adds a layer of difficulty compared to a regular verb like "kick" ("The boy kicked the ball" -> "The ball was kicked by the boy"). However, "blow" is a fairly common irregular verb.
*   **Common Exercise Type:** Changing voice is a very common grammatical exercise found in English grammar textbooks for this age group, even if the primary language of instruction isn't English. However, the *depth* of instruction and practice might vary significantly.

**Overall Assessment:**

This question tests a core grammatical transformation. While the underlying concept of active/passive voice exists in Hindi, the English terminology ("Active Voice," "Passive Voice") and the specific English rules for transformation (especially the correct past participle of an irregular verb and the use of "was/were") pose significant challenges. Given the average pass rate of 29% for *all* items, and the fact that this is a relatively complex grammatical concept requiring application of multiple rules and knowledge of irregular verb forms, it's likely to be on the harder side for this student population. Many students might struggle with either understanding the instruction or correctly forming the past participle and auxiliary verb.
