Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Easy/Common:** Students are very likely to have direct or indirect experience with rural life, farming, and animal husbandry, as many come from rural backgrounds themselves or have relatives there. Even those in urban areas would have learned about these basic occupations in earlier grades (EVS, Social Studies).
    *   **Expected:** Basic understanding of what an "occupation" is and what "rural areas" signify. They would know about Rajasthan as a state in India.
    *   **Less Common/Potentially Harder:** While "handicrafts" is a major occupation in Rajasthan, it might be slightly less universally recognized by all students compared to farming or animal husbandry, especially if their textbooks don't highlight it strongly. However, it's still a common topic related to culture and economy.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Main occupations":** This phrase is quite straightforward. "Occupations" is a common Social Science term.
    *   **"Rural areas of Rajasthan":** "Rural areas" is standard, and "Rajasthan" is a known Indian state.
    *   **"Describe any one in brief":** "Describe" and "brief" are simple commands.
    *   **Overall:** The language is quite accessible. There are no complex sentence structures, abstract vocabulary, or idioms. It uses common words often encountered in textbooks and daily life discussions about economy/society. Many students would be able to recognize keywords even if they don't grasp every single word perfectly. The structure is direct.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **Primarily Recall:** The question mostly requires recall of facts learned in Social Science chapters about different regions of India and their economies. Students would have studied about the geography and economic activities of different states, including Rajasthan.
    *   **Brief Application/Understanding:** Describing one in brief requires a minimal level of understanding and ability to articulate a few points, but it's not complex reasoning or problem-solving. It's more about recalling basic characteristics.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Similar Difficulty:** This question is very much in line with typical Class 7 Social Science textbook questions. These often ask for lists of features, reasons, or descriptions of economic activities in different regions.
    *   **Not a "trick" question:** It's direct and asks for foundational knowledge.
    *   **Relatable content:** The content (farming, animal husbandry) is highly relatable to their lived experiences or immediate environment, making it easier to recall and describe than more abstract concepts.

**Factors making it easier:**

*   **High relevance to daily life/surroundings:** Agriculture and animal husbandry are core to rural India.
*   **Simple, direct language:** No complex vocabulary or grammar.
*   **Recall-based:** Doesn't require deep analysis or synthesis.
*   **Standard curriculum content:** Occupations in different regions are a staple topic.
*   **Low bar for "correct":** Naming *any two* of the major occupations is sufficient, and the description can be very brief.

**Factors making it harder (relatively minor):**

*   Some students might only recall one occupation, not two.
*   If their specific textbook didn't highlight Rajasthan's economy sufficiently, or if they missed that chapter/topic.
*   Limited English proficiency could still cause issues for the absolute weakest students, even with simple language.

**Conclusion:**
Given the factors, especially the highly accessible language, the recall-based nature of the question, and the common knowledge about rural occupations, this question should be relatively easier than the average exam item, which has a 29% pass rate. Students are likely to at least name one or two common occupations.
