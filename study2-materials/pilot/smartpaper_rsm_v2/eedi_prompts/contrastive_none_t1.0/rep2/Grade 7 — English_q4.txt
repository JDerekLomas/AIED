Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, followed by an estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** The most significant prior knowledge is understanding the preceding story (likely "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy). Without that context, the question is unanswerable. Assuming the story was read and generally understood, the students would know *what* the king's questions were.
    *   **Basic Social Concepts:** Understanding the concepts of "importance" and "real life" and the ability to link the king's questions to these. This is generally within the grasp of a Class 7 student.
    *   **Opinion Formulation:** The ability to form a simple opinion and provide a single, supporting reason. This is a common academic skill, even if expressing it in English is challenging.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Do you think...":** A very common and relatively simple question structure.
    *   **"king's questions":** Direct reference from the passage.
    *   **"important":** A high-frequency, relatively common English word, likely encountered.
    *   **"real life":** A common idiom, but "real" and "life" are simple words that when combined are usually understood. The concept is relatable.
    *   **"Give one reason":** A very direct and clear instruction, typical of exam questions.
    *   **Challenge:** The difficulty will come not from understanding the *question* itself, but from *formulating an answer* in English. Many students might understand the concept but struggle to articulate a valid reason coherently in English. They might default to a very short, fragmented answer or struggle with sentence structure and vocabulary.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily a **reasoning/application** question. It asks students to take information (the king's questions) and apply it to a broader context ("real life"), then provide their own reasoned opinion.
    *   It's not pure recall (like "What were the king's three questions?").
    *   It requires a slight step beyond comprehension, moving into critical thinking, albeit at a basic level.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical textbook exercises for this level often include:
        *   **Direct recall questions:** "Who was the king?" "What did the king want to know?"
        *   **True/False, Fill-in-the-blanks.**
        *   **Vocabulary matching.**
    *   This question is slightly more demanding than a direct recall question because it requires an opinion and justification. However, it's not a complex analytical essay or a multi-step problem.
    *   It falls into the category of "comprehension and critical thinking" questions that are present in textbooks, but often appear towards the end of a chapter or as "think and discuss" prompts.

**Overall Difficulty Assessment:**

*   **Ease:** The question structure is simple, and the core vocabulary ("important," "real life") is accessible. The underlying concept (the value of wisdom/decision-making) is universally relatable. The story itself (The Three Questions) often has a clear moral message that encourages reflection on these very points.
*   **Hardness:** The primary hurdle is **English expression**. Students might *know* why the questions are important but struggle to articulate it in a grammatically correct or sufficiently detailed English sentence to satisfy the "valid reason" part of the rubric. The "give one reason" part is straightforward, but the quality of that reason in English is the key. The average pass rate of 29% suggests that even seemingly simple items are challenging for a significant portion of the cohort.

**Considering the Rubric:** "Any valid reason." This is a very lenient rubric. Even a short, slightly ungrammatical but conceptually sound reason (e.g., "Yes. Because know right time helps" or "Yes. Important for good life") would likely be marked correct, as long as the intent is clear. This leniency significantly increases the potential pass rate.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 40%

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

1.  **Story Comprehension:** Assuming the story "The Three Questions" was taught, a good number of students (likely more than the 29% average) would grasp its central themes. The king's questions are fundamental to the narrative.
2.  **Relatability:** The concept of making good decisions, knowing the right time, and choosing the right people is highly relatable to real life, even for young students. They would intuitively understand the "importance."
