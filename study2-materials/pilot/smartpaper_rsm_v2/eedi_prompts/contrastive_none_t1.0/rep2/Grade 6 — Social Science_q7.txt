Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographical Awareness:** Students need to know where Rajasthan is and have some basic understanding of its geography and resources. This is covered in Class 6 Social Science textbooks (e.g., NCERT "The Earth Our Habitat" or state board equivalents, often in chapters on India's physical features and resources).
    *   **Definition of "Natural Resources":** They need to understand what constitutes a natural resource. This is a fundamental concept introduced around Class 6 in geography.
    *   **Basic Understanding of Influence:** They need to connect a resource to its impact on people's lives (e.g., water scarcity leading to specific agricultural practices, marble for construction and livelihoods).
    *   **Specific Examples for Rajasthan:** While general knowledge of resources is expected, recalling specific ones for Rajasthan might be slightly more challenging than for a student living *in* Rajasthan. However, some prominent resources like desert/sand, marble, or water scarcity are often highlighted in textbooks when discussing different regions of India.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Mention":** Simple verb, usually understood.
    *   **"Natural resources":** Common term, likely taught in English, but the underlying concept might be clearer in Hindi (प्राकृतिक संसाधन - prakratik sansadhan).
    *   **"Found in Rajasthan":** Straightforward.
    *   **"Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** This is the more complex part.
        *   **"Influences":** This word can be tricky. It requires understanding cause and effect. A student might understand "impacts" or "affects" more easily.
        *   **"Lives of the people":** Clear.
        *   **"There":** Refers to Rajasthan, straightforward.
    *   **Overall:** The sentence structure for the explanation part is moderately complex. While individual words might be known, piecing together the "how it influences" part might be a hurdle for those with very limited English, especially if they are trying to articulate a nuanced explanation.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Mentioning two resources:** Primarily **recall** of facts related to Rajasthan's geography.
    *   **Explaining influence:** This requires a degree of **application** (applying the concept of resource impact to a specific region) and basic **reasoning** (linking resource presence/absence to daily life). It's not just rote memorization; they need to form a simple cause-and-effect statement.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Mentioning resources:** Comparable to "Name two resources found in X region" type questions, which are common and relatively easy.
    *   **Explaining influence:** This part elevates the difficulty slightly. Typical Class 6 exercises might ask simpler "Why is X important?" or "How is Y used?" This question asks for a slightly broader impact on "lives of the people," moving beyond just direct usage. However, the explanation doesn't need to be very elaborate (e.g., "Water scarcity leads to reliance on wells and specific crops like millets").
    *   **Rubric "Max score: 1":** This is a crucial point. A single point means the explanation doesn't need to be sophisticated. "Mentions two correct natural resources" is already the core of the rubric. The "explain" part might just be a tie-breaker or to ensure they didn't just list random things. Given "Max score: 1" and the rubric primarily focusing on *listing two resources*, the explanation itself might not be rigorously graded for depth, but rather for a basic, plausible connection. If *just* mentioning two resources gives full credit, the difficulty drops significantly. *Assuming the single point is awarded for simply mentioning two correct resources, as the rubric suggests this is the primary criterion for full score.* If the explanation is also required for that single point, the difficulty rises. I will proceed assuming the rubric statement "Mentions two correct natural resources... Max score: 1" implies that *this* is the primary criterion for scoring.

**Revised Assessment based on "Max score: 1" and rubric emphasis on listing:**

If the student just needs to list two resources, this is a straightforward recall question. The explanation part, while present in the question, seems de-emphasized by the single point and rubric wording.

**Re-evaluating based on the *entire* question for "Max score: 1":**
The question *asks* for an explanation. Even if the rubric seems to emphasize the
