Here's a breakdown of the question "Define fable" for Class 8 Indian government school students, followed by an estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis of "Define fable"

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Positive:** Most Indian students, regardless of background, would have encountered fables (like Panchatantra stories, Aesop's Fables) in their regional languages or Hindi. The *concept* of a story with animal characters and a moral is culturally ubiquitous.
*   **Negative:** They might not explicitly know the *term* "fable" in English, or have formally defined it. Their understanding would likely be experiential rather than definitional. They might know it as "moral story" or "animal story."
*   **Neutral:** They might know the *word* "story" and "moral" in English, but "fable" might be new or uncommon in their English vocabulary.

**2. Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**

*   **"Define":** This is a fairly common and high-frequency command word. Most Class 8 students would understand they need to explain what something is.
*   **"Fable":** This is the core vocabulary challenge.
    *   It's not a common everyday word in spoken English for this demographic.
    *   It might be present in a Class 8 English textbook, but perhaps not a high-frequency vocabulary item that's routinely drilled or used.
    *   Even if they've read fables, they might not have connected the *stories* they know to the *English term*.
*   **Required Output (Rubric):** "short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson."
    *   "Short story": Likely understood.
    *   "Typically uses animals as characters": "Typically" might be slightly challenging, but "uses animals as characters" is understandable. "Characters" is a common literary term.
    *   "Imparts a moral lesson": "Imparts" is a higher-level verb and might be difficult. "Moral lesson" would be understood, but "imparts" could be a stumbling block in forming a complete, grammatically correct sentence. They might substitute with "gives," "teaches," or "has."

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Recall:** Primarily recall of a definition. It's about remembering a specific piece of information.
*   **Light Application/Reasoning:** There's a very minor element of applying their existing knowledge of *what a fable is* (from their cultural background) to formulate an English definition, even if they don't know the precise English term "fable." However, without knowing the *term*, they can't answer the question directly.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Medium-High Difficulty for Vocabulary/Definition:**
    *   Typical Class 8 textbook exercises often focus on comprehension (reading a passage and answering questions), grammar, and basic vocabulary related to the texts.
    *   Direct definition questions like "Define X" for terms that are not explicitly highlighted as key vocabulary might be less common.
    *   If "fable" was a bolded vocabulary word at the start of a chapter, or had a glossary definition immediately available, it would be easier. Without that context, it's a test of whether they've internalized this specific English literary term.
    *   The conceptual understanding is easy, but translating that conceptual understanding into the *specific English word* and then giving a *formal English definition* is harder than just answering comprehension questions.
    *   The word "fable" is a literary term, which can be more abstract than concrete nouns or verbs.

**Contrastive Summary:**

The core difficulty lies in the specific English vocabulary word "fable." The *concept* is universally understood and culturally relevant. The *demand* for a formal, multi-part definition in English, especially including words like "imparts" or "typically," adds to the challenge for students with limited English. It's a vocabulary test more than a conceptual test.

## Estimated Proportion Correct: 15%

**Reasoning:**

*   **Baseline (29% average pass rate):** This question is likely more difficult than the average item on such an exam, especially given the English vocabulary challenge.
*   **Familiar Concept, Unfamiliar Term:** While students know what a fable *is*, many will not know the *English word* "fable." This is the biggest hurdle. If they don't know the word, they can't define it.
*   **Formulating a Definition:** Even if they vaguely recognize "fable," articulating a comprehensive definition in English, hitting all the points of
