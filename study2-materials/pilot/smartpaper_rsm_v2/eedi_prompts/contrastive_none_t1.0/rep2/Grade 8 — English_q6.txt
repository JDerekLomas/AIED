Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students are expected to have encountered the concept of a "fable" before, either explicitly in their English/Hindi lessons or implicitly through stories like those of the Panchatantra or Aesop's Fables (which are widely popular in India, often in translated forms). They might know the *stories* but not necessarily the *term* "fable" itself in English, or be able to articulate its definition.
    *   **Potential Gaps:** While the *concept* of animal stories with morals is familiar, the specific English *word* "fable" might not be universally known, especially if their textbooks or teachers primarily use a Hindi equivalent or simply refer to them as "moral stories." They might not have been formally taught to *define* literary terms in English.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Word "Define":** This is a common directive verb in exams and should be understood by Class 8 students.
    *   **Word "Fable":** This is the core vocabulary word being tested. Its familiarity is the main linguistic hurdle. If they don't know "fable," they can't answer.
    *   **Output Language:** Students need to articulate the definition in English. This requires basic English sentence construction and vocabulary to express "short story," "animals as characters," and "moral lesson."
        *   "Short story": Relatively simple.
        *   "Animals as characters": A bit more complex, but manageable. They might say "animals talk" or "animals are in the story."
        *   "Imparts a moral lesson": "Imparts" is probably too high-level. They would likely use "gives a moral," "teaches a lesson," or "has a moral."
    *   **Overall Difficulty:** The English required for the *definition* itself is not overly complex, assuming they know the core term. The challenge is primarily knowing the term "fable."

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **recall** of a definition. There's no application or complex reasoning involved beyond remembering what a fable is.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Textbook Exercises:** Typical Class 8 English textbook exercises in government schools often involve:
        *   Reading comprehension of simple passages.
        *   Basic grammar (tenses, articles, prepositions).
        *   Vocabulary (matching words, filling in blanks).
        *   Simple sentence construction.
        *   Answering direct questions about a story.
    *   **Comparison to "Define Fable":**
        *   **Easier aspects:** It's a single, direct question. The required output is relatively concise. The *concept* is culturally familiar.
        *   **Harder aspects:** It requires *explicit knowledge* of a specific literary term in English and the ability to articulate its definition. Many textbooks might focus more on *reading* fables or identifying their morals, rather than formally defining the term itself. If the term "fable" isn't specifically highlighted and defined in their English curriculum (or if it is, but they haven't revised it), it becomes significantly harder.
        *   **Rubric Demands:** The rubric's specific phrasing ("typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson") is quite precise. Students might give a partial definition (e.g., "a story with animals" or "a story that teaches a lesson") but miss one of the key components. Getting *both* key components (animals + moral) will be harder than just one.

**Considering the Context:**

*   **Economically weaker sections & Hindi medium:** This strongly suggests lower English proficiency. Familiarity with the *word* "fable" in English is the biggest hurdle. They might know "कहानी" (kahani - story) or "नीति कथा" (neeti katha - moral story/fable) but struggle to connect it to "fable."
*   **Average pass rate (29%):** This indicates a generally low performance across items. This question, while conceptually simple, relies on specific vocabulary and definitional recall, which might be weak areas.

**Likely Scenarios:**

1.  **Student knows "fable":** If they know the word, they can likely give a reasonable (though perhaps not perfectly worded) definition, probably focusing on "animals" and "moral."
2.  **Student doesn't know "fable":** They will likely leave it blank or attempt a very
