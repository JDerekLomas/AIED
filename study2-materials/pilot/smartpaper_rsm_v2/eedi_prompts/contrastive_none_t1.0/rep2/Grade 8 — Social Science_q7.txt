Let's break down the question for a Class 8 student in an Indian government school, considering the specified context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **The Battle of Plassey (1757):** Students are expected to know *that* this battle occurred and its approximate date. This is a foundational event in Class 8 Social Science (History) textbooks, especially those following NCERT curriculum which is common in government schools.
    *   **British Power/Expansion:** They should understand the general concept of the British East India Company's presence and its desire for expansion in India.
    *   **Political Dominance/Control/Puppet Nawab:** These are key concepts taught when discussing British administrative strategies. The example of Mir Jafar is explicitly mentioned in textbooks as a consequence of Plassey.
    *   **Contribution/Impact:** The question asks for a cause-and-effect relationship, requiring an understanding of how one event *led to* another. This isn't just recall of facts, but recall of a sequence of events and their significance.

*   **Language Demands (English Medium):**
    *   **"How did... contribute to..."**: This phrasing is moderately complex. "Contribute to" might be slightly more challenging than simpler terms like "What was the result of..." or "How did it help..." but it's a common academic term they'd encounter in English textbooks.
    *   **"Expansion of British power"**: This is standard terminology. "Expansion" and "power" are generally understood.
    *   **Vocabulary in Rubric (if they were to self-assess):** "Political dominance," "puppet nawab." These are specific historical terms that, while taught, might not be immediately recalled or fully understood by all students, especially those with limited English proficiency. However, the *core idea* of the British taking control of Bengal is what's crucial for the mark.
    *   **Overall:** The question itself is relatively straightforward in its English. The challenge would come more from recalling the specific historical details and linking them causally, rather than from decoding complex sentence structures. For Hindi-medium students, the entire question would need mental translation, adding an extra cognitive load.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   Primarily **Recall of understanding/significance**. It's not just "What was the date of Plassey?" (pure recall) or "If X happened, what would be the best strategy?" (application/reasoning). It requires recalling the *significance* and immediate *consequences* of Plassey as taught in their textbooks.
    *   It leans slightly towards **reasoning** in that they have to connect the victory to the *mechanism* of power expansion (i.e., by gaining control of Bengal, placing a puppet ruler). This isn't explicitly stated in the question, but must be inferred from their knowledge.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is a **standard, moderately difficult question** often found in textbook exercises or end-of-chapter reviews.
    *   It's more complex than a multiple-choice question on the date but less complex than an essay asking for a comprehensive analysis of all factors leading to British dominance over two centuries.
    *   It's a classic "explain the impact/significance" type of question for a key event. Many textbooks would have a direct question like "What was the significance of the Battle of Plassey?" or "How did Plassey help the British?"

**Factors Affecting Performance:**

*   **Curriculum Coverage:** The Battle of Plassey is *centrally important* in the Class 8 history curriculum. It's almost guaranteed to be covered.
*   **Teacher Emphasis:** Due to its importance, teachers likely spend significant time on this topic.
*   **Memorization vs. Understanding:** Students who merely memorized facts without understanding the cause-and-effect might struggle to articulate the "how." However, the core idea of British control over Bengal is usually emphasized.
*   **English Proficiency:** While the English is not overly complex, translating the question, formulating an answer in English, and using appropriate historical terms can be a barrier for Hindi-medium students. They might know the answer in Hindi but struggle to express it correctly in English.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** These students may have less exposure to English outside of school, less access to supplementary study materials, and potentially less home support for academic learning, all of which can affect comprehension and expression.
*   **Average Pass Rate of 29%:** This is a crucial benchmark. It suggests a high level of difficulty overall for the exam. A question that is "standard" might still be challenging given the overall context.
