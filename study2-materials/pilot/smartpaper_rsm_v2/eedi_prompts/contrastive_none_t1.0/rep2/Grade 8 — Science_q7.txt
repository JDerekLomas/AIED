Let's break down the question and estimate the proportion of Class 8 students in Indian government schools who would answer it correctly, specifically focusing on the "does the gardener notice any change" part for the provided rubric.

**Contrastive Analysis of the Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of decomposition/rotting of organic matter.
    *   Awareness that living things (microbes, insects, etc.) play a role in this process (though not explicitly asked for, it's the underlying reason).
    *   Understanding of the concept of waste and its eventual fate.
    *   Basic concept of soil health (though the evaluation part comes later).
    *   Implicit knowledge that time passes and things change.

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   "Collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits": Relatively straightforward vocabulary. "Waste" is a common word.
    *   "In a pit": Simple, concrete.
    *   "Does gardener notice any change after some days?":
        *   "Notice": A slightly more abstract verb than "see," but generally understood in context.
        *   "Change": Common word.
        *   "After some days": Simple temporal phrase.
    *   "Give reasons": Requires explanatory language.
    *   "Evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health": "Evaluate" is a higher-order verb. "Beneficial" is a slightly more complex vocabulary item. "Soil health" is a specific concept.

    **Focusing on the "Does gardener notice any change after some days?" part for the given rubric (max score 0.5):**
    The language for this specific part is relatively accessible. "Notice any change" is direct enough.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **"Does gardener notice any change after some days?"**: This is primarily **recall** of a very common observation (organic matter breaks down) and a simple **application** of that knowledge to a specific scenario (a gardener's pit). It doesn't require complex scientific reasoning at this initial stage.
    *   "Give reasons": This shifts to **reasoning** and more detailed **recall** of scientific principles (decomposition).
    *   "Evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health": This is **application** of knowledge about decomposition's benefits and **reasoning** about its impact.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Typical exercises:** Class 8 science textbooks often have chapters on waste management, decomposition, or soil. Questions about composting or the fate of organic waste are very common.
    *   **This question's difficulty:**
        *   **Initial part ("Does gardener notice any change?")**: This is equivalent to a very basic, introductory question. Most students who have covered waste management or even just observed nature would likely get this right. It's a fundamental concept often introduced early.
        *   **"Give reasons"**: This is a standard comprehension/explanation task, moderately difficult depending on the depth required.
        *   **"Evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health"**: This is a higher-order thinking task, requiring linking concepts and making a judgment.

    **Focusing on the "Does gardener notice any change after some days?" for the given rubric:** This part is *easier* than the average textbook exercise that requires detailed explanation or evaluation. It's almost a common sense observation for many, reinforced by basic science.

**Overall Assessment for the "Does gardener notice any change?" part:**

*   **Ease:** High. The concept of organic matter decomposing is very basic and observable.
*   **Language:** Relatively simple for this specific part.
*   **Cognitive load:** Low, primarily recall/observation.
*   **Cultural context:** Decomposition is a universal phenomenon. Many students would have observed this in their own homes/villages, perhaps with food scraps or animal waste.

Given the average pass rate of 29% across *items* on the exam, this *initial component* of the question is significantly easier than the average. The difficulty only ramps up with the reasoning and evaluation parts.

**Estimated Proportion Correct (for "Does gardener notice any change?" as per rubric):**

I estimate that a large majority of students would answer "Yes" or equivalent to the initial part of the question. Even those with limited English proficiency are likely to grasp the core idea of change over time for organic matter. The word "change" is crucial and accessible.

However, factors like:
*   Difficulty understanding *any* English words, even common ones.
*   Lack of specific scientific instruction, even for basic concepts.
*   Anxiety during exams leading to errors.
