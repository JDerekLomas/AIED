Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

### Prior Knowledge Assumed:
*   **Basic Geography of India:** Students are expected to have a foundational understanding of India's physical features, specifically the concept of mountain ranges and some major examples within the country. This knowledge is typically introduced in Class 5 or Class 6 Social Science (Geography) textbooks in India.
*   **Recall of Names:** They need to recall the specific names of at least two prominent mountain ranges.
*   **Categorization:** Implicitly, they need to understand what constitutes a "mountain range" to correctly identify one.

### Language Demands:
*   **"Name":** A very common and simple verb, likely understood even by students with limited English.
*   **"any two":** Clear and unambiguous.
*   **"major mountain ranges":** "Major" might be a slightly more nuanced word, but in the context of geography lessons, students are usually introduced to the most significant features. "Mountain ranges" is a core geographical term.
*   **"located in India":** Crystal clear and specific.

Compared to more complex sentences or questions with abstract vocabulary, this question's English is quite straightforward and uses terms that are often cognates or directly taught in geography. The language demand is low for a Class 6 student, even with limited English.

### Recall, Application, or Reasoning?
*   **Recall:** This is almost entirely a recall-based question. Students are expected to have learned the names of major mountain ranges in India and retrieve them from memory. There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning involved.

### Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:
*   **Similar Difficulty:** This question is very similar to a typical "fill in the blanks," "name the following," or "list two examples of" type of exercise found in Class 6 Social Science textbooks. It's a fundamental knowledge check.
*   **Not a High-Order Thinking Question:** It doesn't require analysis, synthesis, evaluation, or problem-solving. It's at the lowest rung of Bloom's taxonomy (remembering).
*   **High Frequency of Exposure:** Major mountain ranges like the Himalayas, Aravallis, Vindhyas, Satpuras, and the Ghats are very frequently mentioned and depicted in Class 6 geography chapters. Students would have seen these multiple times on maps and in text.

### Factors Making it Easier:
*   **Direct Recall:** No complex thought process required.
*   **Simple Language:** Low English proficiency barrier.
*   **Core Curriculum Content:** Mountain ranges are a fundamental topic in Indian geography at this level.
*   **Multiple Correct Answers:** Students only need to recall *any two* from a list of several prominent options, reducing the pressure to remember a specific pair.
*   **Partial Credit (Rubric):** The rubric allows for partial credit for just one correct answer, which significantly increases the chance of scoring something. (Though the question asks for two, the scoring on a *per-question* basis is often lenient in such exams, making it easier to earn *some* score for this item.)

### Factors Making it Harder:
*   **Memory Lapse:** Students might simply forget the names, especially if they haven't revised recently.
*   **Lack of Exposure/Poor Teaching:** In some very low-resource schools, the quality of teaching or availability of maps/visual aids might be poor, hindering initial learning.
*   **Confusion with Rivers/Plateaus:** A common error in geography is mixing up different physical features.

## ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

1.  **Fundamental Content:** Major mountain ranges of India are absolutely core Class 6 geography. It's like asking for the capital of India – a very basic fact.
2.  **Low Language Barrier:** The English is simple and direct.
3.  **Recall Only:** No application or reasoning skills are tested, making it accessible to a wider range of students who have merely memorized facts.
4.  **Multiple Options:** Students have several major ranges to choose from (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats). The Himalayas alone are so prominent that most students would likely remember them.
5.  **Average Pass Rate Context (29%):** While the average pass rate is 29%, this is across *all* items, some of which would be significantly harder (more complex English, higher-order thinking, less frequently taught content). This specific question is a "bread and butter" item for geography. Its relative ease should pull its individual pass rate much higher than the average.
