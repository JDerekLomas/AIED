Yes, the gardener will notice a change after some days.

**Reasons for the change:**

The waste of plants, vegetables, and fruits are **organic matter**. When these are collected in a pit, they are acted upon by tiny living organisms called **microbes** (like bacteria and fungi) that are naturally present in the soil and air. These microbes are **decomposers**. They break down the complex organic substances in the waste into simpler substances. This process is called **decomposition**.

During decomposition, the waste material will gradually:
1.  **Reduce in volume:** As the material breaks down, it shrinks.
2.  **Change in appearance:** It will lose its original form and turn into a dark, crumbly, earthy material.
3.  **Change in smell:** The initial unpleasant smell might change to an earthy smell.
4.  **Produce heat:** Decomposition is an exothermic process, meaning it releases heat, so the pit might feel slightly warm.

The final product of this decomposition is a dark, nutrient-rich substance called **compost** or **humus**.

**Evaluation of its benefit for soil health:**

Yes, this process is extremely beneficial for soil health. Here's how:

1.  **Increases soil fertility:** The compost formed is rich in essential plant nutrients (like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) that are slowly released into the soil. This makes the soil more fertile, leading to healthier
