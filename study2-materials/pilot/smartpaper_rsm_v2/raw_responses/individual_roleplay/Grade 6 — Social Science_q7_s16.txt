**Natural Resources in Rajasthan:**

1.  **Sand:** Rajasthan has a lot of sand because it has the Thar Desert.
2.  **Minerals:** Many minerals like marble, granite, and gypsum are found here.

**How Sand Influences People's Lives:**

The sand and the desert make life in Rajasthan different.

*   **Water Scarcity:** Because of the desert, there is very little water. People have to walk far to get water from wells or handpumps. They save water carefully.
*   **Houses:** People build houses with thick walls and small windows to keep them cool from the heat of the desert.
*   **Farming:** It is hard to do farming in the desert because there is not enough water. Farmers grow crops that need less water, like bajra.
*   **Animals:** Camels are very important. They are called the "ship of the desert" because they can travel easily on sand and go many days without water. People use them for transport and carrying goods.
*   **Clothing:** People wear light-coloured clothes and turbans to protect themselves from the sun and sand.
