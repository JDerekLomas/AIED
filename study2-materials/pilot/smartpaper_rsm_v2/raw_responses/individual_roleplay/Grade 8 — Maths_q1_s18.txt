**Question:** Find the value of `y` in the equation: `y + 9 = 4`

**Answer:**

Given equation:
`y + 9 = 4`

To find the value of `y`, we need to isolate `y` on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation.

`y + 9 - 9 = 4 - 9`

`y = -5`

Therefore, the value of `y` is **-5**.
