The line from the poem that I like the most is:

"The morning light is soft and new."

I like this line because it makes me feel happy and peaceful. When I read it, I can imagine the early morning, just after sunrise, when everything is quiet and fresh. The word "soft" makes me think of a gentle light that isn't too bright, and "new" makes me feel like it's a fresh start to the day, full of possibilities. It gives me a feeling of calm and hope.
