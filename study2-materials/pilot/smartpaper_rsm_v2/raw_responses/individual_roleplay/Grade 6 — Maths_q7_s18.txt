**Temperature of Jodhpur at 10:00 am = 30°C**

**Increase in temperature per hour = 2°C**

**Time duration from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm:**
From 10 am to 11 am = 1 hour
From 11 am to 12 pm = 1 hour
From 12 pm to 1 pm = 1 hour
From 1 pm to 2 pm = 1 hour
From 2 pm to 3 pm = 1 hour
From 3 pm to 4 pm = 1 hour
Total hours = 6 hours

**Total increase in temperature = Increase in temperature per hour × Total hours**
Total increase in temperature = 2°C × 6
Total increase in temperature = 12°C

**Temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 pm = Temperature at 10:00 am + Total increase in temperature**
Temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 pm = 30°C + 12°C
Temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 pm = 42°C
