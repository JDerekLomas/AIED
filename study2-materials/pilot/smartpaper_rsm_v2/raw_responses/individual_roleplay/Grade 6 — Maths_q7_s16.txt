First, we find how many hours from 10 am to 4 pm.
From 10 am to 11 am = 1 hour
From 11 am to 12 pm = 1 hour
From 12 pm to 1 pm = 1 hour
From 1 pm to 2 pm = 1 hour
From 2 pm to 3 pm = 1 hour
From 3 pm to 4 pm = 1 hour
Total hours = 6 hours

Temperature increases by 2 degree C per hour.
So, in 6 hours, temperature will increase by = 6 x 2 degree C = 12 degree C.

Original temperature at 10 am = 30 degree C.
Temperature at 4 pm = Original temperature + increase in temperature
Temperature at 4 pm = 30 degree C + 12 degree C = 42 degree C.

So, the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening will be 42 degree C.
