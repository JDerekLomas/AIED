The poet's writing style is simple and easy to understand. He use easy words so we can understand what he want to say. He also use rhyming words in his poems like A and B, so it is nice to read and remember. Sometimes he use some words that make a picture in our mind, like when he talks about nature. His poems are mostly about things we see everyday or feelings. He doesn't use very difficult sentences, they are short and clear.
