Yes, the gardener will notice change after some days.

**Reasons:**
The waste of plants, vegetables and fruits will rot and become compost. This happens because of small living things (microbes) like bacteria and fungi that break down the waste. This process is called decomposition. The waste will change its form and become a dark, earthy substance. It will also become less in volume.

**Beneficial for soil health:**
Yes, this is very beneficial for soil health.
1. **Adds nutrients:** The compost is full of nutrients that plants need to grow. When mixed with soil, it makes the soil rich.
2. **Improves soil structure:** It makes the soil loose and airy, so roots can grow easily.
3. **Holds water better:** Compost helps the soil hold more water, which is good for plants especially in dry weather.
4. **Increases helpful microbes:** It encourages more good microbes in the soil, which are important for soil health.
5. **Reduces chemical fertilizers:** If we use compost, we don't need to use too many chemical fertilizers, which are not always good for soil in the long run.

So, making compost from waste is a very good thing for the soil.
