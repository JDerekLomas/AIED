**Description of one occupation: Agriculture**

Agriculture is very important in rural Rajasthan. Farmers grow different types of crops like bajra, jowar, wheat, pulses, and oilseeds. Because Rajasthan is a desert state, water is a big problem. Farmers depend on rainfall or irrigation from wells and canals. They work very hard in their fields from morning to evening. They prepare the land, sow seeds, water the plants, and then harvest the crops when they are ready. Many families depend only on farming for their living.
