The Battle of Plassey was very important for the British. It happened in 1757.

In this battle, the British East India Company fought against Siraj-ud-Daulah, who was the Nawab of Bengal. The British won this battle because Mir Jafar, who was Siraj-ud-Daulah's commander, betrayed him and did not fight for the Nawab.

After winning, the British got a lot of power in Bengal. Bengal was a very rich province. They made Mir Jafar the new Nawab, but he was like a puppet in their hands. The British started controlling the revenue and administration of Bengal. This gave them a lot of money and resources.

This victory made the British much stronger and helped them to expand their power in other parts of India also. It was like the first big step for them to rule India.
