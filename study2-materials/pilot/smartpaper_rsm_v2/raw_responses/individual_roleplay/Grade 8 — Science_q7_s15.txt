Yes, the gardener will notice change after some days.

**Reasons:**

1.  The waste like plants, vegetables and fruits are organic materials.
2.  These organic materials will start to decompose or rot.
3.  Tiny living things called microbes (like bacteria and fungi) that are present in the soil will break down these materials.
4.  Because of this breaking down process, the waste will change its form. It will become softer, darker, and its quantity will reduce. It will also start to smell a bit like earth.

**Evaluation if this is beneficial for soil health:**

Yes, this is very beneficial for soil health.

1.  **Adds nutrients:** When the waste decomposes, it releases important nutrients back into the soil. These nutrients are like food for plants, helping them grow bigger and stronger.
2.  **Improves soil structure:** The decomposed material, called compost or humus, makes the soil loose and airy. This helps water to drain properly and air to reach the plant roots.
3.  **Increases water holding capacity:** Humus helps the soil hold more water, so plants don't dry out quickly, especially in hot weather.
4.  **Feeds good microbes:** It provides food for other beneficial microbes in the soil, which helps to keep the soil healthy.
5.  **Reduces waste:** It's a good way to use waste instead of throwing it away
