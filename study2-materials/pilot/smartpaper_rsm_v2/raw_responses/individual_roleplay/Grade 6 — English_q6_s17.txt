The line from the poem I like the most is "The wind is blowing, the leaves are falling."

I like this line because it makes me think of autumn. In autumn, the weather changes and it gets a little cold but it's nice. The leaves turn beautiful colours like red and yellow before they fall. It makes me happy to see the leaves on the ground and play with them. It is also a very simple line to understand and imagine.
