The line from the poem that I like the most is: "The little bird now learns to fly."

I like this line because it tells us about something new happening. The little bird is trying something for the first time, and it's a very important step for it. It shows that even small creatures learn and grow. It makes me feel happy to imagine the bird spreading its wings and soaring in the sky. It also teaches us that we should also be brave and try new things, even if they are difficult at first.
