One key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning was its **well-planned grid pattern of streets and houses**. 

The cities, like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, were typically divided into two main parts: the Citadel and the Lower Town. The streets in the Lower Town were laid out in a precise grid system, running straight and crossing each other at right angles. This created rectangular blocks where houses were built. The houses themselves were often constructed with baked bricks of uniform size and had elaborate drainage systems connected to the main street drains. This systematic layout shows advanced town planning skills.
