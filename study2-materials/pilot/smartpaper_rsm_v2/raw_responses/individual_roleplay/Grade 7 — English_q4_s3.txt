[This is what I'd write on my exam paper, trying my best.]

राजा सवाल

एक

[Explanation of my thought process, not part of the answer paper:]
I saw "राजा" and "सवाल" which I know mean "king" and "questions". I remember our teacher sometimes talks about a king in English class. Then I saw "एक" which means "one". I don't understand the rest. I'll just write the words I recognize and "एक" because it's probably asking for one thing. I don't know what "important" or "real life" means in English. I'll probably get zero marks, but at least I wrote something.
