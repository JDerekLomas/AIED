**Answer:**

The Battle of Plassey in 1757 was very important for the British to become powerful in India. Before this battle, the British East India Company was mainly a trading company. But after Plassey, they started to rule.

Here are some ways it helped them expand their power:

1.  **They got control of Bengal:** Bengal was a very rich province. After defeating Siraj-ud-Daulah, the British made Mir Jafar the Nawab. Mir Jafar was like a puppet in their hands. This gave British a lot of money and resources from Bengal.

2.  **Financial gain:** Mir Jafar gave a lot of money and land to the British. This money was used by the British to maintain their army and fight other Indian rulers. It made them financially strong.

3.  **Increased influence and prestige:** Winning the battle showed everyone that the British were strong. Other Indian rulers started to fear them. This increased their reputation and made it easier for them to make alliances or conquer other areas.

4.  **Military advantage:** The British army got more experience and confidence after Plassey. They also got money to make their army bigger and better.

5.  **Opening for further conquests:** Control over Bengal gave them a strong base in eastern India. From there, they could plan to expand their power to other parts of India, which they did in the coming years.
