First, we have to find how many hours are there from 10 am to 4 pm.

From 10 am to 11 am = 1 hour
From 11 am to 12 pm = 1 hour
From 12 pm to 1 pm = 1 hour
From 1 pm to 2 pm = 1 hour
From 2 pm to 3 pm = 1 hour
From 3 pm to 4 pm = 1 hour

Total hours = 6 hours.

Temperature increases by 2 degree C per hour.
So, total increase in temperature = 6 hours * 2 degree C/hour = 12 degree C.

Initial temperature at 10 am = 30 degree C.

Temperature at 4 pm = Initial temperature + Increase in temperature
Temperature at 4 pm = 30 degree C + 12 degree C
Temperature at 4 pm = 42 degree C.

The temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening will be 42 degree C.
