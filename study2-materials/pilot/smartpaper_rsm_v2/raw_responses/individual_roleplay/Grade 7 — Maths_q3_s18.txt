We know that the formula for the area of a triangle is:
Area = $\frac{1}{2}$ × base × height

Given:
Base = $8$ cm
Height = $6$ cm

Now, substitute the values into the formula:
Area = $\frac{1}{2}$ × $8$ cm × $6$ cm
Area = $4$ cm × $6$ cm
Area = $24$ cm$^2$

Therefore, the area of the triangle is $24$ square centimetres.

The final answer is $\boxed{24 \text{ cm}^2}$.
