Two natural resources found in Rajasthan are:

1.  **Sand**
2.  **Water (from rivers like Luni, and groundwater)**

**How Sand influences the lives of people in Rajasthan:**

Rajasthan has a lot of sand because it is a desert area (Thar Desert). This sand influences people's lives in many ways.

*   **Houses:** People use sand to build their houses and other buildings.
*   **Farming:** Because of the sand, the soil is not very good for growing many crops. People mostly grow crops that need less water and can grow in sandy soil, like bajra (millet).
*   **Travel:** It is sometimes difficult to travel because of the sand dunes. People often use camels for transport, which are called "ships of the desert" because they can walk easily on sand.
*   **Tourism:** Many tourists come to Rajasthan to see the sand dunes and enjoy desert safaris, which helps people earn money.
*   **Water scarcity:** Sandy areas do not hold water well, so there is often less surface water, and people have to dig deep wells or depend on limited rainfall.
