Yes, the gardener will notice change after some days.

**Reasons:**

1.  The waste of plants, vegetables and fruits will start to rot. This is called decomposition.
2.  Small living things like bacteria and fungi, and also earthworms, will eat this waste and break it down into simpler things.
3.  The waste will slowly turn into a dark, soft material. It will also reduce in size and smell a bit different.

**Is this beneficial for soil health?**

Yes, this is very beneficial for soil health.

1.  **Makes soil fertile:** The dark material formed is called compost or manure. It is full of nutrients that plants need to grow well.
2.  **Improves soil structure:** Compost makes the soil loose and airy, so roots can grow easily and water can soak in better.
3.  **Increases water retention:** Soil with compost can hold more water, which is good for plants especially when it's dry.
4.  **Helps good microorganisms:** Compost creates a good environment for helpful bacteria and other small living things in the soil.
5.  **Reduces waste:** Instead of throwing away the waste, it is used to make something useful for the garden.

So, it is a very good thing for the soil.
