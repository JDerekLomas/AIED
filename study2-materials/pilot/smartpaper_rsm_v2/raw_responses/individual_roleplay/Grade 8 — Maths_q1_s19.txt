`y + 9 = 4`

To find the value of `y`, we need to isolate `y` on one side of the equation.
We can do this by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation.

`y + 9 - 9 = 4 - 9`

`y = -5`

So, the value of `y` is -5.

Verification:
Substitute `y = -5` back into the original equation:
`-5 + 9 = 4`
`4 = 4`
The left side equals the right side, so our answer is correct.

Therefore, `y = -5`.
