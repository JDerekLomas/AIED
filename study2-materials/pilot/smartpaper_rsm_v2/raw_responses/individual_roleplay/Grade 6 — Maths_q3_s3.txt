[Your answer would likely be a blank space, or possibly a few numbers copied randomly, or a simple addition/subtraction if you tried to apply one of the only operations you know. Given the instruction to write as you would on paper, and the description of struggling even with Hindi and not understanding questions, a blank answer is very probable for an English math question.]

[No answer or a few random numbers]

**Possible answers reflecting the student's struggles:**

*   **(Blank space)**
*   **3367** (Just the first number copied)
*   **736** (Perhaps you recognize it's "smaller" because it has fewer digits, but don't know the term ascending or how to order the others)
*   **5492** (Could be the first number you saw, or just copied randomly)
*   **3367 + 5492 + 736 + 4799 =** (Attempting the only operation you know)
