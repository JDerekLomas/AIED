**Description of one occupation: Agriculture**

In rural Rajasthan, agriculture is the most important work. Farmers grow different types of crops. During the monsoon season, they grow crops like bajra and jowar because these crops need less water. In winter, if there is water available from wells or canals, they grow wheat, mustard, and gram. They use traditional methods like bullock carts for ploughing and also modern machines like tractors if they can afford them. Farming depends a lot on rain, so sometimes if there is not enough rain, farmers face problems. They work very hard in their fields to grow food for everyone.
