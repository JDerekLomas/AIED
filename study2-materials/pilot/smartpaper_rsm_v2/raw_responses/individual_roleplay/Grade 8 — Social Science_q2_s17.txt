**Harappan Civilization's Urban Planning**

One key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning was their **well-planned cities and streets**.

Their cities were often divided into two main parts:

1.  **The Citadel:** This was a raised area, usually to the west, and it probably had important public buildings like granaries or administrative offices.
2.  **The Lower Town:** This was bigger and to the east, where common people lived. The houses were built in a grid pattern.

The streets were very straight and cut across each other at right angles (like a cross). They were also very wide. Houses were built along these streets. This shows that they had a good understanding of planning their cities properly.
