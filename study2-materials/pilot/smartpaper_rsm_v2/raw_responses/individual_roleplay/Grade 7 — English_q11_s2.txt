[This is how a Class 7 student with the described difficulties might answer on an exam paper.]

**Question: Identify the adjective phrase in the sentence:**
**A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony.**

**YOUR ANSWER:**

बर्ड

[Explanation of the student's likely thought process:
*   **"Identify the adjective phrase"**: This part would be completely incomprehensible. "Identify" is too complex, "adjective" is an unknown English grammar term, and "phrase" is also beyond their understanding.
*   **"in the sentence"**: They might vaguely understand this means "in these words."
*   **"A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony."**: They would read the English words, but not understand their meaning fully or grammatically.
*   **Strategy for answering**: Since they don't understand the question, they'd look for a word that stands out or one they recognize, or just pick a random word. "Bird" is a concrete noun, perhaps one of the few words they might recognize from pictures or basic vocabulary. It's also a prominent word in the sentence. They might think the question is asking to point out *a* word from the sentence.]
