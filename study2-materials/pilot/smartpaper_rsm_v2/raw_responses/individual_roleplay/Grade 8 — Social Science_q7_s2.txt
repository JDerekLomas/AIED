[The student looks at the question. The words "Battle of Plassey", "1757", "British power", "India" are somewhat familiar from class, but the rest of the question is just a blur of difficult English words. They remember the teacher talking about a fight and the British winning. They try to recall something, anything, but the details are lost. They decide to write the few words they recognize and then try to connect it to something simple they understand.]

Battle of Plassey 1757. British jeeta. India. Badhiya.
