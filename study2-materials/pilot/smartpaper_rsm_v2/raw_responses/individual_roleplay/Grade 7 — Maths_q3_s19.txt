To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:

Area = $\frac{1}{2}$ × base × height

Given:
Base = 8 cm
Height = 6 cm

Now, substitute the values into the formula:

Area = $\frac{1}{2}$ × 8 cm × 6 cm
Area = 4 cm × 6 cm
Area = 24 cm$^2$

Therefore, the area of the triangle is 24 square centimeters.
