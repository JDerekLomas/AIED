Natural resources in Rajasthan are:

1.  **Water**
2.  **Solar energy**

Water influences the lives of people in Rajasthan very much. Rajasthan is a desert area, so there is not much water. People have to travel far to get water for drinking and for their animals. They build stepwells (baoris) and tanks to store rainwater because it is very important for them. Farmers depend on water for their crops like bajra and jowar, which grow even with less water. If there is no rain, people face many problems. So, water is very important for their daily life, farming, and animals.
