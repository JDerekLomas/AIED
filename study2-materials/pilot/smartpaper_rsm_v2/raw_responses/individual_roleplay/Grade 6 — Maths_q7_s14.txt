First, we find out how many hours passed.
From 10 am to 4 pm.
10 am to 11 am = 1 hour
11 am to 12 pm = 1 hour
12 pm to 1 pm = 1 hour
1 pm to 2 pm = 1 hour
2 pm to 3 pm = 1 hour
3 pm to 4 pm = 1 hour

Total hours passed = 6 hours

Initial temperature at 10 am = 30°C.
Temperature at 4 pm = Initial temperature + increase in temperature
