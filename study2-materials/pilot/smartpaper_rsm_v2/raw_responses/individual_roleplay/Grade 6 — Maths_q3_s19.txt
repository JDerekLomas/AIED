YOUR ANSWER:

First, I will look at the number of digits in each number.
736 has 3 digits.
3367 has 4 digits.
5492 has 4 digits.
4799 has 4 digits.

The number with fewer digits is the smallest. So, 736 is the smallest.

Now I will compare the 4-digit numbers: 3367, 5492, 4799.
I will compare the thousands digit of these numbers:
For 3367, the thousands digit is 3.
For 5492, the thousands digit is 5.
For 4799, the thousands digit is 4.

Arranging these thousands digits in ascending order: 3, 4, 5.
So, the numbers in ascending order will be:
3367 (because its thousands digit is 3)
4799 (because its thousands digit is 4)
5492 (because its thousands digit is 5)

Combining all the numbers, the ascending order is:
736, 3367, 4799, 5492

Final Answer: 736, 3367, 4799, 5492
