My favourite hobby is reading storybooks. I usually read in the evenings after finishing my homework, or on Sundays when I have free time. I enjoy reading because it takes me to different worlds and introduces me to many interesting characters. It also helps me learn new words and understand different cultures. Reading makes me happy and helps me relax.
