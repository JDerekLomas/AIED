**Answer:**

First, I will look at all the numbers and see how many digits each number has.

*   3367 has four digits.
*   5492 has four digits.
*   736 has three digits.
*   4799 has four digits.

The number with the fewest digits is the smallest. So, 736 (which has three digits) is the smallest number.

Now, I will compare the remaining numbers which all have four digits: 3367, 5492, 4799.
To compare these, I will look at the thousands digit first, starting from the left.

*   In 3367, the thousands digit is 3.
*   In 5492, the thousands digit is 5.
*   In 4799, the thousands digit is 4.

Comparing these thousands digits: 3 is smaller than 4, and 4 is smaller than 5.
So, 3367 is the next smallest, followed by 4799, and then 5492.

Arranging them from smallest to largest (ascending order):

736, 3367, 4799, 5492
