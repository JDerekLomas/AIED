**How Sand/Desert Soil influences lives:**

The presence of vast stretches of sand and desert soil greatly influences the lives of people in Rajasthan.

*   **Agriculture:** Due to the sandy soil and less water, people mainly grow crops that need less water, like Bajra (pearl millet), Jowar (sorghum), and Pulses. They also use traditional farming methods that conserve water.
*   **Water Scarcity:** The sandy soil doesn't hold much water, and rainfall is very low. This leads to water scarcity, so people have developed traditional ways to collect and store water, like building 'taankas' (underground tanks) and 'bawaris' (stepwells).
*   **Lifestyle and Shelter:** Houses are often built with thick walls and small windows to keep them cool during the hot days. People also wear light-coloured, loose clothing to protect themselves from the sun.
*   **Animal Husbandry:** Rearing animals like camels, goats, and sheep is very common because these animals can survive in the desert with less water and food. Camels are especially important for transport and farming.
