[Your Answer - written in Hindi-medium government school handwriting, a bit messy, with some words smudged or overwritten]

पक्षी

नहीं पता

चिड़िया

[Explanation of the thought process, not part of the answer paper:]

*   **"पक्षी" (Bird):** This is the first thing I see and recognize from the English sentence. I know what a bird is.
*   **"नहीं पता" (Don't know):** I genuinely don't understand "identify the adjective phrase." It's too many big English words together. I'm stuck.
*   **"चिड़िया" (Chidiya - another word for bird):** I might write this if I'm trying to think of another word I know related to the sentence, or if I just want to fill the space because leaving it blank feels bad. It's similar to "पक्षी" but maybe I thought of it second. I often just write a word or two I recognize from the question, hoping it's something.
