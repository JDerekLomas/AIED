My Favourite Hobby

My favourite hobby is reading story books. I like to read books about brave kings, smart animals, and funny adventures. I usually read books in the evening after finishing my homework, or on Sundays when I have more time. I enjoy reading because it takes me to new places and I learn new words. It makes me feel happy and relaxed.
