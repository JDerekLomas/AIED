[This is how I would write my answer on the exam paper, as a Class 7 student who struggles academically and has limited English.]

प्रश्न: एक त्रिभुज का क्षेत्रफल ज्ञात कीजिए जिसका आधार 8 सेमी और ऊँचाई 6 सेमी है।

उत्तर:

[Blank. I don't know the formula for area of a triangle, and the words "area," "base," and "height" confuse me in the context of the question. I know 8 and 6 are numbers, but I don't know what to do with them. I might just write nothing or try to copy something from a nearby student if I can.]

[If I felt pressured to write something, I might do this, but I'd likely leave it blank:]

8 + 6 = 14

8 x 6 = 48
