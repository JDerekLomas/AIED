One key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning was its **well-planned grid pattern of streets and excellent drainage system.**

The cities were often divided into two or more parts, with streets laid out in a grid pattern, intersecting at right angles. This created rectangular blocks of houses. Alongside this, the Harappans had a remarkable and elaborate drainage system. Each house had its own small drains which connected to larger main drains running along the streets. These main drains were often covered with bricks or stone slabs. This advanced system ensured that wastewater was efficiently carried away from the residential areas.
