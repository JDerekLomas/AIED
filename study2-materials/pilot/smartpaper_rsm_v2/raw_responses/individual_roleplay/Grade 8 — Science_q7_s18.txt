Yes, the gardener will notice a change after some days.

**Reasons for the change:**

The waste collected in the pit, which includes plant parts, vegetables, and fruits, is organic matter. This organic matter will undergo decomposition.
*   **Microorganisms:** There are many tiny living organisms like bacteria and fungi present in the soil and on the waste itself. These microorganisms act as decomposers.
*   **Breakdown:** The decomposers break down the complex organic substances in the waste into simpler substances.
*   **Compost Formation:** Over time, this process of decomposition will convert the waste into a dark, nutrient-rich substance called compost or manure.
*   **Appearance:** The gardener will notice that the original waste items will shrink, change colour (become darker), lose their original shape and smell, and eventually turn into a crumbly, earthy material.

**Evaluation of benefits for soil health:**

Yes, this process is highly beneficial for soil health.

1.  **Increases Soil Fertility:** The compost formed is rich in essential plant nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. When added to the soil, it slowly releases these nutrients, making the soil more fertile and promoting healthy plant growth.
2.  **Improves Soil Structure:** Compost makes the soil more crumbly and aerated. In sandy soils, it helps hold water and nutrients better. In clayey soils, it helps to loosen the soil, improving drainage
