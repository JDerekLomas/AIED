My favourite hobby is reading storybooks. I usually read in the evenings, after finishing my homework, or sometimes on Sundays when I have free time. I enjoy reading because it takes me to different worlds and introduces me to new characters and ideas. It helps me learn new words and imagine things, which makes me very happy.
