Two natural resources in Rajasthan are **sand** and **water**.

**Water** influences the lives of the people there very much. Rajasthan is a desert area, so water is very less. People have to go far to get water. They use water for drinking, cooking, and for their animals. Because water is less, they grow crops that need less water, like bajra and jowar. They also wear clothes that are light to stay cool because of less water and more heat. People also build houses with thick walls to keep cool. Because water is so important, people celebrate festivals related to water and rain.
