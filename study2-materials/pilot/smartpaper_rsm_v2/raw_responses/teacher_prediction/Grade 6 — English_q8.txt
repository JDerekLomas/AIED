This is a common sentence structure we practice, but the challenges are real. Here's my breakdown:

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   **Language barriers:** Many would struggle to even recognize all the words, let alone understand their individual meanings. "Reading" and "book" might be familiar through pictures or limited exposure, but "is" and "a" would be challenging in isolation.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires reasoning about sentence structure, which is very difficult if word recognition is low. They might try to just string words together randomly.
    *   **Common mistakes:** Random order, missing words, or just writing down a few words they recognize.
    *   **Prediction:** I'd be very surprised if more than a handful got this perfect.
    **struggling: 5% full marks**

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   **Language barriers:** They would likely recognize most, if not all, the words. They might understand "he" as a boy, "book" as a book, and "reading" as an action. "Is" and "a" are still tricky but they might have encountered them in simple sentences.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They've seen simple sentences before, so there's some recall, but they still need to reason about the correct order (subject-verb-object). They might struggle with putting "is" in the right place or realize "a" goes before "book."
    *   **Common mistakes:** "He reading a book" (missing 'is'), "Book is he reading a," or "A book he is reading." They might get the main subject and object but struggle with the auxiliary verb and article placement.
    **basic: 40% full marks**

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   **Language barriers:** They would understand all the words and their individual meanings.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They have a good grasp of basic English sentence structure (SVO). This is a very common structure they would have practiced and internalized.
    *   **Common mistakes:** Very few mistakes for this type of sentence. They might pause briefly to confirm the order but would likely get it right.
    **competent: 90% full marks**

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   **Language barriers:** No issues here.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is a straightforward task for them. They would immediately identify the correct structure.
    *   **Common mistakes:** None. They would get this correct almost instantly.
