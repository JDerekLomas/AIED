Okay, this is a classic recall question for Class 8 Social Science, specifically from the History section on Ancient Civilizations. Given the student profile, here's my breakdown:

**Thinking Process:**

1.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall. Students either remember the features of Harappan urban planning or they don't. There's no reasoning or application involved.
2.  **Specificity:** The rubric requires *one key feature* and gives examples. This is good because it allows for a few different correct answers.
3.  **Language Barriers:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Describe one key feature" is a relatively straightforward instruction, but the *content* itself might be an issue. If they haven't grasped the English terms like "urban planning," "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel," or "lower town," they'll struggle to articulate the answer even if they conceptually understand it in Hindi.
4.  **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Misunderstanding "urban planning":** They might just list *any* feature of Harappan civilization (e.g., they grew crops, they traded).
    *   **Lack of precise vocabulary:** They might know about the "naali" (drainage) but struggle to write "advanced drainage system" in English. They might know about "pakki eent" (baked bricks) but not be able to phrase it correctly.
    *   **Incomplete answers:** "Streets were straight" instead of "well-planned grid layout of streets."
    *   **Confusion with other civilizations:** Less likely at this stage, but sometimes they mix up features.
    *   **Simply not remembering:** This is the most common for the struggling and basic groups.

**Percentage Breakdown:**

*   **Struggling (35% of total):** These students often have significant difficulty with reading comprehension in English and recalling specific facts. Even if we've taught this in Hindi, translating their understanding into a correct English sentence is a huge challenge. They might remember "naali" but struggle to write "advanced drainage system."
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks** (This 5% would be those who either have a slightly better grasp of English than their peers in this group, or have exceptionally strong recall and managed to memorize a key phrase.)

*   **Basic (35% of total):** This group understands core concepts but struggles with detail and precise articulation, especially in English. They might remember "cities were planned" or "they had good drains," but articulating it as a "well-planned grid layout" or "advanced drainage system using baked bricks" might be just out of reach. They might get partial credit in a more lenient scoring, but full marks for a specific, well-articulated feature is tough.
    *   **basic: 25% full marks** (Some will manage to recall one of the simpler phrases like "good drainage system" or "baked bricks were used." Others might remember the concept but struggle with the exact English phrasing for "grid layout.")

*   **Competent (20% of total):** These students generally understand the material, can recall facts, and have decent English proficiency for their grade level. They would have been able to identify and state one key feature accurately. They've likely internalized the vocabulary.
    *   **competent: 80% full marks** (Most of them will nail this. A few might make a minor error in phrasing or forget a specific detail, but the majority will get full marks.)

*   **Advanced (10% of total):** These students are strong academically, have good recall, and are generally proficient in English. This question would be straightforward for them.
    *   **advanced: 95% full marks** (Almost all of them will get this correct. The 5% margin accounts for a rare lapse of memory or a silly mistake.)
