This is a great question that probes both comprehension and critical thinking, which can be challenging for our diverse Class 7 students.

Let's break down the question and the rubric:

*   **Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."
*   **Rubric:** The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason. Max score: 1.

**Analysis from an Indian Government School Class 7 Teacher's Perspective:**

1.  **Language Barriers (Reading):** The question itself is not overly complex in terms of vocabulary, but for the struggling students, even "important in real life" might be a slight hurdle. They might be able to pick out "king's questions" if we've discussed them thoroughly, but connecting it to "real life" requires a level of abstract thinking they might not possess in English.
2.  **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires *both* recall and reasoning.
    *   **Recall:** Students need to recall *what* the king's questions were (implicitly, to understand *why* they might be important). The rubric explicitly mentions "based on the reading passage," indicating that understanding the content is foundational.
    *   **Reasoning:** They then need to apply that understanding to a "real life" context and provide a *reason*. This is the higher-order thinking part.
3.  **Specificity of the Required Answer:** The rubric is quite generous ("Any valid reason"). This is a huge advantage. It doesn't demand a specific phrasing or a deeply philosophical answer. A simple, correct reason would suffice (e.g., "Yes, because we need to know what to do," "Yes, because it helps us make good decisions," "Yes, because it helps us succeed").
4.  **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Simply saying "Yes" or "No" without a reason:** This is very common, especially among struggling and basic students who understand the "yes/no" part but can't formulate the "why."
    *   **Struggling to articulate the reason in English:** Even if they have the thought in Hindi, translating it into coherent English can be a major block.
    *   **Misinterpreting "real life":** Some might struggle to connect the fictional king's dilemma to their own experiences.
    *   **Focusing on trivial details from the story:** Instead of the core meaning of the questions, they might mention something tangential.
    *   **Not attempting the reason part:** Leaving it blank is a common outcome for those who are unsure.

Here's my estimation for full marks:

*   **Struggling (35%):** **5% full marks**
    *   Most will struggle to read and fully comprehend the question. Even if they understand "king's questions," connecting it to "real life" and then articulating a reason in English will be extremely difficult. A few might get lucky with a very simple, short phrase that counts as a valid reason, but it would be rare. Many would just write "Yes" or nothing for the reason.
*   **Basic (35%):** **30% full marks**
    *   They can usually read the question with some effort. They will likely understand the core of the king's questions from the passage. The challenge will be formulating a *reason* in English. Many might write a very short, perhaps grammatically imperfect, but conceptually valid reason (e.g., "Yes, for good life," "Yes, to make right choice"). They have the conceptual understanding but limited expressive ability.
*   **Competent (20%):** **80% full marks**
    *   They will read and understand the question easily. They will grasp the importance of the king's questions from the text. They have enough English vocabulary and sentence structure to articulate a valid reason clearly. They might say something like, "Yes, because knowing the right time and people helps us make good decisions and succeed in life."
*   **Advanced (10%):** **95% full marks**
    *   They will not only understand but also appreciate the philosophical depth of the question. They will articulate a well-reasoned answer with good English. They might even elaborate slightly more than required, demonstrating a deeper understanding. The only reason it's not 100% is due to potential oversight or a momentary lapse in focus, not lack of ability.
