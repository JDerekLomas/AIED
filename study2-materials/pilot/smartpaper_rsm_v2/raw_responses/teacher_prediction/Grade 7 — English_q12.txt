This is a common grammar transformation, but given the specific context of an Indian government school, Class 7, with students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the success rate will vary significantly across ability levels.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling:** 0-5% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** Many wouldn't understand the question itself ("Change from Active Voice to Passive Voice"). The words "active" and "passive" are abstract grammatical terms that often aren't fully grasped, even if taught.
*   **Reading difficulty:** Even if they know the concept, reading "The wind blew the leaves away" might be slow and they might miss the core action or subject.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires both recall of the passive voice structure (object + 'be' verb + past participle + by + subject) and applying it correctly. For struggling students, this is a complex multi-step process.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might just rearrange words randomly, keep the same verb form, or misunderstand the subject/object. They might write "The leaves blew away by the wind" or "The leaves was blow by the wind."

**basic:** 15-25% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They might understand the *gist* of the question if it's been taught recently and reinforced, but the technical terms might still be fuzzy.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall parts of the passive structure but struggle with the correct form of "be" (was/were) and the past participle ("blown").
*   **Common mistakes:** "The leaves was blown away by the wind" (subject-verb agreement error), "The leaves were blow away by the wind" (incorrect past participle), or "The leaves blown away by the wind" (missing 'be' verb). They might also omit "by the wind."

**competent:** 60-75% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** They would understand the question and the sentence.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would have a good grasp of the passive voice structure and the past participle forms of common verbs. They might pause to think about "was" vs. "were."
*   **Common mistakes:** A minor oversight, like forgetting "by the wind" (though the rubric specifies "by the wind" is part of the correct transformation, some might simplify to "The leaves were blown away"). Or a momentary lapse in subject-verb agreement if they're rushing.

**advanced:** 90-100% full marks
*   **Language barriers:** No issues here.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would instantly recognize the active voice and correctly apply the passive voice transformation, including the correct past participle and subject-verb agreement. This is a routine exercise for them.
*   **Common mistakes:** Extremely rare, perhaps a single spelling error if they're not careful.
