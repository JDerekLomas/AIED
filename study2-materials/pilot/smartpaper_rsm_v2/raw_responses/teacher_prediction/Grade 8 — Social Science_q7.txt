This is a great question that really makes me think about my students! Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They would struggle immensely just to understand the question itself, let alone formulate an answer in English. "Contribute to the expansion" would be a major hurdle.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires recall of a specific consequence, not just a general idea. They might remember "Battle of Plassey" and "British won," but connecting it to "political dominance/control over Bengal" and "puppet nawab" is too specific.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They'd likely just write "British won" or "Mir Jafar became Nawab," without explaining the *significance* for British power.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Some might grasp the core of the question ("how Plassey helped British power").
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall that Mir Jafar was made Nawab. However, the crucial part is explaining *how that contributed to British power* – the "puppet" aspect, or the *control* over Bengal. Many would state Mir Jafar became Nawab but not explicitly link it to British political control.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They'd often say "British won and got rich" or "British got control of Bengal" but miss the specific mechanism (puppet Nawab). The requirement for "political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)" is quite specific. Some might say "Mir Jafar became Nawab" but not elaborate on the *implication* of that for British power.

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Most would understand the question reasonably well.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would likely recall Mir Jafar becoming the puppet Nawab. They'd also have a better chance of connecting this to British control over Bengal's resources and administration, even if indirectly. The "e.g." in the rubric helps here; if they state the main point about political dominance, they're good.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Some might describe the economic benefits (revenue collection) more than the *political dominance*, or they might struggle to articulate the "puppet" aspect clearly in English.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would not only recall the facts but also understand the political implications. They would clearly state that the British gained political control over Bengal by installing Mir Jafar as a puppet ruler, thereby gaining access to resources and administrative influence.
*   **Common Mistakes:** A very minor chance of not being specific enough if they rush, or focusing slightly more on economic gains rather than political dominance, but generally, they'd hit the mark.
