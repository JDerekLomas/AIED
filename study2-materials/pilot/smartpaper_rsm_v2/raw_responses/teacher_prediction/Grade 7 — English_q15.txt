Here's my assessment based on my experience:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 20% full marks
competent: 70% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**

*   **Struggling (35% of students):** These students often struggle with basic sentence construction, vocabulary, and understanding the prompt itself. Many would write 1-2 fragmented sentences, or just a list of words. They might state their hobby but miss "when" or "why," or use very incorrect grammar. The "4-5 sentences" requirement would be a significant hurdle. Even if they understand the individual parts (hobby, when, why), putting it into a cohesive paragraph with correct sentence structure is too much for most.

*   **Basic (35% of students):** These students would likely understand the prompt and attempt to answer all parts. However, their paragraph might be grammatically shaky, with common errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and prepositions. They might write 3-4 sentences, but struggle to elaborate enough to reach "4-5" while maintaining good quality. Some might write a list-like paragraph rather than flowing sentences. They might also struggle with appropriate vocabulary to express "why" they enjoy it beyond a very simple statement.

*   **Competent (20% of students):** These students generally have a decent grasp of English grammar and vocabulary. They would understand the prompt fully and be able to construct a coherent paragraph of 4-5 sentences, addressing all parts (hobby, when, why). They might make a few minor grammatical errors, but the overall message would be clear and well-structured. Their vocabulary for "why" would be more varied.

*   **Advanced (10% of students):** These students would comfortably write a complete, grammatically correct paragraph of 4-5 sentences or more. Their vocabulary would be richer, and their sentences more complex and varied. They would easily articulate their hobby, when they do it, and express their enjoyment clearly and eloquently. They would likely exceed the basic requirements.

**Common Mistakes & Challenges:**

*   **Language Barriers:** Many students cannot read the prompt fluently, let alone understand all its nuances. I'd have to read it aloud and explain each part in Hindi first.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This task requires both. Recalling their hobby is easy, but formulating thoughts about "when" and "why" into English sentences requires reasoning and language production.
*   **Specificity:** The prompt is specific (4-5 sentences, clear hobby, when, why). This structure is challenging for lower-proficiency students who tend to write in short, disconnected phrases.
*   **Grammar:** Frequent errors include:
    *   Incorrect verb forms (e.g., "I like *play* cricket" instead of "I like *playing* cricket").
    *   Missing articles (a, an, the).
    *   Incorrect prepositions (e.g., "I play *in* evening" instead of "I play *in the* evening").
    *   Subject-verb agreement issues (e.g., "My hobby *are* reading").
    *   Sentence fragments.
*   **Vocabulary for "Why":** Many struggle to express *why* they enjoy something beyond "It is good" or "I like it." They lack words like "relaxing," "fun," "creative," "learn new things," etc.
*   **Paragraph Structure:** Lower-level students often struggle to connect sentences to form a cohesive paragraph. They might list facts rather than build a narrative.
