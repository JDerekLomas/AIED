Alright, let's break this down from the perspective of teaching Class 6 Social Science in a government school in Rajasthan.

The question asks for two natural resources and an explanation of one's influence.

**Common Mistakes & Challenges:**

*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Natural resources" itself is a complex term for many Hindi-medium students. "Influences" and "lives of the people" also require careful comprehension. Many will struggle to *read* the question accurately, let alone formulate an answer in English. They might know the *names* of resources in Hindi but struggle with the English equivalents.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** Identifying two resources is recall. Explaining the influence requires a bit of reasoning and connecting cause-and-effect. For example, knowing "water" is one thing, but explaining how *lack of water* influences agriculture, lifestyle, and migration is a step further.
*   **Specificity:** The question is fairly specific. "Water" is good, but "Marble" or "Copper" are also excellent. The explanation needs to be relevant to Rajasthan.
*   **Vocabulary:** Even if they understand the concept, expressing it in simple English sentences can be tough. They might use very basic, fragmented sentences.
*   **Misconceptions:** Some might confuse natural resources with man-made things or general features of Rajasthan (like deserts).

Let's estimate the scores:

*   **Struggling (35% of students):** These students often have very limited English vocabulary and struggle with basic reading comprehension. They might pick up a few words like "Rajasthan" and "resources" but won't grasp the full question. Even if they know "paani" (water) or "ret" (sand) in Hindi, writing it in English and then explaining its influence is beyond them. They might write one word, or nothing at all, or something completely irrelevant.
    *   **struggling: 0% full marks** (They might get 0.5 for one resource if I'm very lenient, but full marks for two resources *and* an explanation in English is highly unlikely).

*   **Basic (35% of students):** These students can read some English but struggle with complex sentences. They might identify one or two resources (like water, sand, or marble) if they've been taught specifically. The explanation part will be very challenging. They might write a very short, fragmented sentence, or just state a fact without explaining the *influence*. For example, "Water. People drink water." This doesn't explain its *influence* on their lives in the context of Rajasthan's scarcity.
    *   **basic: 5% full marks** (A very small fraction might manage to recall two resources and give a minimal, but acceptable, explanation for one, perhaps with significant grammatical errors. They are more likely to get partial marks for just naming resources.)

*   **Competent (20% of students):** These students have a decent grasp of English for their age and can comprehend most of the question. They would likely identify two resources (e.g., Water and Marble/Copper/Salt). They would also be able to formulate a simple explanation for one, connecting it to the lives of people in Rajasthan (e.g., "Water is very less in Rajasthan, so people have to save water and it affects farming." or "Marble is found here, so many people work in marble mines and factories."). Their English might still have errors, but the meaning would be clear.
    *   **competent: 60% full marks** (The majority would score full marks, demonstrating both recall and basic reasoning in English.)

*   **Advanced (10% of students):** These students are comfortable with English reading and writing for their grade level. They would easily identify two appropriate resources and provide a clear, concise explanation of the influence of one, with good sentence structure and vocabulary. They might even provide a more nuanced explanation.
    *   **advanced: 95% full marks** (A rare slip-up might occur, but generally, they would handle this question well.)
