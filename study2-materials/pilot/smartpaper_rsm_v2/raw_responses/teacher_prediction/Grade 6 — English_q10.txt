This is a classic "some/any" distinction that often trips up students, especially those from Hindi-medium backgrounds where a direct translation might not exist or be clear.

Here's my breakdown for a Class 6 English class in a government school, given the demographics:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** These students would likely struggle with reading the sentence itself, let alone understanding the nuance of 'some' vs. 'any'. They might guess randomly, or if they've heard 'some' used in a similar context before, they might pick it purely by rote without understanding the rule. The concept of 'some' for positive statements and 'any' for negative/questions is often too abstract for them at this stage.

**basic:** 30% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** These students might recognize the words 'apples' and 'basket'. They might have encountered 'some' in simple positive sentences before, perhaps in an earlier grade or a previous lesson. They might not fully grasp the *rule* but have a stronger intuition or recall from seeing similar sentence structures. However, the distinction with 'any' can still be confusing, and they might easily pick 'any' if they've seen it in a question or negative sentence recently.

**competent:** 70% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** These students are more likely to have been explicitly taught the 'some/any' rule for positive statements, negative statements, and questions. They would recall that 'some' is used in affirmative sentences like this one. While they might still make occasional errors in more complex scenarios, this straightforward example should be within their grasp.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** These students would almost certainly know and apply the 'some/any' rule correctly. They would recognize the affirmative structure of the sentence immediately and choose 'some'. Their understanding of basic grammar rules is solid.
