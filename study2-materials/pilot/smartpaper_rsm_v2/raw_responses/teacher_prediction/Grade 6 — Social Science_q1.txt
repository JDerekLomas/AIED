This is a very common type of question we see, and I've learned to anticipate where the struggles will be.

Here's my breakdown:

*   **struggling:** 5% full marks
    *   **Why so low?** The biggest barrier here is often the English. "Major mountain ranges" might be too complex for them to fully grasp, even if they know the Hindi terms. Even if they recognize "mountain," "ranges" can be tricky. Many will simply draw a blank because they can't decode the question, not because they don't know the content. Some might only remember one name, or misspell it so badly it's unrecognizable.
*   **basic:** 30% full marks
    *   **Why this percentage?** These students would likely recognize "mountain" and "India." They've probably heard "Himalayas" many times, and perhaps one or two other major ones like "Aravalli" or "Vindhya." The challenge for them will be recalling *two* correct names and spelling them acceptably in English. They might get one correct but struggle with the second, or remember the Hindi name but not the English transliteration.
*   **competent:** 75% full marks
    *   **Why this percentage?** These students generally have a better grasp of English vocabulary and content. They will likely recall the Himalayas easily. For the second, they'd probably go for Aravalli, Vindhya, or Satpura, which are frequently discussed. Spelling might still be an issue for some, but they'd likely get at least one, and usually two, recognizable names.
*   **advanced:** 95% full marks
    *   **Why this percentage?** These students would have no problem with the English. They'd recall the major ranges quickly and accurately, often providing 3-4 options if asked. Spelling would not be a significant issue for them. The only reason it's not 100% is the remote chance of a silly mistake or momentary blank, but it's very rare for this type of recall question.
