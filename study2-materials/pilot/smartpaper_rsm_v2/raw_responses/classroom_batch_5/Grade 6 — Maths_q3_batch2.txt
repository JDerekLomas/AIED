Here's how 5 Class 6 students from an Indian government school might answer the math question, considering their backgrounds and ability levels:

---

**Subject: Mathematics**
**Question: Arrange in ascending order: `3367, 5492, 736, 4799`**

---

**Student 1 (basic):**

Answer:
736, 3367, 4799, 5492
*Self-correction/thought process: "Ascending... means small to big. OK, 736 is smallest. Then 3367. Then 4799. Last 5492. Yes, this is right."*

---

**Student 2 (competent):**

Answer:
Ascending order:
736, 3367, 4799, 5492
*Self-correction/thought process: "Ascending. Smallest to largest. Look at the number of digits first. 736 has 3 digits, so it's the smallest. The others have 4 digits. Compare the first digit: 3, 5, 4. So 3367, then 4799, then 5492. Perfect."*

---

**Student 3 (struggling):**

Answer:
3367, 5492, 736, 4799
*Self-correction/thought process: "Ascending... what is this? I don't know. Maybe just write them as they are? Or try to write something. I will just copy."*
(Might have copied the numbers as they appeared in the question, or just written them in a random order, not understanding 'ascending'.)

---

**Student 4 (basic):**

Answer:
736, 3367, 4799, 5492
*Self-correction/thought process: "Ascending... Chhota se bada. (Small to big). 736 is sabse chhota (smallest). Then 3367, then 4799. Then 5492. Yes, this looks right."*

---

**Student 5 (struggling):**

Answer:
Blank
*Self-correction/thought process: "Ascending order? What does it mean? I don't understand the English word. My teacher said it in Hindi last time, but I forgot. I don't know what to write. Better to leave it blank than write wrong."*
