Here's a simulation of five Class 8 students from an Indian government school, mostly Hindi-medium, attempting the Science question:

**Question:** A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit. Does gardener notice any change after some days? Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health.

**Student 1 (Basic)**

Haan, gardener ko badlav dikhega.
Kyunki ye cheeze sad jayengi.
Ye mitti ke liye acha hai, isse mitti healthy hogi.
Isse khaad banta hai.

---

**Student 2 (Basic)**

Yes, gardner will see change.
Becoz plant waste, vegetable and fruit waste will decompose.
Small small living thing will eat it.
This is good for soil health. It make soil strong and get more food for plants.

**Student 3 (Struggling)**

Gardner ko change dikhega.
Waste sadega.
Pata nahi kyun.
Mitti ko fayda hoga.

---

**Student 4 (Struggling)**

Yes, change will come.
Vegetable, fruit, plant waste become small small.
It is good for soil.
More plants grow.

---

**Student 5 (Competent)**

Yes, the gardener will observe a significant change after some days. The collected plant, vegetable, and fruit waste will start to decompose.

This decomposition happens due to the action of microorganisms like bacteria and fungi, which break down the complex organic matter into simpler substances. The waste will reduce in volume, change color, and develop an earthy smell.

This process is highly beneficial for soil health. The decomposed material forms **compost** or **humus**, which enriches the soil by:
1.  **Increasing nutrient content:** It releases essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium back into the soil, which are vital for plant growth.
2.  **Improving soil structure:** Humus makes the soil more porous, improving its aeration and water-holding capacity.
3.  **Enhancing microbial activity:** It provides a food source for beneficial soil microorganisms, further contributing to soil fertility.
4.  **Reducing need for chemical fertilizers:** Using compost reduces the reliance on synthetic chemical fertilizers, which can be harmful to the environment in the long run.

Therefore, this practice is excellent for maintaining and improving long-term soil health and fertility.
