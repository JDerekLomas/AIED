Here's how 5 Class 7 students from an Indian government school might answer that math question, considering their backgrounds and ability levels:

---

**Subject: Mathematics**
**Question: Find the area of a triangle whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm.**

---

**Student 1 (struggling):**
*Answer:*
Triangle.
Base 8 cm
Height 6 cm
Area = ?
(Leaves it at that, possibly drawing a small, rough triangle)

---

**Student 2 (struggling):**
*Answer:*
Area = base × height
= 8 × 6
= 48

---

**Student 3 (competent):**
*Answer:*
Given,
Base of triangle (b) = 8 cm
Height of triangle (h) = 6 cm

Formula for area of triangle = 1/2 × base × height
Area = 1/2 × 8 cm × 6 cm
Area = 1/2 × 48 cm²
Area = 24 cm²

---

**Student 4 (basic):**
*Answer:*
Base = 8 cm
Height = 6 cm
Area of triangle = 1/2 x base x height
= 1/2 x 8 x 6
= 1/2 x 48
= 24 cm

---

**Student 5 (basic):**
*Answer:*
Traingle Area = Half * Base * Height
= 1/2 * 8 * 6
= 1/2 * 48
= 24
