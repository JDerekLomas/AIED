The main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan are agriculture (farming), animal husbandry, and handicrafts. Some people also work as labourers or in small shops.

**Agriculture:** In Rajasthan's villages, farming is a very important occupation. People cultivate crops like bajra, wheat, jowar, and pulses. Due to less rainfall, they often depend on monsoon or borewells for irrigation. Farmers work hard in their fields to grow food for themselves and to sell in the market.
