Here's how 5 Class 7 students in an Indian government school might answer that math question, keeping their background and ability levels in mind:

---

**Subject: Mathematics**
**Question: Find the area of a triangle whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm.**

---

**Student 1 (basic):**

Area of triangle = 1/2 * base * height
= 1/2 * 8 cm * 6 cm
= 1/2 * 48 cm sq.
= 24 cm sq.

---

**Student 2 (struggling):**

area of tringle = base X height
= 8 X 6
= 48

(Might forget units or the 1/2 part entirely, or just write the formula partially)

---

**Student 3 (basic):**

Triagle area = 1/2 x b x h
= 1/2 x 8 x 6
= 4 x 6
= 24 sq cm.

---

**Student 4 (competent):**

Given:
Base of triangle (b) = 8 cm
Height of triangle (h) = 6 cm

Formula for area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height
Area = (1/2) * b * h
Area = (1/2) * 8 cm * 6 cm
Area = (1/2) * 48 cm²
Area = 24 cm²

Therefore, the area of the triangle is 24 square centimeters.

**Student 5 (struggling):**

(This student might just leave it blank, or attempt something very minimal and incorrect)

Area = B + H
= 8 + 6
= 14

(Or they might write something like "nahi pata" (don't know) in Hindi or simply leave it blank.)
