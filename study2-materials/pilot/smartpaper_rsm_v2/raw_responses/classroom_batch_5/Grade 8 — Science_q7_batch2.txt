**Student 3 (competent):**

Yes, the gardener will notice a significant change after some days. The collected waste of plants, vegetables, and fruits will start to decompose.

**Reasons:**
1. **Decomposition:** Microorganisms like bacteria and fungi, which are present in the soil and air, will break down the complex organic matter into simpler substances.
2. **Smell and Appearance:** The waste will start to smell foul, become dark in colour, and its volume will reduce as it breaks down.

**Beneficial for soil health:**
Yes, this process is highly beneficial for soil health.
1. **Nutrient Enrichment:** The decomposed matter, called compost or humus, returns essential nutrients (like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) back to the soil, making it more fertile.
2. **Improved Soil Structure:** Humus improves the soil's ability to retain water and air, making it loamy and better for plant roots to grow.
3. **Reduced Chemical Fertilizers:** Using compost reduces the need for artificial chemical fertilizers, which can be harmful to the environment in the long run.

This process is known as composting and it helps create nutrient-rich soil.
