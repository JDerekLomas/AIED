Here are the simulated answers from the 5 Class 8 students:

**Student 1 (basic):**

Harappan city very good. House straight line. Road cut each other. Drainage also there.

**Student 2 (competent):**

One key feature of Harappan Civilization's urban planning was its well-organized grid system. Cities like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were divided into two main parts: the Citadel and the Lower Town. Roads were laid out in a grid pattern, cutting each other at right angles. Houses were built along these roads, often with a private well and bathroom connected to an elaborate drainage system.
