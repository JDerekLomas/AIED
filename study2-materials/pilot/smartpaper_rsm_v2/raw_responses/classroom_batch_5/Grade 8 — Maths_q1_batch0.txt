Here are the simulated answers from the 5 Class 8 students in an Indian government school, keeping in mind their English proficiency and ability levels:

**Student 1 (competent):**

y + 9 = 4
y = 4 - 9
y = -5

**Student 2 (basic):**

y + 9 = 4
y = 4 - 9
y = minus 5

**Student 3 (struggling):**

y + 9 = 4
y = 4 + 9
y = 13

**Student 4 (basic):**

y + 9 = 4
y = 9 - 4
y = 5

**Student 5 (struggling):**

y + 9 = 4
y = blank
