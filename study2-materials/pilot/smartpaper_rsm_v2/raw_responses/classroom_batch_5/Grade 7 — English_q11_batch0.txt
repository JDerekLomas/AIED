Here's how 5 Class 7 students from an Indian government school might answer the English question, reflecting their varying abilities and Hindi-medium background:

**Question:** Identify the adjective phrase in the sentence:
A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony.

---

**Student 1 (competent):**

> "A tiny bird" is the adjective phrase.

*(S1 correctly identifies "A tiny bird" as the noun phrase where "tiny" is an adjective, but misses that the question asks for an adjective *phrase* that modifies a noun. Given the age and context, this is a strong answer demonstrating understanding of adjectives but not the subtle distinction of a "phrase" in its grammatical sense yet. They might be thinking of it as "the part of the sentence that tells us more about the bird").*

---

**Student 2 (struggling):**

> balcony

*(S2 picks out a familiar word from the sentence. They might be guessing, or thinking it's the "describing word" because it's a prominent noun, or simply writing down something to avoid leaving it blank.)*

---

**Student 3 (basic):**

> in our balcony

*(S3 correctly identifies the prepositional phrase. While it's an adverbial phrase here (modifying "built"), in other contexts, a prepositional phrase *can* function as an adjective phrase. Given the level, this shows a partial understanding of phrases and where they might occur, even if the function is misidentified. This student might be trying to find a group of words that describes *where* something is, which can sometimes be an adjective function.)*

---

**Student 4 (basic):**

> tiny bird

*(S4 is similar to S1 in identifying the descriptive part of the sentence, focusing on the adjective and the noun it modifies. They likely don't grasp "phrase" as a grammatical term for a group of words with a specific function, but rather as "the words that describe the bird.")*

---

**Student 5 (struggling):**

> bird nest

*(S5 likely picks out two consecutive, familiar words from the sentence. This is a common strategy for struggling students – find words they recognize and put them together, possibly without understanding the grammatical function. They might be associating "bird" and "nest" as being related or descriptive in some way.)*
