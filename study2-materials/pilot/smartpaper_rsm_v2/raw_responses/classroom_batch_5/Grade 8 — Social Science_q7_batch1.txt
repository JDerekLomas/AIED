The Battle of Plassey in 1757 was very important for British power in India. After this battle, the British East India Company, led by Robert Clive, defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal. This victory gave the British control over Bengal, which was a very rich province. They got a lot of revenue and resources from Bengal. This money helped them to raise and maintain a bigger army. It also weakened other Indian rulers and made the British the main power in the region. This was the start of British colonial rule in India.
