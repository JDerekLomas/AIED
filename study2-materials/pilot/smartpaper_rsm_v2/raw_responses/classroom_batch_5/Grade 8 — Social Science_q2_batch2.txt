Here's a simulation of 5 Class 8 students in an Indian government school, from Hindi-medium backgrounds, answering a Social Science question:

**Subject: Social Science**
**Question: Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning.**

---

**Student 1 (basic):**

Harappan city very good plan. Roads straight and cut each other right angle. Houses made of brick.

---

**Student 2 (basic):**

One key feature is the grid pattern. The streets were straight and cross at 90 degree. Drain system also there.

**Student 3 (struggling):**

Harappan city plan... umm... good. Houses are built. There is water.

---

**Student 4 (struggling):**

Harappan civilization urban... They make houses. It is old.

---

**Student 5 (competent):**

A key feature of Harappan urban planning was the well-organized grid pattern of their cities. Streets were laid out in a straight line, intersecting each other at precise right angles, dividing the city into rectangular blocks. This systematic layout is evident in major cities like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa.
