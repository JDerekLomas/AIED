Here's how 5 Class 8 students in an Indian government school might answer that Science question, keeping in mind their English proficiency, ability levels, and typical exam habits:

---

**Question:** A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit. Does gardener notice any change after some days? Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health.

---

**Student 1 (basic):**

Yes, gardener notice change.
The waste become small small and dark.
It is good for soil. Because it make soil strong for plants.
Plants grow good.

---

**Student 2 (struggling):**

Yes, change see.
Waste change.
It good.

---

**Student 3 (basic):**

Haan, gardener sees change.
The waste rot. It makes manure.
This is beneficial for soil health. Because it give food to soil and plants.
Soil become fertile.

---

**Student 4 (competent):**

Yes, the gardener will definitely notice a significant change after some days.
The plant, vegetable, and fruit waste will start to decompose. They will become softer, darker in colour, and their original shape will be lost. There might also be a foul smell initially, but later it will turn into an earthy smell. This process is called decomposition, carried out by microorganisms like bacteria and fungi.

This is highly beneficial for soil health.
1.  **Nutrient enrichment:** The decomposed waste turns into 'compost' or 'manure', which is rich in essential nutrients (like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) that plants need to grow.
2.  **Improves soil structure:** It makes the soil loose and airy, allowing roots to penetrate easily and water to drain well.
3.  **Increases water retention:** Compost helps the soil hold more water, reducing the need for frequent irrigation.
4.  **Promotes beneficial microbes:** It creates a healthy environment for beneficial soil organisms.
5.  **Reduces chemical fertilizer use:** By providing natural nutrients, it reduces the need for artificial chemical fertilizers, which can harm the environment in the long run.

**Student 5 (struggling):**

Yes, change.
Waste gone.
Good for mati.
