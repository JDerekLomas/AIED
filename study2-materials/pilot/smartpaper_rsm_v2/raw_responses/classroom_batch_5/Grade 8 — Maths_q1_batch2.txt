Here are the simulated answers from the 5 Class 8 students:

---

**Student 1 (basic):**

y + 9 = 4
y = 4 - 9
y = -5
Ans: -5

---

**Student 2 (competent):**

Equation is: y + 9 = 4
To find the value of y, we need to isolate y.
Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:
y + 9 - 9 = 4 - 9
y = -5
Therefore, the value of y is -5.

**Student 3 (struggling):**

y + 9 = 4
y = 9 - 4
y = 5
Ans: 5

---

**Student 4 (basic):**

y + 9 = 4
y = 4 - 9
y = minus 5
Answer: minus 5

**Student 5 (struggling):**

(This student leaves the answer blank or writes something completely nonsensical, as they struggle even with basic concepts and might not understand the English terms.)

*Possible answer 1 (blank):* (The space for the answer is empty.)

*Possible answer 2 (nonsensical attempt):*
y + 9 = 4
y = 4
(This shows a complete misunderstanding of how to manipulate the equation.)
