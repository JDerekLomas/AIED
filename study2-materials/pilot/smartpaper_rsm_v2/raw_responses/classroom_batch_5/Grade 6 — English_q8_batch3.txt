Here's how 5 Class 6 students from an Indian government school, with varying English abilities and Hindi-medium backgrounds, might answer the given question:

**Question: Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence:**
**book/reading/a/is/he**

---

**Student 1 (basic):**
He is reading book.

*(Shows understanding of the core subject-verb-object structure, but misses the article "a" or places it incorrectly, a common error for basic learners.)*

---

**Student 2 (basic):**
He is a reading book.

*(Attempts to include "a" but places it before "reading" instead of "book," another common error indicating an evolving understanding of articles.)*

---

**Student 3 (competent):**
He is reading a book.

*(Correctly identifies the subject, verb, and object, and places the article "a" in the correct position. This student has a solid grasp of basic sentence structure.)*

---

**Student 4 (struggling):**
Reading book he is.

*(Struggles with word order, often placing the verb or object early in the sentence due to influence from Hindi sentence structure or simply a lack of familiarity with English sentence patterns. Might have tried to put the most "important" words first.)*

---

**Student 5 (struggling):**
He book reading is.

*(Shows very poor understanding of English verb placement and auxiliary verbs. Likely tries to put the words together based on a very literal translation or a wild guess, reflecting significant difficulty with English grammar.)*
