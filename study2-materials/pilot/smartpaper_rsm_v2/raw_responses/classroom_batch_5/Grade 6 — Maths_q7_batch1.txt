Here are the simulated answers from the 5 Class 6 students:

---

**Student 1 (competent):**

*Initial temperature at 10 am = 30°C*
*Time from 10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours*
*(10-11, 11-12, 12-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 = 6 hours)*
*Temperature increase per hour = 2°C*
*Total increase in temperature = 6 hours * 2°C/hour = 12°C*
*Temperature at 4 pm = Initial temperature + Total increase*
*Temperature at 4 pm = 30°C + 12°C = 42°C*

*Answer: The temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening will be 42°C.*

**Student 2 (basic):**

*Temp at 10 am = 30 degree C*
*Increase temp every hour = 2 degree C*
*Time between 10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours (10-11, 11-12, 12-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4)*
*Total increase = 6 * 2 = 12 degree C*
*Temp at 4 pm = 30 + 12 = 42 degree C*

*Ans: 42 degree C*

**Student 3 (struggling):**

*Temp 10 baje = 30*
*Har ghante badhta hai = 2*
*4 baje sham ko kitna hoga?*
*10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4. 7 ghante?*
*7 * 2 = 14*
*30 + 14 = 44*

*44 C*

---

**Student 4 (basic):**

*Jodhpur temp 10 am = 30 C*
*Increase = 2 C per hour*
*Time from 10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours*
*Total increase = 6 x 2 = 12 C*
*Final temp = 30 + 12 = 42 C*

*Answer is 42 C*

**Student 5 (struggling):**

*30 C*
*2 C*
*4 baje*
*10 to 4 = 6 hours*
*6 * 2 = 12*
*30 + 12 = 42*

*42*
