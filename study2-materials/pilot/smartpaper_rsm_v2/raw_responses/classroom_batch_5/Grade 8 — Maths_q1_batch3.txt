Here are the simulated answers from the 5 Class 8 students, keeping their background and ability levels in mind:

**Student 1 (basic):**

Y + 9 = 4
Y = 4 - 9
Y = -5
(This student shows a basic understanding of transposing numbers, but might not elaborate further or show every single step.)

**Student 2 (competent):**

y + 9 = 4
y = 4 - 9
y = -5
(This student demonstrates a clear and correct understanding, writing neatly and directly to the point. They are competent in the subject.)

**Student 3 (struggling):**

y + 9 = 4
y = 9 - 4
y = 5
(This student struggles with the concept of negative numbers when transposing. They understand transposition but make a fundamental error in calculation or sign.)

**Student 4 (struggling):**

Y + 9 = 4
Y = 4 + 9
Y = 13
(This student struggles significantly. They have a basic idea of moving numbers but incorrectly apply the operation, adding instead of subtracting. They might be guessing or confused.)

**Student 5 (basic):**

y + 9 = 4
y = 4 - 9
y = -5
(Similar to Student 1, this student gets the correct answer with basic steps. They might not show extensive working out but arrive at the right solution.)
