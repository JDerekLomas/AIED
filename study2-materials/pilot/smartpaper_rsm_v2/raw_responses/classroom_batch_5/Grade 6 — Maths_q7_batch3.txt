Here are the simulated answers from the five Class 6 students:

---

**Student 1 (basic):**

Time: 10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours
Temperature increase = 2 degree C per hour
Total increase = 6 x 2 = 12 degree C
Starting temp = 30 degree C
Final temp = 30 + 12 = 42 degree C

Answer: 42 degree C

---

**Student 2 (struggling):**

10 am to 4 pm = 6 hour.
2 degree C per hour.
30 + 2 = 32.
6 x 2 = 12.
30 + 12.
42.

Answer: 42

**Student 3 (struggling):**

Time 10 to 4 = 6.
2 degree badh raha hai.
30 degree hai.
30+2 = 32.
32+2 = 34.
34+2 = 36.
36+2 = 38.
38+2 = 40.
40+2 = 42.

Answer: 42

**Student 4 (basic):**

From 10:00 am to 4:00 pm, there are 6 hours.
Temperature increases by 2 degrees Celsius every hour.
So, in 6 hours, temperature increases by 6 * 2 = 12 degrees Celsius.
Initial temperature was 30 degrees Celsius.
New temperature = 30 + 12 = 42 degrees Celsius.

Answer: The temperature will be 42 degrees C.

**Student 5 (competent):**

**Calculation:**

*   **Time duration:** From 10:00 am to 4:00 pm, the total time elapsed is 6 hours.
    (11 am, 12 pm, 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm = 6 hours)
*   **Temperature increase per hour:** 2°C
*   **Total temperature increase:** 6 hours * 2°C/hour = 12°C
*   **Initial temperature:** 30°C
*   **Final temperature:** Initial temperature + Total increase
    = 30°C + 12°C
    = 42°C

**Answer:** The temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening will be **42°C**.
