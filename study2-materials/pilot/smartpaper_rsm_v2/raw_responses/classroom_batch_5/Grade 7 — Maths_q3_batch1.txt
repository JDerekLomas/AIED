Here's how 5 Class 7 students from an Indian government school, with varying abilities and Hindi-medium backgrounds, might answer the given Mathematics question:

---

**Subject: Mathematics**
**Question: Find the area of a triangle whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm.**

---

**Student 1 (struggling):**

Area of triangle =
8 x 6 = 48

---

**Student 2 (struggling):**

Area =
base * height
8 * 6 = 48

---

**Student 3 (basic):**

Given:
Base of triangle = 8 cm
Height of triangle = 6 cm

Formula for area of triangle = 1/2 * base * height

Area = 1/2 * 8 cm * 6 cm
Area = 1/2 * 48 cm sq
Area = 24 cm sq

**Student 4 (competent):**

**Question: Find the area of a triangle whose base is 8 cm and height is 6 cm.**

**Solution:**

Given:
Base of the triangle (b) = 8 cm
Height of the triangle (h) = 6 cm

The formula for the area of a triangle is:
Area (A) = 1/2 × base × height
A = 1/2 × b × h

Substitute the given values into the formula:
A = 1/2 × 8 cm × 6 cm
A = 1/2 × 48 cm²
A = 24 cm²

**Answer:** The area of the triangle is 24 cm².

---

**Student 5 (basic):**

base = 8 cm
height = 6 cm

Area of triangle = 1/2 * base * height
= 1/2 * 8 * 6
= 1/2 * 48
= 24 cm sq
