Here's how the 5 Class 6 students might answer the English rearrangement question, keeping their described ability levels and common Hindi-medium errors in mind:

---

**Question:** Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence:
book/reading/a/is/he

---

**Student 1 (basic):**
He is reading a book.

*(Shows understanding of basic sentence structure, possibly with minor hesitation or self-correction in their head.)*

---

**Student 2 (struggling):**
He reading book.

*(Struggles with auxiliary verbs and articles. Understands the main subject and action but misses the grammatical connectors. Might have written a/is first, then crossed it out.)*

---

**Student 3 (competent):**
He is reading a book.

*(Correct and confident answer. Understands English sentence structure well for their age and context.)*

---

**Student 4 (basic):**
He is reading a book.

*(Similar to Student 1, a correct answer, but perhaps took a bit longer to formulate or had to read the words multiple times.)*

---

**Student 5 (struggling):**
Book he reading.

*(Shows a strong influence of Hindi sentence structure (object-subject-verb) or a very confused understanding of English word order. Might have simply picked words in an order that felt somewhat logical, but grammatically incorrect in English. Could also leave it blank if completely overwhelmed, but for this specific prompt, a jumbled attempt is likely.)*
