Here are the simulated answers from the 5 Class 7 students:

---

**Student 1 (basic):**

Area of triangle = 1/2 * base * height
= 1/2 * 8 * 6
= 1/2 * 48
= 24 sq cm.

---

**Student 2 (struggling):**

Area of triangle = base + height
= 8 + 6
= 14

---

**Student 3 (struggling):**

(Answer left blank)

---

**Student 4 (competent):**

Given:
Base (b) = 8 cm
Height (h) = 6 cm

Formula for Area of a triangle = 1/2 × base × height
Area = 1/2 × 8 cm × 6 cm
Area = 1/2 × 48 cm²
Area = 24 cm²

Therefore, the area of the triangle is 24 square centimeters.

**Student 5 (basic):**

Area of triangle = 1/2 * b * h
= 1/2 * 8 * 6
= 4 * 6
= 24 cm.
