**Student 1 (competent):**

Harappan civilization had very good urban planning. One key feature was their well-organized grid pattern. Cities like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were divided into two main parts: the Citadel and the Lower Town. The streets were straight and cut each other at right angles, making a grid. Houses were built along these streets. This shows they had good engineers and planners.
