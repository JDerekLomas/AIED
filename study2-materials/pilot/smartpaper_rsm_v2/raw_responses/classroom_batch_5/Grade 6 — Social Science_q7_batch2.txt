Here's how the 5 Class 6 students might answer the Social Science question, reflecting their ability levels and Hindi-medium background:

---

**Question:** Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.

---

**Student 1 (basic):**

Rajasthan main pani aur mitti milta hai.
Pani bahut jaruri hai Rajasthan ke logon ke liye. Udhar kam barish hota hai. Log pani bachate hai aur kheto mein bhi kam pani wala fasal ugathe hai. Jaise bajra. Pani se hi jivan hai.

---

**Student 2 (basic):**

Two natural resources in Rajasthan are:
1. Sand (ret)
2. Water (pani)

Water is very important for people. In Rajasthan, water is less. So people save water. They make 'tanka' to store rain water. They use less water for bathing and cleaning. Also, farmers grow crops that need less water like bajra and jowar. Life is hard without water.

**Student 3 (struggling):**

Rajasthan me resourse hai.
Pani
Aur ret.

Pani. Log pani ko use karte hai. Pani se kapde dhote hai. Aur kheto me pani dete hai. Pani bhot jaruri.

**Student 4 (struggling):**

Rajasthan resources:
1. Pani
2. Stone

Pani. People need pani. For drinking. For animals. For plants. No pani no life.

**Student 5 (competent):**

Two natural resources found in Rajasthan are:
1. Water
2. Minerals (like Marble, Gypsum, Salt)

Water significantly influences the lives of people in Rajasthan. As Rajasthan is a desert state, rainfall is very scarce. Due to this, water becomes a precious resource.
People have developed various traditional methods to conserve water, such as building 'tankas' (underground tanks) and 'bawris' (stepwells) to collect rainwater. Their agricultural practices are also adapted to water scarcity, with farmers preferring drought-resistant crops like bajra, jowar, and gram. Water also dictates the location of settlements, with villages often developing near water sources. The daily routines and economic activities of the people are deeply shaped by the availability, or lack thereof, of water.
