नमस्ते बच्चों! आज हम राजस्थान के बारे में सीखेंगे, हमारे प्यारे राज्य के बारे में!

(I would start by speaking in Hindi and then gradually transition to a mix of Hindi and simple English, using visuals and real-life examples to explain.)

**प्रश्न:** राजस्थान में पाए जाने वाले किन्हीं दो प्राकृतिक संसाधनों का नाम बताओ और उनमें से एक लोगों के जीवन को कैसे प्रभावित करता है, यह समझाओ।

(I would project this question on a blackboard or a chart paper, written in both English and simple Hindi.)

**Scoring rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy).
Max score: 1

Here's my assessment of how my students would perform:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they know the resources, articulating them in English is very difficult. Many might struggle to even read and understand the question fully.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall one or two resources if we've discussed them extensively and linked them to local examples (e.g., "पाणी" (water), "नमक" (salt)). Explaining the influence requires a bit more reasoning and sentence construction, which is a major challenge for them in English.
*   **Specificity:** They might say "stones" instead of "marble" or "sandstone."
*   **Common Mistakes:** Misunderstanding the question, providing only one resource, answering in Hindi when English is expected (even if simple), inability to form coherent sentences for the explanation part.

**basic:** 30% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** They can grasp the meaning of the question with some effort or a quick Hindi translation. They might know common resource names.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can usually recall two resources, especially if they are prominent in the region (like water, salt, or marble). Explaining the influence might be a struggle, leading to fragmented or very short answers, or they might struggle with the correct English vocabulary.
*   **Specificity:** They might get the names of resources correct (e.g., "water," "salt").
*   **Common Mistakes:** Giving only names and struggling with the explanation, using very simple and grammatically incorrect English for the explanation, not connecting the resource to *how* it influences lives clearly.

**competent:** 70% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** They can read and understand the question with reasonable ease.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can easily recall two natural resources. They can attempt to explain the influence, perhaps with some grammatical errors, but the core idea will be there. They might choose an easier resource like 'water' or 'sunlight' to explain its influence.
*   **Specificity:** They will likely get the names of resources correct and specific.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Minor grammatical errors in the explanation, not elaborating enough on the influence, or perhaps only explaining one resource briefly.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue understanding the question.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will recall two correct natural resources and provide a clear, concise explanation of how one influences people's lives, with good vocabulary and sentence structure.
*   **Specificity:** They will provide accurate and specific names of resources.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very rare; perhaps a slight oversight in specificity or a minor grammatical slip, but overall, they would meet the criteria for full marks.
