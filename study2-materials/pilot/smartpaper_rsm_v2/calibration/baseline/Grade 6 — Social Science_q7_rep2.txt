**Thinking Process (as the teacher):**

Okay, Class 6 Social Science, Rajasthan natural resources. Let's break this down based on my students.

*   **The Question Itself:** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."
    *   **Part 1: Two Natural Resources.** This is pure recall. They've probably seen maps or lists. Common ones that come to mind for Rajasthan are 'pani' (water), 'mitti' (sand/soil), 'namak' (salt), 'patthar' (stone/marble), 'sooraj ki roshni' (sunlight). Some might remember 'taamba' (copper) or 'hawa' (wind).
    *   **Part 2: Explain Influence.** This requires a bit more than recall. They need to connect the resource to daily life. This is where the language barrier and reasoning ability will really come into play.
*   **Language Barrier:** This is HUGE. "Mention," "natural resources," "influences." These are not everyday Hindi words for them. Even if they know the *concept* in Hindi, articulating it in English will be tough. I'll likely get answers like "Rajasthan has water. Water is good for people." or "Marble. People build house." This might get them partial marks, but "full marks" needs a slightly better explanation.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:**
    *   Recall (two resources): Relatively easy if they've paid attention during class discussions or seen diagrams.
    *   Reasoning (influence): This is harder. It requires them to form a simple cause-and-effect statement.
*   **Specificity:** "Two correct natural resources" is fairly broad (many options). "Explain how one of them influences" is less specific, but still requires *some* explanation. "Water for drinking and farming" or "Marble for building houses" would be good enough.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Language:** Misunderstanding the question due to English terms. Giving answers in broken English or Hindi (if I allowed it, but the rubric implies English).
    *   **Not two:** Only listing one resource.
    *   **No explanation:** Just listing two resources without explaining influence.
    *   **Vague explanation:** "Water is important." (Not specific enough for "how it influences").
    *   **Irrelevant explanation:** "Marble is beautiful." (Not really *influencing* their daily lives in a functional way, though it is used for art/architecture).
    *   **Confusing natural with man-made:** Listing "forts" or "handicrafts."

**Applying to student groups:**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   Language: Very difficult. They might pick up one or two key words.
    *   Recall: Might remember *one* resource if it was heavily emphasized (like water or sand). Two would be a stretch.
    *   Reasoning: Almost impossible for them to articulate a proper influence in English. They might just list one word or a very fragmented sentence.
    *   *Conclusion:* Very few will get full marks. Some might get half marks for one correct resource, but the explanation will be too poor.
    *   *Estimate:* 0-5% (leaning towards 0-2%). I'll go with 2% as a generous estimate, assuming one or two might just randomly hit it due to rote learning.

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   Language: Can grasp some key terms, but struggle with sentence construction.
    *   Recall: Many will remember two resources (e.g., water, sand, marble).
    *   Reasoning: This is the tricky part. They might attempt an explanation, but it will likely be very basic and grammatically flawed. "Water for farm." or "Marble for house." This *might* be enough for full marks if the grader is lenient, but the rubric implies slightly more. They might forget to explain or explain poorly.
    *   *Conclusion:* A good chunk will get the two resources. Explaining the influence is the hurdle. Maybe half of this group.
    *   *Estimate:* 25-35%. I'll go with 30%.

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   Language: Generally understand the question. Can construct simple sentences.
    *   Recall: Will easily get two resources.
    *   Reasoning: They should be able to provide a clear, simple explanation for the influence. "Water is used for drinking and irrigation for farming" or "Marble is used for building houses and temples." This is within their capability.
