This is a classic 'some/any' distinction, which can be tricky for students with limited English exposure, especially those from Hindi-medium backgrounds where a direct translation might not clearly differentiate the usage in affirmative vs. interrogative/negative sentences.

Here's my breakdown based on the student profiles:

*   **struggling: 0% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** These students would likely not understand the question itself, let alone the nuance between 'some' and 'any'. They might guess randomly, but understanding the rule for affirmative sentences would be beyond them. Reading the words 'some' and 'any' correctly would also be a challenge for many.

*   **basic: 10% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** A very small percentage might get this right, primarily through rote memorization if this exact sentence structure was drilled, or if they've picked up the pattern through extensive exposure (which is less likely given their background). However, most would struggle to recall the specific rule for 'some' in affirmative sentences vs. 'any' in questions/negations. They might confuse it or guess.

*   **competent: 60% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** These students would have a foundational understanding of basic grammar. They would likely have been taught the 'some' for affirmative, 'any' for negative/interrogative rule, and could recall it. While some might still make a mistake due to a moment of confusion or lack of complete consolidation, the majority would apply the rule correctly.

*   **advanced: 95% full marks**
    *   **Reasoning:** Students in this category would have a solid grasp of basic grammar rules and often pick up nuances quickly. They would correctly identify that this is an affirmative sentence requiring 'some'. The error rate would be minimal, perhaps due to a rare lapse in attention rather than a lack of knowledge.
