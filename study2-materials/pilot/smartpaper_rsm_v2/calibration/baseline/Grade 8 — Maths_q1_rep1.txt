Here's my breakdown based on my experience:

**Thinking Process:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The equation `y + 9 = 4` itself uses universal mathematical symbols. The English phrasing "Find the value of y in the equation" is quite standard and would likely be understood, especially if I had introduced such instructions before. However, the *meaning* of solving an equation might still be hazy for some.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires recall of the "inverse operation" concept to isolate 'y' (subtracting 9 from both sides). It also requires recall of integer operations (4 - 9 = -5). While basic reasoning is involved, it's heavily reliant on remembering the procedural steps and arithmetic rules.
*   **Specific Answer:** The answer `-5` is very specific. No partial credit is mentioned, so any arithmetic error or sign error would result in 0 marks.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Arithmetic Error:** `9 - 4 = 5` instead of `4 - 9 = -5`. This is the *most common* mistake for struggling and basic students when negatives are involved. They often struggle with operations involving positive and negative integers, especially when the smaller number is subtracted from the larger one but has a negative sign implicitly involved.
    *   **Sign Error:** Simply writing `5` instead of `-5`.
    *   **"Moving" the wrong number/operation:** Some might try to do `y = 9 - 4` or even `y = 4 + 9`.
    *   **Confusion with fractions/multiplication:** Less likely here, but for very struggling students, any new operation can be confusing.
    *   **Ignoring 'y':** Some might just calculate `9 + 4` or `9 - 4` without understanding the objective of finding `y`.

**Percentage Breakdown:**

*   **struggling: 5% full marks**
    *   For most of these students, the concept of isolating 'y' and dealing with negative numbers will be a significant hurdle. They might get confused by the "equals" sign and simply perform an operation on the given numbers without understanding the goal. A very small percentage might accidentally get it right or have recently grasped the concept after focused individual attention.
*   **basic: 30% full marks**
    *   These students will generally understand the concept of "solving for y" and the idea of moving numbers to the other side. However, the negative integer arithmetic (`4 - 9 = -5`) is where many will falter. They might correctly move '9' and subtract, but make an error with the sign, resulting in '5' instead of '-5'. A good portion will get the procedure but struggle with the specific calculation involving negatives.
*   **competent: 80% full marks**
    *   Most competent students will understand the procedure and be comfortable with integer operations. They will correctly subtract 9 from both sides and arrive at -5. A small percentage might still make a careless sign error or an arithmetic slip, but the understanding of the underlying concept will be strong.
*   **advanced: 95% full marks**
    *   These students will find this question straightforward. They are comfortable with inverse operations and integer arithmetic. Any missed points would likely be due to extreme carelessness rather than a lack of understanding.
