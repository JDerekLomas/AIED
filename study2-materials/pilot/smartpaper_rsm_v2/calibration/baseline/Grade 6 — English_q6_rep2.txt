This is a classic question that looks simple on the surface but reveals a lot about our students' understanding and ability to express themselves. Given the context of my Class 6 English students in a government school, I've seen this play out many times.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** These students will struggle to even read and comprehend the poem, let alone pick a line and articulate a reason in English. They might just point to a random line or repeat one they've heard.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires reasoning and expression, which are far beyond their current capabilities in English. They might recall a line if it was repeated often, but explaining *why* they like it is impossible for them.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Pointing to a line without explanation, providing a one-word answer (e.g., "good"), or staying completely silent.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** A small percentage here might be able to read and understand *some* of the lines, especially if simpler vocabulary is used. They might pick a line that resonated with them emotionally or visually.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might be able to recall a line, but forming a coherent sentence to explain *why* is the biggest hurdle. Some might manage a very simple, albeit grammatically incorrect, reason (e.g., "I like this line because it is happy").
*   **Common Mistakes:** Picking a line but providing a very vague or incomplete reason, using Hindi to explain, or giving a reason that doesn't quite make sense in English. The 10% would be those who manage a rudimentary English reason.

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** These students can generally read and understand the poem. They will be able to identify lines and grasp their meaning.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall lines and are capable of forming a sentence or two to explain their preference. They might use slightly better vocabulary and sentence structure than the basic group. The reason might still be somewhat superficial but will be present and relevant.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Providing a reason that is a bit generic or lacking depth, or making minor grammatical errors. However, they will meet the rubric's core requirements.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here. They will understand the poem thoroughly.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will effortlessly pick a line and articulate a clear, concise, and often insightful reason. Their explanation will likely use appropriate vocabulary and good sentence structure. They might even try to justify their choice with a deeper understanding of the poem's themes or imagery.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Even advanced students can occasionally rush and provide a slightly less elaborate answer than they are capable of, or make a very minor grammatical slip. But they will definitely fulfill the rubric.
