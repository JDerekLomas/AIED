This is a great question that makes me think deeply about my students and their learning journey. Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** Many of these students would struggle to even read and comprehend the active voice sentence correctly. "Blew" and "away" might be new or confusing vocabulary.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This isn't just recall; it requires understanding the structure of active and passive voice, identifying the subject, verb, and object, and then applying the transformation rules (object becomes subject, use 'be' verb + past participle, 'by' phrase). This is a multi-step reasoning process that is far beyond their current grasp.
* **Common mistakes:** Even if they understood the words, they wouldn't know the grammatical rules. They might just try to reorder the words randomly or change one word.

**basic: 5% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** Some might be able to read and understand the core meaning, but words like "blew" might still be tricky.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might have been introduced to active/passive voice, but their understanding is likely superficial. They might recognize "by the wind" as a passive indicator but struggle with the correct verb form or the overall structure.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * "The leaves blown away by the wind." (Missing 'were')
    * "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Subject-verb agreement error)
    * "The leaves are blown away by the wind." (Tense change)
    * "The leaves the wind blew away." (No transformation)
    * They might get parts right but miss the perfect combination of tense, 'be' verb, and past participle. The past tense of "blow" ("blown") is often a challenge.

**competent: 50% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** They would generally understand the sentence and the vocabulary.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would have been taught active/passive voice and might have practiced it. They understand the concept of shifting emphasis.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * **Tense confusion:** "The leaves are blown away by the wind" (Present tense instead of past). This is a very common error even among competent learners who rush or don't pay close attention to the original tense.
    * **Verb form:** Occasionally, they might struggle with the past participle of irregular verbs like "blow" (blew/blown). They might write "blewed" or "blowed."
    * **Omitting "by the wind":** Some might simply write "The leaves were blown away," which is grammatically correct but might not be considered "full marks" if the rubric specifically asks for the "by" phrase.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** No issues here.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would have a strong grasp of grammar rules, including active and passive voice transformation. They would instantly recognize the required changes.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * Even advanced students can make a careless mistake with tense if they are rushing or are distracted. Perhaps 5-10% might momentarily slip into the present tense if they are not careful.
    * Very rarely, a spelling error if they are writing quickly.

This exercise really highlights the stratified learning levels in a government school classroom and the specific challenges each group faces.
