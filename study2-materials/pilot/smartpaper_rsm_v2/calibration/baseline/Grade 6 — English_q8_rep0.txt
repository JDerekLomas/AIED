This is a classic sentence rearrangement task, fundamental for understanding basic English sentence structure. Given the student demographics and proficiency levels, here's my breakdown:

*   **Struggling (35%):** Many students in this group would struggle significantly with even recognizing the words, let alone understanding their meaning or grammatical function. Their English vocabulary is very limited, and they often translate word-for-word from Hindi, which doesn't directly map to English syntax. They might pick out "book" and "he" but struggle with the verb and its conjugation, or the articles. The concept of subject-verb-object might be completely new or very shaky.
    *   **Common mistakes:** Random ordering, missing words, putting "a" at the end, not knowing "is" connects to "he", or "reading" connects to "book."
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks**

*   **Basic (35%):** These students might recognize most of the words and have a rudimentary understanding of some simple sentence structures. They've likely encountered "He is reading" or "He is a boy" before. They might try to construct the sentence but could still make errors with word order, especially with the article "a" or the placement of the verb "is." They would rely more on recall of common sentence patterns rather than deep grammatical reasoning.
    *   **Common mistakes:** "He reading a book is," "He a book is reading," or "Reading a book he is."
    *   **basic: 40% full marks**

*   **Competent (20%):** Students at this level generally grasp basic English sentence structure (SVO). They've probably practiced sentence rearrangements before and understand the concept of a subject, verb, and object. They would be able to identify "He" as the subject, "is reading" as the verb phrase, and "a book" as the object. They'd likely apply their understanding of basic grammar rules.
    *   **competent: 85% full marks**

*   **Advanced (10%):** These students would find this item very straightforward. They have a solid understanding of English grammar and vocabulary. They would immediately recognize the correct SVO structure and arrange the words accurately without hesitation.
    *   **advanced: 100% full marks**
