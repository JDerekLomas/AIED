Let's break down how my students would likely perform on this question, keeping all those factors in mind.

**Thinking Process for Each Group:**

*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle for my "struggling" and a significant one for "basic" students. "Temperature," "increases by," "per hour," "elapsed," "what will be" – all these English terms could cause confusion. I would definitely have to read and explain it in Hindi first, or many wouldn't even start.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question primarily requires reasoning, specifically understanding time intervals and then applying a simple multiplication and addition. There's no direct formula to recall, but the *method* of calculating elapsed time is something we'd practice.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The answer needs to be a specific numerical value (42) and a unit (°C). No partial credit for just the process if the final answer is wrong.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Time Calculation:**
        *   Miscalculating 10 am to 4 pm. Some might count 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 as 7 hours.
        *   Forgetting to count the 'jump' over 12 pm.
        *   Getting 4 hours instead of 6 hours.
    *   **Arithmetic:** Simple multiplication or addition errors.
    *   **Understanding "per hour":** Some might just add 2°C once, or multiply by 4 (thinking 4 pm means 4 hours).
    *   **Ignoring the initial temperature:** Some might just calculate 6 hours * 2°C = 12°C and forget to add it to 30°C.

**Percentage of Students Scoring Full Marks:**

Here's my realistic assessment:

*   **struggling: 0% full marks**
    *   Even with me explaining in Hindi, the multi-step nature (calculate time, multiply, then add) would be too much. They might get one step right (e.g., understand it's about temperature increasing), but putting it all together for a full score is highly improbable. The language barrier for reading it independently would completely block them.
*   **basic: 10% full marks**
    *   A small percentage, usually those who are on the higher end of "basic" and pick up concepts quickly after explanation.
    *   Most would struggle with either calculating the 6 hours correctly or making an arithmetic error in the final step. Some might forget to add the initial 30°C. Many would get the idea of adding 2°C for some duration, but the time calculation is a significant hurdle. If I guide them through the time calculation, maybe more, but for an independent solve, 10% is generous.
*   **competent: 60% full marks**
    *   These students generally understand the language once clarified and can follow multi-step problems. Their primary challenge might be a minor arithmetic slip or a slight miscalculation of time (e.g., 5 hours instead of 6). They grasp the "per hour" concept well. With proper encouragement and a second look, many of the initially incorrect ones could self-correct.
*   **advanced: 90% full marks**
    *   These students are usually proficient enough in English to understand the question independently or with minimal clarification. They are strong in time calculations and arithmetic. They would correctly identify the 6-hour interval, multiply by 2, and add to the initial temperature without much trouble. The 10% who might not get full marks would likely make a silly arithmetic error or misread a number, not a conceptual mistake.
