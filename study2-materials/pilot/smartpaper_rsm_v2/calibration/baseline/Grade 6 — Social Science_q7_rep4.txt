My dear students, this question is about our very own Rajasthan! We've talked so much about what makes our state special. Let's see how many of you remember the wonderful things nature has given us here.

Here's my prediction for how students would score:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they know the resources, understanding "natural resources," "influences," and "lives" in English is very difficult. They might struggle to even read the question properly.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might be able to recall one or two resources if we've drilled it, but explaining the *influence* requires a bit more reasoning and connecting ideas, which is tough with limited vocabulary.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might list things that aren't natural resources (e.g., temples, forts). If they do list resources, they'll struggle to explain the influence in English. They might just write "water is important."

**basic: 20% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They will likely understand "natural resources" and might grasp the core of "influences lives," but constructing a complete English sentence for the explanation will be a challenge. They might identify the resources but give a very short, fragmented explanation.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall 1-2 resources. Explaining the influence will be basic, perhaps just a simple statement like "Water helps farming."
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might correctly name two resources but only explain one very briefly, or their English explanation might be grammatically incorrect or incomplete. They might get one resource right and struggle with the second, or mix up natural and man-made.

**competent: 70% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They will mostly understand the question. They might make minor grammatical errors but will be able to convey the meaning.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can easily recall two resources. They can provide a decent explanation of how one resource influences lives, even if the vocabulary isn't sophisticated.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might choose a less obvious resource and struggle slightly with the explanation, or their explanation might be a bit too brief. Sometimes they might name three resources and only explain one well.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here. They will understand the question perfectly and be able to articulate their answer clearly and correctly in English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will effortlessly recall multiple natural resources and can provide a well-structured and detailed explanation of how one of them influences life, using appropriate vocabulary.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very rare. Perhaps a small spelling error, or choosing an explanation that is slightly less impactful than another option, but generally, they will score full marks.
