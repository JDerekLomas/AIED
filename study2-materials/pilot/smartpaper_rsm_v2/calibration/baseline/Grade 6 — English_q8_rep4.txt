This is a good question that really makes me think about my students!

Here's my breakdown for "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he":

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** I'd say very few. Many of them would struggle to even recognize all the words, let alone understand their meaning or grammatical function. They might try to put a few words together randomly or just write down the words as they appear. The concept of "meaningful sentence" is often lost on them in English.
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks**

*   **Basic (35% of class):** This group might recognize most words and even understand the individual meanings. They might understand the *idea* that someone is reading. However, forming a grammatically correct English sentence with the correct word order (Subject-Verb-Object) is still a significant hurdle. They might get "He reading a book is" or "Reading he is a book." They might even get "He is reading a book" if they've seen this exact sentence structure before and are recalling it, but not necessarily if they are applying SVO rules. The "is" often gets misplaced.
    *   **basic: 40% full marks**

*   **Competent (20% of class):** This group generally has a better grasp of basic sentence structure in English. They would likely understand the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) pattern and the use of the auxiliary verb "is" for present continuous. They've probably practiced such rearrangements before.
    *   **competent: 90% full marks**

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** For these students, this is a relatively straightforward task. They would instantly recognize the SVO structure and form the correct sentence without much difficulty.
    *   **advanced: 100% full marks**
