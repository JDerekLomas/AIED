Namaste bachho! (Hello children!)

This is a good question, and it combines a few things we've been learning. Let's think about how our students would do.

**struggling: 5% full marks**
For our struggling students, this question presents several hurdles.
*   **Language Barrier:** The English is quite dense for them. "Temperature increases by 2°C per hour" and "what will be the temperature" would be very difficult to understand completely. They might pick up "temperature" and "Jodhpur" and "2°C" but the crucial "per hour" and "increases" would likely be lost.
*   **Time Calculation:** Calculating time elapsed from 10 am to 4 pm is a significant challenge for them. Many struggle with telling time accurately, let alone calculating durations across AM/PM boundaries. They might just subtract 4 from 10 (getting 6, coincidentally, but for the wrong reason) or get confused and say 2 hours (10 to 12, then 2 to 4).
*   **Multi-step Problem:** This is a two-step problem (calculate time, then calculate temperature increase). They would likely get stuck at the first step even if they understood the language.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might just add 2 to 30 and say 32, misunderstanding the "per hour" part. Or they might get a very random answer.

**basic: 30% full marks**
Our basic level students would fare a bit better, but still face challenges.
*   **Language Barrier:** They would understand parts, but might struggle with "increases by 2°C per hour" fully. They might need a teacher or peer to explain it in Hindi. The core idea of "how much time passes" might be grasped.
*   **Time Calculation:** Calculating 10 am to 4 pm is something they *can* do, but often with some effort and maybe needing to count on their fingers or draw a clock. They might make a mistake and say 5 hours or 7 hours if they miscount. Some would correctly identify 6 hours.
*   **Reasoning:** If they get the time correct, the multiplication (6 hours * 2°C/hour = 12°C) is within their reach. Adding 30 + 12 = 42 is also something they can do.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Getting the time duration wrong would be the primary reason for not getting full marks. Some might multiply 30 by 2 or add 2 only once, showing a partial understanding of "per hour."

**competent: 75% full marks**
These students would likely grasp most of the concepts.
*   **Language Barrier:** They would understand the question almost completely. They might pause on "per hour" but would usually deduce its meaning.
*   **Time Calculation:** Calculating 10 am to 4 pm is a routine task for them. They would quickly identify 6 hours.
*   **Reasoning:** They would clearly understand the multi-step nature: find time, find total increase, add to initial temperature. They would confidently calculate 6 * 2 = 12 and 30 + 12 = 42.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Minor calculation errors are possible, or a momentary lapse in adding the initial temperature (just giving 12 as the answer). But getting the 6 hours would be very high.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
Our advanced students would find this question straightforward.
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue at all. They would read and comprehend instantly.
*   **Time Calculation:** They would calculate 6 hours almost immediately, probably mentally.
*   **Reasoning:** They would see the problem as a simple application of multiplication and addition, confidently arriving at 42°C. They might even do it all in their head.
*   **Common Mistakes:** A very rare, careless arithmetic error might occur, but it's highly unlikely they would miss the core logic or the time calculation.
