This is a common sentence structure we practice, but the challenges are significant. Here's my breakdown:

*   **Language barriers (many can't read English well):** This is the biggest hurdle for the struggling group. Even if they know the structure orally, deciphering the written words "reading" and "book" can be tough. They might recognize "he" and "is" more easily.
*   **Whether this requires recall vs. reasoning:** It's a blend. For the basic and struggling students, it's more recall of a practiced pattern. For competent and advanced, it's more reasoning about subject-verb-object order, even if they haven't seen *this exact* sentence.
*   **How specific the required answer is:** It's very specific ("He is reading a book."). No variations like "A book he is reading" are acceptable, which makes it harder for those not fully grasping SVO.
*   **Common mistakes my students make:**
    *   Missing the capital letter for 'He'.
    *   Forgetting the full stop.
    *   Incorrect word order, especially for the verb phrase "is reading" or placing the article "a" correctly. Some might put "He reading is a book." or "Is he reading a book?" (turning it into a question).
    *   Mixing up "reading" and "book" if they struggle with vocabulary.

Here's my estimated breakdown:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 30% full marks
competent: 80% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
