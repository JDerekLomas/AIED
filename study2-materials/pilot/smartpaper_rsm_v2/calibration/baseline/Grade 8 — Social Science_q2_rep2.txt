Alright, this is a very common type of question we get in Class 8 Social Science, especially on the Harappan Civilization. Let's break down how my students would likely perform.

**Thinking Process for this question:**

*   **Language barriers:** This is a major hurdle. "Key feature," "urban planning," "Harappan Civilization" – these are all terms that struggling and even some basic-level students might not fully grasp in English, even if they know the Hindi equivalents (मुख्य विशेषता, शहरी योजना, हड़प्पा सभ्यता). I've likely taught it in Hindi primarily, so they'd be translating mentally.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is purely a recall question. They either remember a specific feature or they don't. There's no complex reasoning required, which can be good for some, but bad for those who just haven't memorized it.
*   **Specificity of the answer:** The rubric allows for several correct answers (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town). This is helpful, as if they remember just one, they can score. However, they need to describe it, not just name it. "Baked bricks" alone might not be enough; "use of baked bricks for construction" would be better.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Vague answers:** "They had good cities." (Too general)
    *   **Partial answers:** "Drainage." (Needs more detail: "advanced drainage system")
    *   **Misremembering details:** Confusing Harappan features with later periods.
    *   **Translating literally from Hindi:** Sometimes their English translation comes out awkward and hard to understand.
    *   **Not understanding "urban planning":** They might talk about their agriculture or crafts instead of city design.
    *   **Difficulty with writing in English:** Even if they know the answer in their head, expressing it clearly and correctly in English is a challenge for many.

Let's estimate the percentages:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   A very small number might have just enough recall and luck with their English to get one point. They might remember "pakki eent" (baked bricks) and manage to write "They used baked bricks." But most will struggle with the language, the concepts, or simply not recall enough specific detail.

**basic: 30% full marks**
*   Many at this level would remember one or two features, especially the "drainage system" (naliyon ka prabandh) or "grid pattern" (jaali dar sadken). The challenge here will be articulating it precisely enough in English to meet the "describes" criterion. Some might just write "Drainage system" and miss the "advanced" or "well-planned" part, potentially losing a mark depending on strictness.

**competent: 80% full marks**
*   These students generally grasp the concepts well in class, regardless of language of instruction. They would have a good recall of key features like the grid layout, the impressive drainage, or the division into citadel and lower town. Their English writing, while not perfect, would be sufficient to describe one feature clearly.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   These students typically excel. They understand the question clearly, have strong recall, and can express their answer effectively in English. They would likely pick one of the prominent features and describe it accurately, often adding a bit more detail than strictly necessary. The 5% not scoring full marks might be due to a very rare oversight or a minor grammatical error that makes the description less clear.
