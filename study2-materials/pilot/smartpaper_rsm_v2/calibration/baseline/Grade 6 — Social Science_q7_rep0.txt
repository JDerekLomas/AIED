Namaste, bachcho! Aayiye, aaj hum Rajasthan ke prakritik sansadhanon ke baare mein kuch seekhen.

**Question:** Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there. (राजस्थान में पाए जाने वाले किन्हीं दो प्राकृतिक संसाधनों का नाम बताएं और समझाएं कि उनमें से एक वहां के लोगों के जीवन को कैसे प्रभावित करता है।)

**Let's break down how my students would perform:**

**Thinking process for evaluation:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The question is in English. While I would have usually translated or explained it in Hindi during class, for an assessment item presented as is, the English itself is a hurdle for many. "Natural resources" (प्राकृतिक संसाधन) is a key term, as is "influences" (प्रभावित करता है).
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:**
    *   **Recall:** Naming two natural resources is recall. We've discussed these in class, often through maps and examples.
    *   **Reasoning:** Explaining the influence requires a bit more reasoning and understanding of cause-and-effect. This is where many might falter, moving beyond just rote memorization.
*   **Specificity:** The answer needs *two* resources and an *explanation* for *one*. Just listing isn't enough for full marks.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Listing only one resource.
    *   Listing resources not found in Rajasthan (e.g., coal or petroleum in large quantities, which are more associated with other states).
    *   Simply stating *what* the resource is, instead of *how it influences* lives (e.g., "Marble is used for buildings" instead of "Marble provides jobs to many sculptors and quarry workers, and is a major export, bringing income to the state").
    *   Struggling to articulate the "how it influences" part in English. They might know it in Hindi but can't frame it properly in English.
    *   Focusing on general uses rather than specific *influence on people's lives*.

Given these considerations, here's my breakdown:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*   They might recognize "Rajasthan" but struggle with "natural resources" and "influences." Even if they identify one resource, explaining its impact in English would be too difficult. They are likely to leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant.

**basic:** 10% full marks
*   Many in this group might correctly identify one or even two natural resources (e.g., water, marble, sand).
*   However, the "explain how it influences" part is where they will mostly lose marks. They might say "water is important" or "marble makes houses," but not elaborate on *how it influences people's lives* (e.g., livelihood, migration, daily chores, economic impact). Their English phrasing will also be very basic and likely insufficient for a full explanation. Some might get partial marks for correctly identifying two resources.

**competent:** 60% full marks
*   Most in this group will correctly identify two natural resources (e.g., Water and Marble, or Copper and Gypsum).
*   They will attempt to explain the influence. For example, for water, they might mention "lack of water leads to hardship for farmers" or "people have to travel far to get water." For marble, they might say "many people work in marble mines and factories." Their English will be understandable, though perhaps not perfectly grammatical. They are more likely to articulate the impact on lives rather than just usage.

**advanced:** 90% full marks
*   These students will confidently identify two appropriate natural resources.
*   They will provide a clear and coherent explanation of how one resource influences the lives of people. For example, for water, they might discuss its scarcity, the impact on agriculture, the need for conservation, or the daily struggle for fetching water, and its effect on migration. For a mineral like Marble, they might detail its economic importance, the jobs it creates (mining, sculpting, trading), and its contribution to the state's revenue. Their English will be relatively strong and allow for a detailed explanation. They understand the nuances of "influences people's lives." The 10% not getting full marks might be due to a minor grammatical error or a slightly less detailed explanation, but they would still score very high.
