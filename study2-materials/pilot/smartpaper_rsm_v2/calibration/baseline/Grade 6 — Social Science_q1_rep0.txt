Here's my assessment based on my experience teaching Class 6 Social Science in an Indian government school, considering the student profile:

**struggling: 10% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they know the names in Hindi, reading and recognizing them in English will be very difficult for many.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall. They either know it or they don't.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Many would likely leave it blank. Some might attempt to write something they remember from a map (like a state name) but not a mountain range. Some might misspell significantly.

**basic: 40% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They might be able to read some words and recognize "mountain ranges." If we've extensively used maps with both English and Hindi labels, they might pick up one or two names.
*   **Recall:** They would likely recall the most prominent ones, especially the Himalayas, as it's often emphasized.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might only be able to recall one, or make spelling mistakes that might make it hard to identify. Some might confuse it with a river or a plateau if not very clear on the concepts.

**competent: 80% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** They would generally be able to read and understand the question.
*   **Recall:** They would likely recall at least two major ranges. The Himalayas and Aravallis are very common, and many would also know Vindhyas or Satpuras.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Occasional minor spelling errors, but the names would be recognizable.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here.
*   **Recall:** They would easily recall multiple mountain ranges and pick two. They might even list more than two.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very rare for them to make a mistake on this type of question. Perhaps a very minor spelling slip, but the answer would be correct.
