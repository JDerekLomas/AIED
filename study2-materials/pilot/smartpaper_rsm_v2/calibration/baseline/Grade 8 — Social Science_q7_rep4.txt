Here's my breakdown based on my experience with Class 8 Social Science students in a government school:

**Common Challenges and Thinking Process:**

*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they know the historical facts in Hindi, articulating it precisely in English is tough for most. "Establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal" is a specific phrase that many will struggle to form.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question primarily requires recall of a key consequence of Plassey. While understanding "how it contributed" involves a degree of reasoning, the expected answer is a direct consequence (control over Bengal).
*   **Specificity:** The rubric requires "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This level of specificity is high for many.
    *   Struggling students might just say "British won" or "British got powerful."
    *   Basic students might say "British got Bengal" or "Mir Jafar became king, British controlled him."
    *   Even competent students might struggle with the phrase "political dominance."
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Over-generalization: "British became strong."
    *   Focusing on economic aspects: "British got more money." (While true later, the immediate political dominance is the key for Plassey).
    *   Listing events without linking to the 'contribution' aspect.
    *   Grammatical errors and incomplete sentences making their answer unclear, even if they have some understanding.
    *   Confusing Plassey with other battles or events.
    *   Simply stating that Mir Jafar was made Nawab without explicitly connecting it to British "control" or "dominance."

**Percentage Full Marks:**

*   **Struggling (35%):** 0% full marks. They might recall "British won" or "Mir Jafar" but won't be able to articulate the political dominance aspect clearly in English.
*   **Basic (35%):** 5% full marks. A very small fraction of these students, perhaps those who recently revised this topic thoroughly and have slightly better recall and expression, might manage to hit the core idea of "British controlled Bengal" or "Mir Jafar became puppet Nawab." Most will get partial credit for mentioning Mir Jafar or British getting Bengal, but not the *political dominance* aspect.
*   **Competent (20%):** 30% full marks. These students have a better grasp of concepts and can express themselves reasonably well. They are more likely to use terms like "control," "influence," or "puppet ruler" and link it directly to Bengal. However, even some here might miss the specific phrasing of "political dominance."
*   **Advanced (10%):** 70% full marks. These students usually have good recall, understand the nuance of the event, and can frame their answer logically in English, even if with minor grammatical errors. They are most likely to explicitly state the British gaining political control or making Mir Jafar a puppet nawab, directly addressing the "contribution to expansion of British power" aspect.
