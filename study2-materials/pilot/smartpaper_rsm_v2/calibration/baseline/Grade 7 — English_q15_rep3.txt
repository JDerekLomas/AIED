Here's how I'd assess the scoring based on my experience with Class 7 English students in a government school:

**struggling:** 0% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** Many struggling students would find it difficult to even read and comprehend the prompt "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." The length requirement (4-5 sentences) would be a major barrier. They might write one or two broken sentences, often in a mix of Hindi and English, or simply list a word or two for a hobby. Constructing a coherent paragraph with flow and meeting all three criteria (what, when, why) would be beyond their current capabilities. Spelling and grammar errors would be rampant.

**basic:** 10% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** Students at the basic level might understand the prompt's core meaning and attempt to answer. They might write 2-3 simple sentences, often quite short and grammatically flawed. They might mention the hobby and when they do it, but struggle to articulate "why" they enjoy it in complete English sentences. The "4-5 sentences" requirement would still be a challenge. Those who get full marks would likely be the very top end of the "basic" group, perhaps managing to string together four very simple sentences, even with minor errors, that address all parts of the prompt. Most would fall short on sentence count or articulating the "why."

**competent:** 60% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** Competent students would largely understand the prompt and its requirements. They would be able to generate ideas for their hobby and generally articulate the "what," "when," and "why." Their paragraphs might have some grammatical errors or awkward phrasing, but they would largely meet the sentence count and cover all three aspects of the prompt. The language would be understandable, even if not perfectly fluent. Some might struggle slightly with sentence connectors or varying sentence structures, but the core information would be present.

**advanced:** 90% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** Advanced students would confidently tackle this task. They would write a well-structured paragraph, meeting the sentence count. Their language would be relatively accurate, with good vocabulary and sentence construction. They would clearly state their hobby, when they do it, and provide good reasons for why they enjoy it, perhaps even adding an extra detail or two. Minor errors might still occur, but the overall quality would be high, demonstrating a good grasp of basic paragraph writing skills. The remaining 10% might make a careless mistake (e.g., writing only 3 sentences instead of 4-5) or have a very minor grammatical slip that prevents a "perfect" score, but their overall understanding and ability would be clear.
