Here's my assessment based on the student profiles:

*   **Struggling:** **10% full marks**
    *   *Reasoning:* These students often struggle with basic word recognition, let alone understanding the grammatical structure needed for rearrangement. They might pick out "book" and "reading" and "he" but won't know how to put them in the correct SVO order. They might produce something like "Reading he book is a" or just list the words. The *is* and *a* might be particularly confusing for placement.
*   **Basic:** **40% full marks**
    *   *Reasoning:* Students at this level have some foundational understanding. They'll recognize common verbs like "is" and action words like "reading." Many will have encountered simple SVO sentences before, perhaps through rote learning or very basic pattern recognition. However, some might still struggle with the exact placement of "a" or the auxiliary verb "is" if they try to translate directly from Hindi sentence structure. Common mistakes might be "He reading is a book" or "He is a book reading."
*   **Competent:** **85% full marks**
    *   *Reasoning:* These students have a decent grasp of basic English sentence structure. They've likely practiced similar exercises and can identify the subject, verb, and object with relative ease for simple sentences. They understand the "is + -ing" present continuous structure. Minor errors might occur, but the majority would get this correct.
*   **Advanced:** **100% full marks**
    *   *Reasoning:* This is a very straightforward sentence rearrangement for students at an advanced level. They would immediately identify the subject, verb, and object and correctly apply the SVO structure without hesitation. They understand present continuous tense perfectly.
