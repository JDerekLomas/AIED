This is a classic "trick" question that preys on common misconceptions. The question asks for an *adjective phrase*, but the sentence only contains an *adjective* ("tiny"). An adjective phrase would be something like "very tiny" or "tiny and brown".

Here's how I think my students would perform:

struggling: 0% full marks
* They might struggle to even read the full sentence.
* The concept of "phrase" is likely new or very confusing.
* If they guess, they might point to "bird" or "nest" or "balcony".
* They might just point to "tiny" because it describes "bird" without understanding "phrase".

basic: 5% full marks
* Some might identify "tiny" as describing "bird".
* However, very few would understand the difference between an adjective and an adjective *phrase*.
* They might pick "tiny bird" as a phrase, which is a noun phrase, or just "tiny" (which is an adjective, not a phrase).
* The nuance of "adjective phrase" versus "adjective" will be missed by almost all.

competent: 10% full marks
* This group understands adjectives well. They would immediately identify "tiny" as the adjective.
* The key challenge is the word "phrase." Most would likely write "tiny" because it's the adjective. A very small percentage (the 10%) might recognize that there isn't an adjective *phrase* and either leave it blank or correctly state that there isn't one. The rubric, however, scores "tiny" as full marks, which is problematic given the question. If the rubric *strictly* adheres to "adjective phrase," then very few would score. If it accepts "tiny" as the intent, then more might. Given the specific wording of the question and rubric, it's very tricky. I'm going with a lower estimate assuming they are looking for an *actual* phrase.

advanced: 50% full marks
* This group has a better grasp of grammar. They would easily identify "tiny" as the adjective.
* The more advanced among them (half) might recognize that there isn't an adjective *phrase* in the sentence, as "tiny" is just an adjective. They would either state there isn't one or perhaps write "tiny" and then question the "phrase" part.
* If the *intent* of the question is to identify the descriptive word, and the rubric scores "tiny" as correct, then more would get it. But strictly speaking, there isn't an adjective *phrase*. The ambiguity between the question and the rubric is significant. I'm assuming half would understand the distinction and perhaps either write "none" or "tiny" and explain, but if "tiny" is the sole correct answer, then it's a trap for those who know better. My 50% reflects that half might correctly identify there is no *phrase* of that type, while the other half might guess "tiny" thinking the question is just poorly worded.

**Revisiting based on the rubric:** "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective. Max score: 1"

Given this rubric, it explicitly ignores the "phrase" part of the question and just looks for the adjective. This changes things significantly, as it makes the question much simpler than it appears.

struggling: 10% full marks
* A few might randomly pick "tiny" from the sentence, or recall that words like "tiny" describe things. They wouldn't understand "adjective phrase" at all.

basic: 30% full marks
* Many in this group can identify basic adjectives if prompted. They know words like "tiny" describe size. They still won't get the "phrase" part, but if the rubric only looks for "tiny," they have a better chance.

competent: 70% full marks
* They would easily identify "tiny" as the adjective. The "phrase" part would be a distractor, but since the rubric focuses only on the adjective, they would score well.

advanced: 95% full marks
* They would immediately pinpoint "tiny" as the adjective. They might inwardly groan at the "phrase" misnomer in the question, but they'd know "tiny" is the target if the goal is the descriptive word.

This correction based on the rubric highlights how rubrics can drastically alter student performance expectations, especially when there's a mismatch between the question's wording and the scoring criteria.
