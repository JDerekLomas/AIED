This is a very common type of question in our Social Science class, and one we try to make accessible even with language barriers.

struggling: 10% full marks
basic: 50% full marks
competent: 90% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning for the percentages:**

*   **Language barriers:** While the question is in English, "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" uses fairly straightforward vocabulary that we would have covered multiple times, often with diagrams and maps. Crucially, I would have always written the names of these ranges on the board, often in both English and Hindi script, and had students point them out on maps. The difficulty isn't in understanding the individual words as much as in processing the whole sentence if their English reading speed is very slow.

*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is pure recall. There's no reasoning required, just remembering factual information. This can be a double-edged sword: if they've memorized it, it's easy; if they haven't, there's no way to deduce it.

*   **Specificity:** "Any two" makes it relatively easy. They have several major options (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats). We definitely focus on the Himalayas and Aravalli in Class 6 as they are quite prominent and often discussed in the context of history and geography.

*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Struggling students:** Many will simply not be able to recall *any* names, even if they recognize the concept of mountains. Their memorization skills might be weak, or their attention during class discussions on maps might have been limited. Some might write "mountain" in Hindi (pahad) or struggle to spell the English names correctly, even if they vaguely remember them. Writing only one correct name is also a common error for full marks.
    *   **Basic students:** Most would recall at least one name, likely "Himalayas." Recalling a second correct name might be the challenge for some in this group. They might struggle with spelling, leading to partial marks depending on strictness.
    *   **Competent/Advanced students:** These students usually have a good grasp of the key geographical features. They would have memorized multiple names and would be able to recall two with ease and spell them reasonably accurately.

**Why the numbers are what they are:**

*   **Struggling (10%):** A very small percentage might get lucky and remember one name or have a particularly good day. The struggle here is primarily recall of specific English terms and spelling, even if they understand the general concept of mountains in India.
*   **Basic (50%):** Many in this group would remember the Himalayas. Getting a second one (like Aravalli, which is also very prominent) might be a toss-up. So, roughly half would manage two correct.
*   **Competent (90%):** This is foundational knowledge. They are expected to know these major features. The 10% miss might be due to a momentary mental block or a minor spelling error leading to a slight deduction, not a complete lack of knowledge.
*   **Advanced (95%):** These students typically excel at factual recall and spelling. A very rare slip-up might occur, but it's highly unlikely for them to not know two major mountain ranges.
