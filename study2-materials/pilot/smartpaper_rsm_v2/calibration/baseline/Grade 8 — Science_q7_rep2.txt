Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 8 students in a government school, keeping all the specified constraints in mind.

**Analysis of the Question:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The English is fairly straightforward for a science question, but "pit," "beneficial," and "evaluate" might be tricky for struggling students. "Collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits" is descriptive enough.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires a combination.
    *   **Recall:** Knowledge of decomposition, the role of microorganisms, and the concept of compost/manure.
    *   **Reasoning:** Applying that knowledge to predict changes and then evaluating its benefit for soil health.
*   **Specificity of Answer:**
    *   "Significant changes" - vague enough that many could get it.
    *   "Reasons" - requires explaining decomposition/microbes.
    *   "Beneficial for soil health" - requires linking decomposition to nutrient enrichment.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Struggling students might just say "yes, it will change" without reasons.
    *   Some might think it just "dries up" or "rots" without understanding the *process* of decomposition.
    *   Difficulty articulating the benefit in scientific terms (e.g., "makes the soil healthy" instead of "enriches soil with nutrients").
    *   Confusion with burning waste vs. composting.

**Predicted Full Mark Scores (0.5/0.5):**

*   **struggling: 5% full marks**
    *   Very few struggling students would be able to articulate both the *change*, the *reason* (decomposition/microbes), and the *benefit* in a clear, concise manner that fully addresses the question. They might say "yes, it will change" or "it will rot" but struggle with the 'why' and the 'how it benefits soil'. They often lack the vocabulary and conceptual grasp.
*   **basic: 30% full marks**
    *   These students will likely recognize that it changes and "rots." Many might even mention "khad ban jayegi" (manure will form) or "mitti acchi hogi." The challenge for them will be to explicitly state "decomposition" or "microorganisms" as the reason and connect it strongly to "nutrient enrichment" for soil health. They might get 0.25 or 0.35 but struggle for the full 0.5.
*   **competent: 75% full marks**
    *   Most competent students would be able to articulate the changes, the concept of decomposition (though maybe not always using "microorganisms" directly, but implying it), and the benefit to soil. They have a better grasp of the vocabulary and can construct a more complete answer. They might miss a very specific scientific term but get the essence.
*   **advanced: 95% full marks**
    *   Advanced students would comfortably answer this, using appropriate terminology like "decomposition," "microorganisms," "manure/compost," and "nutrient enrichment" or "improves soil fertility/structure." They can articulate the process and its benefits clearly and comprehensively.
