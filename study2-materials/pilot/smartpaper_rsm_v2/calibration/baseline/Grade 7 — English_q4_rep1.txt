Okay, this is a very common scenario in my Class 7 English classroom. Let's break down this question and predict student performance.

The question itself requires:
1.  **Reading Comprehension:** Understanding "king's questions" and "important in real life."
2.  **Recall/Inference:** Knowing *what* the king's questions were (right time, right people, right thing) – though the rubric implies this is the *basis* for a valid answer, not the *answer itself*. The question is more about the *importance*.
3.  **Reasoning/Personal Connection:** Thinking about why these specific questions (or the *idea* of these questions) are relevant to their own lives or general life wisdom.
4.  **Expression:** Articulating a reason in English.

**Language Barriers:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?" has several potential pitfalls:
*   "King's questions": If they haven't internalised the story or can't recall the specific questions, they're stuck.
*   "Important in real life": They might understand "important" but connecting it to "real life" and then articulating *why* is tough.
*   "Give one reason": This often gets ignored, or they give a reason that isn't connected to the "importance."

**Recall vs. Reasoning:** The question primarily asks for *reasoning* based on the *recall* of the questions. If they can't recall the questions, their reasoning will be flawed or absent. The rubric helps by stating *what* the king wanted to answer, so even a vague reference to those themes might be considered.

**Specificity of Answer:** "Any valid reason" is quite open, which is good. It doesn't require a very specific phrase. However, the reason still needs to connect to the *importance* of those questions.

**Common Mistakes:**
*   **Not understanding the question:** Answering something like "Yes, the king was wise" without a reason.
*   **Recalling story details, not answering the question:** "Yes, the hermit answered his questions."
*   **Lack of vocabulary:** Having a thought but not being able to express it. "Good life," "happy life," "don't make mistakes" are common attempts.
*   **One-word answers:** "Yes."
*   **Translating literally from Hindi:** This often results in grammatically incorrect or awkward English that might convey the gist but not meet the "valid reason" criterion effectively.

Here's my prediction:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   They will struggle to read the question itself. Even if read aloud, comprehending "king's questions" and "important in real life" simultaneously will be too much.
*   They are unlikely to recall the specific questions from the passage.
*   Formulating *any* coherent sentence in English as a reason will be extremely difficult for this group. They might just write "Yes" or copy a line from the story that doesn't answer the question.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   Many will be able to read the question, perhaps with some difficulty or needing it read aloud.
*   They might recall vaguely that the king had some important questions, but struggle to articulate *what* they were.
*   A small percentage might grasp the concept of "important in real life" and be able to articulate a very simple, direct reason, such as "Yes, because we should know what to do" or "It helps us live better." The "any valid reason" is their best friend here. They'll be on the cusp of getting it right, but usually their expression will be too clunky or incomplete.

**competent: 50% full marks**
*   They will read and understand the question well.
*   They will recall the king's questions (right time, right people, right thing).
*   They can usually form a grammatically acceptable sentence.
*   Many will be able to connect it to real life, e.g., "Yes, because if we know the right time and people, we can make good decisions," or "These questions help us live a successful life." The openness of "any valid reason" works in their favour here. The other 50% might give a reason but it's either too vague or poorly expressed.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   They will fully understand the question and recall the king's questions immediately.
*   They will be able to articulate a clear, concise, and grammatically correct reason, often elaborating slightly.
*   Examples: "Yes, because knowing the right time, the right people, and the
