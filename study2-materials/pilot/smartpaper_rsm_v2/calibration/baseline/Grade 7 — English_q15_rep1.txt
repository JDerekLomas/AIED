Here's my assessment based on my experience:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 10% full marks
competent: 60% full marks
advanced: 90% full marks

**Reasoning:**

*   **Struggling (35% of class):** These students often struggle to form even simple sentences correctly. "My Favourite Hobby" might elicit a single word or a very broken phrase like "My hobby play." The requirement of "a complete paragraph (4-5 sentences)" is a massive hurdle. They might get one or two words right but will not be able to structure it into meaningful sentences, let alone a paragraph. Reading the prompt itself would be challenging for many.

*   **Basic (35% of class):** These students can usually understand the prompt and produce simple, albeit often grammatically imperfect, sentences. They might write 2-3 sentences, but structuring it into a coherent 4-5 sentence paragraph addressing all three points (what, when, why) consistently will be difficult for most. They might forget one aspect or repeat themselves. For example, they might write: "My hobby is drawing. I draw in evening. I like drawing very much." This is 3 sentences, not 4-5, and "why" is very rudimentary. The 10% I'm estimating would be those who, with a bit of effort, can stretch their thoughts into 4 sentences, even if they aren't perfect.

*   **Competent (20% of class):** These students have a better grasp of sentence structure and can generally form complete thoughts. They would understand the need for 4-5 sentences and the three required elements. Their main challenge might be vocabulary to express "why" they enjoy it in a more varied way than just "I like it." Some might write 3 good sentences and struggle to add two more meaningful ones without repetition, or they might write 5 sentences but one or two are a bit awkward. They have the *ability* to do it, but might make minor mistakes preventing a "perfect" score. The 60% represents those who would successfully meet all criteria clearly, even if with a few minor grammatical slips that don't hinder comprehension.

*   **Advanced (10% of class):** These students are comfortable with English, can express themselves clearly, and understand the nuances of a prompt. They would easily write 4-5 grammatically correct sentences, covering all points with reasonable detail and varied vocabulary. They might even add a concluding thought. The 10% not getting full marks might be due to a very rare oversight (e.g., writing 3 sentences by mistake) or a surprisingly awkward sentence structure. They are generally reliable for such tasks.

**Common Mistakes Students Make:**

*   **Sentence fragmentation or run-on sentences:** Especially for struggling and basic levels.
*   **Grammatical errors:** Subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, prepositions, articles.
*   **Lack of vocabulary:** Repeating "I like it" or "It is good" for the "why" aspect.
*   **Not meeting the length requirement:** Writing only 1-3 sentences.
*   **Missing one of the required elements:** Forgetting to mention "when" or "why."
*   **Direct translation from Hindi:** Leading to unidiomatic English.
*   **Difficulty with paragraph structure:** Treating each sentence as a standalone thought rather than flowing into a paragraph.
*   **Reading comprehension:** Some might misunderstand parts of the prompt, especially if it requires a sustained focus on multiple instructions.
