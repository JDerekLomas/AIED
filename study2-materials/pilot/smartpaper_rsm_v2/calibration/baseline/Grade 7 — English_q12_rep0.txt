This is a great question that really makes me think about my students!

Here's my breakdown based on their typical understanding and common challenges:

**struggling:** 0-5% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** Many of these students struggle with basic sentence comprehension in English, let alone grammatical transformations. They might recognize "wind" and "leaves" but not grasp "blew away" as an action in relation to an object. The concept of active/passive voice would be completely alien. Even if I've taught it, recall is very weak for them. They'd likely try to rearrange the words randomly or simply repeat the original sentence. "By the wind" is a very complex concept for them.

**basic:** 15-25% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** These students might vaguely recall that "something changes" when we talk about active and passive voice. They might identify "leaves" as the object and try to start with it. However, the past tense "were blown" is a common hurdle. They often default to "are" or "is" or struggle with the past participle form of irregular verbs like "blow" (blew -> blown). The "by the wind" part might also be forgotten or incorrectly placed. Many would produce something like "The leaves were blow away" or "The leaves are blew away."

**competent:** 60-70% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** These students have a decent grasp of basic grammar and can usually identify the subject, verb, and object. They would know to start with "The leaves" and understand the need for a "to be" verb and a past participle. Their main challenges might be:
    *   Getting the correct form of "to be" (were) if they're rushing or confused by other past tense contexts.
    *   Recalling the past participle "blown." While many know it, irregular verbs are still a common point of error.
    *   Correctly including "by the wind" at the end. Some might miss it or misplace it.
    *   They've likely practiced similar transformations and can apply the rules, even if they occasionally make a minor error.

**advanced:** 90-100% full marks
*   **Reasoning:** These students typically understand grammatical structures well. They would immediately identify the active voice, the subject, verb, and object. They would correctly form the passive voice, remembering the past tense "were," the past participle "blown," and the agent "by the wind." They have the recall for irregular verbs and the reasoning to apply the transformation rules accurately. Their errors would be rare, perhaps a slip of the pen or an accidental omission rather than a conceptual misunderstanding.
