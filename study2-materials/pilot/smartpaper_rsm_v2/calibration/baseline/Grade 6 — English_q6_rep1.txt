This is a great question that makes me think about my students! Let's break it down.

First, the context of the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" is crucial. If this question is asked *immediately* after reading a poem for the first time, the scores will be much lower. If it's asked after multiple readings, discussions, and perhaps even some activities related to the poem, the scores will be higher. Let's assume a reasonable scenario where the poem has been read and briefly discussed, but not exhaustively analyzed, as it's Class 6.

**Common Challenges and Mistakes:**

*   **Reading Comprehension:** Many struggling and even some basic students will have difficulty simply reading and understanding the prompt itself, let alone the poem.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires *both* recall (remembering lines from the poem) and reasoning (explaining *why* they like it). The "why" is often the bigger hurdle.
*   **Vocabulary:** Explaining *why* they like a line might require a vocabulary they don't possess in English. They might know in Hindi but struggle to translate.
*   **Expression:** Even if they have an idea, expressing it coherently and grammatically in English is a major challenge. Many will give one-word answers or very short, vague phrases.
*   **Shyness/Lack of Confidence:** Some students, especially struggling ones, might be hesitant to answer for fear of making mistakes.
*   **Copying:** Some might try to copy a line, but then struggle with the "why."
*   **Literal Interpretation:** The "why" might be very literal (e.g., "I like it because the bird is flying"). They might not grasp deeper meanings or personal connections easily.
*   **The "Most" Part:** Some students might just pick *any* line rather than truly the one they "like the most" because it's easier.

Let's assume the poem is something relatively simple and engaging for Class 6, like "The Swing" or "Where the Mind is Without Fear" (simplified), or a poem about nature/animals.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Why so low?** These students often struggle to read the question itself. Even if I read it aloud and explain, they have difficulty recalling a specific line. If they manage to write a line, the "why" will almost certainly be absent, very vague, or in Hindi. The requirement to denote a specific line *and* explain *why* is a double challenge. Many will write nothing, or just one word related to the poem.

**basic: 20% full marks**
*   **Why this percentage?** A good chunk of these students will be able to identify *a* line from the poem, especially if it's a prominent or memorable one. However, the "why" is where most will fall short. They might give a very simple, one-word reason ("nice," "good," "happy") or a phrase that doesn't fully explain their liking ("I like this line because it tells about..." without elaborating *why* that specific aspect appeals to them). They might also copy a line correctly but struggle immensely with the explanation, often providing an incomplete sentence or just a few disconnected words. Some might even provide the *meaning* of the line instead of *why they like it*.

**competent: 60% full marks**
*   **Why this percentage?** These students generally understand the question. They can read and recall a line. They will likely attempt to explain *why* they like it. The "why" might still be somewhat basic but will be coherent and grammatically acceptable enough to meet the rubric. For example, "I like the line 'Up in the air and over the wall' because it makes me imagine flying high like a bird, and I want to fly." This shows a clear line and a reasonable explanation. They might not use sophisticated vocabulary but can convey their point.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*   **Why so high?** These students usually grasp the nuances of the question. They can easily recall lines and articulate their reasons clearly and thoughtfully. Their explanations will likely be more detailed, perhaps showing a personal connection, an understanding of imagery, or an appreciation for the poet's language. They would likely use complete, grammatically correct sentences and more appropriate vocabulary. They might even try to explain the *feeling* the line evokes. The only reason it's not 100% is human error or perhaps a momentary lapse in recall/articulation.
