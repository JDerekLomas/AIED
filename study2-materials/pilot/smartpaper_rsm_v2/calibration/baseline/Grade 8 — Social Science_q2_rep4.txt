Here's my assessment based on my experience:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 25% full marks
competent: 70% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**

*   **Language Barriers:** This is a major hurdle. Even if they know the answer in Hindi, translating it accurately and concisely into English (especially for specific terms like "grid layout" or "baked bricks") will be tough. Many might understand "well-planned city" but struggle to articulate a *key feature* using precise English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question primarily requires recall of factual information. While understanding is important, the answer is a specific detail about urban planning.
*   **Specificity:** The required answer is quite specific. "Well-planned city" might be too general for full marks; they need to mention *how* it was well-planned (grid layout, drainage, etc.). This level of detail is harder for students with limited vocabulary and conceptual grasp in English.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Vague answers:** "Harappan cities were very good." or "They had good houses."
    *   **Incorrect details:** Confusing features with other civilizations or just making up details.
    *   **Hindi influence:** Trying to translate directly from Hindi, resulting in grammatically awkward or unclear English.
    *   **Partial answers:** Mentioning one aspect (like bricks) but not elaborating enough to show it's a *key feature* of urban planning.
    *   **Not understanding "urban planning":** Some might simply list anything they remember about the Harappan civilization without connecting it to the specific concept of city planning. For example, they might talk about agriculture or seals.

**Breakdown by group:**

*   **Struggling (35% of total students):** Very few will score full marks. Even if they've heard about the planned cities, recalling a specific feature and expressing it clearly in English is a huge challenge. They might get a partial mark for "planned cities" but not the specific "grid layout" or "drainage system."
*   **Basic (35% of total students):** A quarter of this group might manage it. They might recall "good drainage system" or "straight roads" but might struggle with more technical terms like "grid pattern" or "citadel." Their English might be basic, but they could convey one feature somewhat accurately.
*   **Competent (20% of total students):** The majority here should get it. They have a better grasp of English and are more likely to have internalized specific terms like "grid layout" or "advanced drainage system" from classroom discussions. They can usually articulate one key feature clearly.
*   **Advanced (10% of total students):** Almost all of them would score full marks. They have good recall, strong English proficiency, and understand the nuances of the question. They would likely provide a clear, concise, and accurate answer using appropriate terminology.
