This is a trickier question than it first appears, especially for the specified student demographic and given the specific wording ("adjective phrase").

Here's my breakdown:

*   **The Trap:** The question asks for an "adjective phrase," but the given sentence only has an "adjective" ("tiny") modifying a noun. "Tiny" itself isn't a phrase. An adjective phrase would be something like "very tiny" or "tiny but beautiful."

*   **Impact on Students:**
    *   **Struggling/Basic:** Many won't even understand "adjective phrase." They might just look for *any* descriptive word. If they're guessing based on "adjective," they might pick "tiny." If they try to identify a "phrase," they'll be lost.
    *   **Competent:** Some might correctly identify "tiny" as an adjective. They might then be confused by "phrase" and either pick "tiny" as the closest thing or say there isn't one. A few might even try to combine "tiny bird" or "its nest" if they misunderstand "phrase" completely.
    *   **Advanced:** These students are most likely to spot the distinction. They would either identify "tiny" as the adjective but state there's no *adjective phrase* or, if forced to choose from the sentence as given, they might just pick "tiny" as the core of what the question is getting at, assuming a slight inaccuracy in the question's premise given the context.

*   **Scoring Rubric:** "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This rubric simplifies the question, effectively asking students to identify the *adjective*, not an *adjective phrase*. This changes the expected outcome significantly. If the rubric *required* them to state "there is no adjective phrase," then the scores would be much lower across the board.

Given the rubric focuses on identifying "tiny" as an adjective, here's my estimate:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*(They might randomly pick it, or some might recognize "tiny" as describing the bird, even if they don't know the term 'adjective'. Very low chance.)*

**basic: 25% full marks**
*(Some will have a basic understanding of what a describing word is, and 'tiny' is quite obvious. They might ignore 'phrase' or not even process it fully, just focusing on 'adjective'.)*

**competent: 70% full marks**
*(They would likely identify 'tiny' as an adjective. The 'phrase' part might confuse them, but given the rubric, if they just write 'tiny', they score. They are more likely to correctly identify descriptive words.)*

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*(They definitely know 'tiny' is an adjective. They might hesitate because it's not a 'phrase', but understanding the likely intent of the question in a Class 7 setting and the simplified rubric, they'd provide 'tiny'.)*
