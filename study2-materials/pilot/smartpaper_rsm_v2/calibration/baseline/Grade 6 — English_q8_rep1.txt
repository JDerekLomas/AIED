This is a good question that highlights the realities of teaching English in government schools in India. Let's break down how my students would likely perform on this item.

**Overall thought process:**
This task, while seemingly simple for a native English speaker, presents several hurdles for my students.
*   **Reading the words:** Many struggling students would have difficulty even decoding all the words, especially "reading."
*   **Vocabulary:** "Reading" might be a known verb, but its function in a sentence structure needs to be understood.
*   **Sentence structure:** The most common mistake would be trying to form a sentence that translates directly from Hindi grammar, which often places the verb at the end. For example, "He a book reading is" or "A book he is reading."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This task requires both recall (knowing basic subject-verb-object structure) and reasoning (applying that structure to these specific words). For struggling students, it's almost entirely reasoning from limited recall. For advanced students, it's mostly recall.
*   **Specificity:** The required answer is very specific. Any deviation from SVO would likely result in no marks.

Here's my breakdown by ability level:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   Most of these students would struggle to even read all the words correctly.
*   They might try to form very rudimentary sentences, possibly just stringing words together.
*   They would highly likely struggle with the correct verb placement and auxiliary verb "is."
*   A common attempt might be "He book reading" or "Book he reading." The chance of them getting "is" in the correct place is very low.

**basic: 30% full marks**
*   These students can likely read most of the words.
*   They might have some exposure to simple SVO sentences but struggle to consistently apply it.
*   They might try various permutations. Some might get "He is reading a book," but many would still fall into the trap of Hindi-influenced grammar like "He a book reading is" or "He reading a book is."
*   The "is" is a key challenge for them in placement.

**competent: 80% full marks**
*   These students have a fair grasp of basic English sentence structure.
*   They have likely encountered and practiced SVO sentences multiple times.
*   They can read all the words and understand their basic meaning.
*   The placement of "is" and the verb "reading" together would be more natural for them.
*   A small percentage might still make a minor error due to overthinking or a momentary lapse, perhaps omitting "a" or mixing up "is" and "reading" slightly.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   These students would find this task relatively straightforward.
*   They have a solid understanding of basic English grammar and SVO structure is second nature.
*   They would read the words, immediately identify the subject, verb, and object components, and assemble them correctly without much hesitation.
*   The only reason it's not 100% is the possibility of a silly mistake – perhaps misreading a word in a hurry or momentarily mixing up an article, but it's very unlikely for this specific set of words.
