Okay, let's break this down based on my experience in a Class 7 English classroom with similar demographics.

The question "Describes the poet's writing style" requires a student to not just understand the poem but also to identify a specific literary characteristic and then articulate it using appropriate vocabulary. This is challenging for many students, especially those from Hindi-medium backgrounds.

Here's my prediction for each group:

*   **Language barriers:** Many struggling and basic students will find the phrase "writing style" abstract. They might understand "what the poet wrote about" (content) but not "how the poet wrote it."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This primarily requires reasoning and analysis of the text. While they might have been taught a few stylistic terms, applying them correctly to an unseen or recently read poem is difficult. It's not a direct recall question like "Who is the poet?"
*   **Specificity of answer:** "Simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct" are all good answers. The flexibility helps a bit, but they still need to pick *one* appropriate word.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Struggling/Basic:** Will often describe the *theme* or *mood* of the poem instead of the writing style (e.g., "The poem is about nature," "It's a sad poem"). They might just copy a line from the poem. They might give a Hindi answer if allowed, or no answer at all. They lack the vocabulary to even attempt it.
    *   **Competent:** Might give a slightly vague answer (e.g., "good writing") or one that's close but not quite right. They might struggle to find the *most* fitting single word. They might provide a short phrase instead of a single word.
    *   **Advanced:** Generally have a better grasp of literary terms and the ability to analyze and apply them. They also have a stronger vocabulary.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*They will almost certainly misunderstand the question or lack the vocabulary to answer it correctly. They might try to describe the poem's content or simply write "good."*

**basic: 5% full marks**
*A very small percentage might, through sheer luck or having recently covered a very simple, direct poem and being able to recall a suitable adjective like "simple." Most will struggle with the concept of "writing style" itself.*

**competent: 40% full marks**
*This group has a decent chance. They understand the question, but the challenge lies in choosing the most accurate and concise single word. Some might give a phrase instead of a word, or a word that's close but not perfectly suited. If the poem is very straightforward (e.g., "The poem is simple and easy to understand"), they might pick up on "simple."*

**advanced: 90% full marks**
*These students are generally adept at identifying literary devices and styles. They have a broader vocabulary and a better understanding of how to analyze text. They would likely pick up on words like "descriptive," "simple," "direct," or "narrative" with relative ease, depending on the poem.*
