This is a great question to gauge comprehension and critical thinking, especially for students from diverse linguistic and economic backgrounds. Here's my breakdown based on my experience:

**Thinking Process for Each Group:**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** The biggest hurdle. Many won't understand "important in real life" or even fully grasp the king's *questions* themselves, let alone the nuance of *why* they are important. They might only pick out "king" and "questions."
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires reasoning *after* recalling the questions. Many won't even recall the questions accurately.
    *   **Specificity:** "Any valid reason" is good, but forming *any* valid reason in English will be tough. They might just say "yes" or "no" without elaboration.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Not understanding the question, inability to form a coherent sentence, simply saying "yes" without a reason, getting confused about what the "king's questions" even were.

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** They will likely understand the question *itself* ("important in real life?") but might struggle with forming a complete, grammatically correct reason. They'll know *what* the king's questions were.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall the questions. The reasoning part will be where some falter due to limited vocabulary or sentence structure. They might give a very simple, one-word reason.
    *   **Specificity:** They might give a valid reason, but it might be very general or lack clarity. E.g., "Yes, because it helps." (Why does it help?).
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Incomplete sentences, vague reasons, grammatical errors, difficulty connecting the *why* to *real life*. They might focus on the *story* rather than applying it to *real life*.

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** Minimal issues. They will understand the question and the king's questions.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can easily recall the questions and will be able to reason out why they are important.
    *   **Specificity:** They will likely provide a clear, concise, and valid reason, even if it's simple.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Perhaps a minor grammatical error, or a reason that is valid but not as profound as an advanced student's. Some might struggle to articulate it *perfectly* but the core idea will be there.

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** No issues.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will effortlessly recall the questions and provide well-articulated reasoning.
    *   **Specificity:** They will provide a strong, clear, and relevant reason, potentially even elaborating slightly or connecting it to a broader life lesson. Their English will be fluent.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Very few, if any. They might provide an excellent answer that is well beyond the "basic valid reason" required.

**Percentage of Students Scoring Full Marks:**

struggling: 0% full marks (They would struggle with both comprehension and articulation)
basic: 10% full marks (A small fraction might manage a very simple, valid reason despite linguistic limitations, perhaps "Yes, because we need to know what to do.")
competent: 70% full marks (Most will get it, providing a clear reason.)
advanced: 95% full marks (Almost all will provide a strong, valid reason.)
