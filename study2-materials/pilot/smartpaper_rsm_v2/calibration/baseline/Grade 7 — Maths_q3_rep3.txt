Okay, let's break this down based on my experience in a Class 7 government school setting.

**Thought Process:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The biggest hurdle is "Find the area of a triangle whose base is 8 cm and height is 6 cm." While "triangle," "base," and "height" might be familiar from geometry lessons where diagrams are used, "find the area" (क्षेत्रफल ज्ञात करें) is key. The numbers are simple, which helps.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is almost entirely recall. If they know the formula, they can do it. If not, they're stuck. There's minimal reasoning beyond substituting values.
*   **Specific Answer:** The formula is very specific: `1/2 * base * height`. There isn't much room for partial recall of the *formula* itself to get partial credit for the *formula*. However, they might remember `base * height` and forget `1/2`.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   Forgetting the `1/2` factor. This is extremely common.
    *   Confusing it with the area of a rectangle/square (`base * height`).
    *   Arithmetic errors (e.g., `8 * 6 = 42` instead of `48`, or `48 / 2 = 22`).
    *   Not writing units or writing incorrect units (cm vs cm²). The rubric specifically says "States or uses the correct formula," so units might not lose them *this* mark, but it's a general weakness.
    *   Difficulty identifying "base" and "height" from a problem description without a diagram (less of an issue here as they are explicitly given).
    *   Struggling to read and understand the English sentence.

**Percentage Breakdown:**

*   **Struggling (35% of total):** These students often have significant literacy issues in English and even struggle with basic arithmetic operations. They likely haven't memorized the formula, or if they have, they might misremember parts of it. Even if they understand "triangle" and "area," the English sentence structure will be a major barrier.
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks** (These would be the few who might have recently revised it, or have a supportive home environment that helps them learn formulas by rote, despite other struggles. Even then, the English is a hurdle.)

*   **Basic (35% of total):** These students can usually perform basic arithmetic but may still struggle with reading English text problems. They might remember *parts* of the formula (like `base × height`) but often forget the `1/2`. They might also make arithmetic errors when multiplying and dividing. They'd likely need some translation assistance or a diagram to fully grasp the question.
    *   **basic: 30% full marks** (A significant portion might get `base × height` but forget `1/2`. Those who get the full formula and execute it correctly would be about a third of this group. The English is still a factor here.)

*   **Competent (20% of total):** These students generally have a better grasp of English and mathematical concepts. They would have memorized common formulas. The primary risk is a careless arithmetic error or a momentary lapse in memory for the `1/2`.
    *   **competent: 80% full marks** (Most will know the formula and execute it correctly. A few might make a silly mistake in calculation or momentarily forget `1/2`, or even misread a number.)

*   **Advanced (10% of total):** These students are confident in both English comprehension and mathematics. They will have the formula memorized, perform the calculation effortlessly, and likely include correct units (even if not explicitly required for *this* mark). They are unlikely to make mistakes on such a straightforward recall question.
    *   **advanced: 95% full marks** (The only potential loss would be a highly unusual lapse in memory or a truly bizarre calculation error, which is rare for this group on a problem like this.)

**Final Breakdown:**

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 30% full marks
competent: 80% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks
