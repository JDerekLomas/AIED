This is a great question that makes me think about my students! Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** The question itself, "contribute to the expansion of British power," would be difficult. They might pick out "Battle of Plassey 1757" but struggle with the "how" and "expansion."
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires a specific connection between the *outcome* of Plassey and *political control*. Struggling students often just recall isolated facts (e.g., "Plassey was a battle," "Clive won") without understanding the causal link.
* **Specificity:** "Establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)" is quite specific. They'd likely struggle to articulate this in English, even if they had a vague idea.
* **Common mistakes:** They might just say "British won," or "British became powerful." They wouldn't connect it to Bengal or the puppet nawab.

**basic: 10% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They might understand "British power" and "expansion," but the phrasing "contribute to" can be tricky. They'd likely rely on keywords they remember from class.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall "British won and got Bengal" or "Mir Jafar became Nawab." They might link *winning* to *power*, but the nuance of "political dominance" or "puppet" might be missed.
* **Specificity:** They might say "British took control of Bengal" which is close but might miss the "political dominance" aspect or the puppet nawab detail. They might struggle to articulate "puppet nawab" precisely.
* **Common mistakes:** Saying "British got control of Bengal" is a common basic answer. They might not use the term "political dominance" or specifically mention Mir Jafar as a *puppet*.

**competent: 50% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They can generally understand the question. They might need a moment, but the core meaning of "how did it help British power grow" is clear.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will likely recall that Plassey led to British control over Bengal. They might remember Mir Jafar. The link between winning the battle and gaining political control (even if indirect initially) should be clear to them.
* **Specificity:** They have a good chance of explaining that the victory gave the British control/dominance over Bengal and might even mention Mir Jafar as a puppet. They are better at forming coherent sentences in English.
* **Common mistakes:** Some might just say "British controlled Bengal" without explicitly mentioning "political dominance" or "puppet." They might struggle with the most precise English phrasing, but the core idea should be there.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issue here. They will understand the question perfectly.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They have a strong grasp of the historical context. They can connect the military victory to the immediate political consequences and the subsequent increase in British influence and resources.
* **Specificity:** They will very likely articulate that the victory established British political dominance over Bengal, often mentioning the installation of Mir Jafar as a puppet ruler and the resulting control over resources and administration. They can express this clearly and concisely in English.
* **Common mistakes:** Very few, perhaps a tiny percentage might forget a key term like "puppet" or use slightly less formal language, but the core understanding of political dominance over Bengal will be present.
