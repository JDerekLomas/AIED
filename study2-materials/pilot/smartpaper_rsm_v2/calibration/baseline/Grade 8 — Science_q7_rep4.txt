Here's my breakdown of expected full marks for this question, considering my students and the scoring rubric:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Collected waste," "pit," "notice any change," "beneficial for soil health" – these phrases would be difficult to fully comprehend, let alone process. They might pick up a few keywords but miss the core meaning.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** While the concept of composting is something we might have covered, applying it to a scenario and reasoning out the "why" and "if beneficial" is beyond their current reasoning skills in English. They might recall "kharab ho jata hai" (it gets spoiled) but not the scientific explanation.
* **Specificity:** The rubric requires "significant changes" and then reasons and evaluation. They wouldn't be able to articulate this in a coherent way.
* **Common mistakes:** Misunderstanding the question entirely, providing a one-word answer, focusing on an irrelevant detail, or simply leaving it blank due to lack of comprehension and confidence.

**basic: 10% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** Some might grasp the general idea of "waste in a pit" and "change." They might understand "beneficial" if they've heard it in class. However, explaining "why" and "how" in English is still a challenge.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They might recall that plant waste "rots" or "becomes fertilizer" if we've discussed it. But connecting *all* parts of the question (change, reason, benefit) specifically and accurately would be tough.
* **Specificity:** They might say "yes, it will change" and "it's good for soil," but the "reasons" would likely be very vague or partially correct, not fully satisfying the rubric for "significant changes" and detailed reasons.
* **Common mistakes:** Providing a superficial answer, incomplete reasoning, grammatical errors that obscure meaning, or missing one of the three components (change, reason, benefit).

**competent: 50% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They would likely understand the question well enough to attempt it. Some might need to re-read or ask for clarification on a specific word.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would recall composting and decomposition. They could likely reason out that the waste will break down and that it's good for the soil.
* **Specificity:** They would probably state that the waste will decompose, become smaller, darker, and turn into manure/compost. They would also likely state it's beneficial because it adds nutrients or improves soil quality. The challenge would be in articulating *all* the nuances to fully satisfy "significant changes" and detailed reasons, especially regarding microbial action.
* **Common mistakes:** Not explicitly mentioning "decomposition" or "microorganisms," or perhaps providing slightly less detailed reasons for the benefit to soil health. They might struggle with sentence structure and vocabulary to express their full understanding.

**advanced: 90% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They would easily comprehend the question.
* **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would recall the entire process of decomposition, including the role of microorganisms. They could reason out the benefits comprehensively.
* **Specificity:** They would articulate that the gardener would notice the waste decomposing, reducing in volume, changing color and texture, eventually forming compost/humus. They would explain that this is due to microbial action (bacteria, fungi) and that it is highly beneficial for soil health by adding nutrients, improving soil structure, water retention, and aeration.
* **Common mistakes:** Perhaps missing one minor detail in their explanation or having a few grammatical errors that don't detract from the core scientific understanding. They might sometimes forget to explicitly state "significant changes" as part of their answer, assuming it's implied by their detailed explanation.
