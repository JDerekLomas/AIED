Here's my breakdown based on my experience:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** Even if they could read the sentence, identifying an "adjective phrase" is a jump in complexity. Many struggling students would probably just point to "bird" or "nest" as important words, or even "balcony." They likely haven't grasped the concept of a phrase, let alone distinguishing an adjective phrase. Their focus is often on individual word meaning.

**basic: 5% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** A few students at this level might recall what an adjective is (a describing word), and might identify "tiny." However, the "phrase" part is the killer. They're unlikely to understand that "tiny bird" *could* be considered a noun phrase modified by an adjective, or that the question is specifically looking for the adjectival *phrase* rather than just the adjective. If they only identify "tiny," they won't get full marks as per the rubric's specific request for an *adjective phrase*. It's a common mistake to just pick the adjective.

**competent: 20% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** These students *should* be able to identify "tiny" as the adjective. However, the question asks for an "adjective phrase." The sentence *doesn't actually contain an adjective phrase*. "Tiny" is a single adjective. If the sentence was "A **very tiny** bird...", then "very tiny" would be an adjective phrase. Given the sentence as it is, there isn't an adjective phrase. This is a trick question or a poorly formed one, which would confuse even competent students. They would likely identify "tiny" and then struggle with the "phrase" part, perhaps guessing "tiny bird" (which is a noun phrase) or just writing "tiny." Only a very sharp student might correctly state "there is no adjective phrase" or, failing that, might just write "tiny" hoping it's what's intended. The rubric says "correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This implies the question intends to ask for the adjective, not an adjective phrase, despite the wording. If we strictly follow the question "adjective phrase," the answer is "none." If we follow the rubric's implied intention (identify the adjective), then more would score. Given the discrepancy, and my students' likely struggle with the "phrase" part even if they know "tiny," I'm keeping this low.

**advanced: 50% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** These students would definitely identify "tiny" as the adjective. The confusion here lies in the "phrase" aspect. An advanced student might recognize that "tiny" is a single adjective and not a phrase. They might even try to explain why there isn't an adjective phrase in the sentence. If the rubric strictly adheres to "identifies 'tiny' as an adjective" (which would be correct for the adjective itself), then more would score. But if the question strictly demands an "adjective *phrase*", then they might get stuck because there isn't one, leading to confusion or an incorrect guess like "tiny bird." I'm assuming some will correctly identify "tiny" and, despite the "phrase" part, the teacher might accept it, or they might recognize the issue with the question itself. The prompt is "Identify the adjective phrase," and the rubric "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This conflict makes it tricky. If the rubric means *just* "tiny", then more would get it. If they have to argue that "tiny" is an adjective but not a phrase, they might not get full marks. I'm going with 50% assuming some will just pick "tiny" and it will be accepted, or they will be sophisticated enough to explain the lack of a phrase.
