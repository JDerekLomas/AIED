This is a classic question that often reveals the true language proficiency of students, beyond just rote memorization. Given the demographics and challenges, my expectations would be as follows:

struggling: 5% full marks
basic: 30% full marks
competent: 70% full marks
advanced: 95% full marks

**Reasoning:**

*   **Struggling (35% of class, often Hindi-medium, very limited English):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** Many cannot *read* the prompt effectively without significant help. Even if they understand "My favourite hobby," constructing sentences beyond "My hobby is..." would be a huge challenge.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires a bit of both. They need to recall vocabulary for hobbies and action verbs, but also reason about *when* and *why*. This is where they stumble.
    *   **Specificity:** The requirement for "when you do it" and "why you enjoy it" adds complexity. They might write "My hobby is playing. I like it." but struggle to expand.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Single-word answers, fragmented sentences, heavy L1 interference, incorrect verb forms, inability to connect ideas. Some might copy from a previously taught paragraph if available, but constructing their *own* is very difficult.
    *   *Why 5%?* A very small number, perhaps those who have received more individual attention or have some basic exposure outside of school, might manage a very simple but complete paragraph, e.g., "My favourite hobby is drawing. I draw in the evening. I like it because it is fun." This would barely scrape a full mark, but it fulfills the criteria.

*   **Basic (35% of class, some understanding, can form simple sentences):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** They can likely read and understand the prompt. They know basic vocabulary.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall hobbies and simple reasons. Constructing 4-5 coherent sentences is their main hurdle.
    *   **Specificity:** They might mention the hobby and "why" (e.g., "I like it"), but struggle with "when" or making the "why" more descriptive. They often fall short of 4-5 sentences or repeat ideas.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Short, choppy sentences; limited vocabulary for describing enjoyment; sometimes omitting one of the required elements; grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, tenses).
    *   *Why 30%?* A good portion of these students would manage to write a paragraph like "My favourite hobby is playing cricket. I play with my friends. We play after school. I enjoy it because it is fun and I like to run." This meets the criteria even if simple. The other 70% in this group might miss one element or write too few sentences.

*   **Competent (20% of class, can communicate reasonably well, understand grammar):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** Not a significant barrier. They understand the prompt easily.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can articulate their thoughts clearly.
    *   **Specificity:** They will comfortably include all three elements and expand on them slightly.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Minor grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, but generally clear communication.
    *   *Why 70%?* Most of these students will write a good paragraph that meets all criteria. Some might still make a couple of minor errors that don't detract from the completeness of the answer, or might struggle to make the "why" sufficiently distinct from "what".

*   **Advanced (10% of class, good fluency, strong grasp of grammar):**
    *   **Language Barrier:** No barrier.
    *   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can express complex ideas with good vocabulary.
    *   **Specificity:** They will easily fulfill all requirements, often with more descriptive language and varied sentence structures.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Very few, if any, and usually minor stylistic issues rather than grammatical errors or incomplete information.
    *   *Why 95%?* These students are typically well-prepared for such tasks. The only reason for a tiny percentage not scoring full marks might be a momentary lapse, handwriting issues, or perhaps misinterpreting a nuanced aspect of the "why" if they try to be too creative.
