This is a classic recall question for Class 6 Social Science. Here's my assessment based on my experience:

**struggling: 10% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Many struggling students will not be able to read and comprehend "major mountain ranges located in India." They might pick out "mountain" and "India" but struggle with "ranges."
* **Recall:** Even if they understand the question, their general knowledge recall for specific geographical features might be weak due to less exposure at home or less consistent study habits.
* **Common mistakes:** They might write "Mount Everest" (a peak, not a range, and not entirely in India), or just "mountain," or even random places they've heard of. Some might not write anything at all due to fear of being wrong or not understanding.

**basic: 40% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** They will likely understand "mountain ranges" and "India," even if it takes a moment. They might struggle with "major" but will focus on "mountain ranges."
* **Recall:** Many in this group will have memorized "Himalayas" as a key feature of India. Some might also recall "Aravalli" or "Vindhya" if those were emphasized more recently in class. The question only asks for *one* correct range for full marks, which significantly increases their chances.
* **Common mistakes:** They might only write one, even if they know two. They might misspell a bit, but it would be recognizable. Some might still struggle to differentiate between a range and a peak.

**competent: 80% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issue here. They will read and understand the question quickly.
* **Recall:** They will almost certainly know "Himalayas." Many will also know at least one other, like "Aravalli," "Vindhya," or "Western Ghats." They are more likely to have a good mental map of India's physical features.
* **Common mistakes:** Might occasionally forget a second one, or misspell slightly, but will definitely get at least one correct.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
* **Language barrier:** No issue at all.
* **Recall:** They will not only know "Himalayas" but easily recall several others (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats). They likely have a strong grasp of geography concepts and recall specific names with ease.
* **Common mistakes:** The only reason for not getting full marks would be a very rare slip of mind or perhaps writing too many and one being incorrect (though unlikely for this group). They understand the instruction to "Name any two" and will likely provide two correct answers confidently.
