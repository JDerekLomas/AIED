This is a great question that makes me think about my students in Class 8. Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 0-5% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they've heard "Battle of Plassey" and "Bengal," understanding "contribute to the expansion of British power" and formulating an answer in English will be extremely difficult. They might only pick out "Battle of Plassey" and "1757" and write something very generic or irrelevant.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires recall of a specific consequence. While we discuss it, their recall for specific factual points in English is weak.
*   **Specificity:** "Establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)" is quite specific. They're unlikely to articulate this with the required precision.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Misunderstanding the question, writing about something else entirely, or just copying keywords without context.

**basic: 10-15% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Some will understand "Battle of Plassey" and "British power," and perhaps "expansion." They might recall that the British *won* and *became powerful* in Bengal.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall "Mir Jafar" and "puppet nawab" if taught explicitly and repeatedly, but connecting it clearly to "political dominance" might be a stretch.
*   **Specificity:** They might say "British won and controlled Bengal" or "Mir Jafar became their puppet." This is close, but articulating "political dominance" might still be hard. Many would miss the "political" aspect and just say "controlled."
*   **Common Mistakes:** Not being specific enough, or using very simple, broken English that doesn't fully convey the idea of political control.

**competent: 50-60% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Most would be able to read and understand the question reasonably well, though some might still struggle with "contribute to the expansion."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They are more likely to recall the specific consequence of Mir Jafar becoming a puppet ruler and the British gaining control over Bengal. They've likely internalized this as a key turning point.
*   **Specificity:** They would likely use terms like "control," "dominant," "puppet ruler," or "influence" in Bengal. They might not use the exact phrase "political dominance," but their answer would convey the essence.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Some might just say "British gained control of Bengal" without mentioning Mir Jafar, which might be borderline for full marks depending on strictness.

**advanced: 85-95% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here. They will understand the question fully.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They have strong recall of key historical events and their significance. They would have no trouble remembering the outcome of Plassey.
*   **Specificity:** They would likely articulate clearly that the victory led to the British gaining *political control* or *dominance* over Bengal by installing a puppet ruler like Mir Jafar, thus expanding their power. They might even use more sophisticated vocabulary.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very few, perhaps a minor grammatical error, but the core content would be accurate and specific.
