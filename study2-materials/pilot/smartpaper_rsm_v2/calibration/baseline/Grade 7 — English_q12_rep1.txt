This is a very common type of transformation taught in Class 7, but given the specific context of an Indian government school with students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the success rate will vary significantly across the ability groups.

Let's break it down:

*   **Language barriers:** Many struggling students will struggle to even understand the meaning of "wind" or "blew" or "leaves" in English, let alone the grammatical concept. The instruction "Change... from Active Voice to Passive Voice" will be completely alien to them. Even some basic students might struggle with reading comprehension.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires *both* recall of the rules for converting active to passive voice (identifying subject, verb, object, changing verb form, using 'by', etc.) *and* reasoning to apply those rules correctly to a new sentence. It's not just rote memorization of a definition.
*   **Specificity of answer:** The answer is very specific. "The leaves were blown away by the wind." Any significant deviation in verb form, auxiliary verb, or word order will mean it's incorrect.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   **Incorrect verb form:** "blown" is often a challenge (they might use "blowed" or simply "blow").
    *   **Missing auxiliary verb:** Forgetting "were" (e.g., "The leaves blown away by the wind").
    *   **Incorrect auxiliary verb:** Using "is" or "are" instead of "were" (confusion with present tense).
    *   **Word order issues:** Mixing up "by the wind" placement.
    *   **Lack of 'by':** Omitting "by the wind" completely.
    *   **Simply rewriting the sentence:** Not understanding the task.
    *   **Translating literally from Hindi:** This often leads to awkward or incorrect English structures.

Here's my estimation:

*   **Struggling (35%):** 0% full marks. They would likely not understand the question or the sentence itself. If they tried, it would be a random guess.
*   **Basic (35%):** 10% full marks. Some might have a vague idea of "active-passive" but struggle with the past tense verb form ("blown") or the correct auxiliary verb ("were"). Those who recall a similar example or have practiced this specific type of past tense transformation might get it.
*   **Competent (20%):** 60% full marks. These students have a better grasp of grammar and vocabulary. They've likely practiced active/passive voice extensively. Their main challenges might be minor errors like omitting "by the wind" or a temporary lapse in recalling "blown."
*   **Advanced (10%):** 90% full marks. These students would find this relatively straightforward. They understand the mechanics of voice change and have a stronger vocabulary and grasp of irregular verbs. A small percentage might make a careless error.

**Summary:**

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 10% full marks
competent: 60% full marks
advanced: 90% full marks
