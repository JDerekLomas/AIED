Here's my breakdown based on my experience:

**Thinking Process:**

*   **Language Barrier:** The equation itself `y + 9 = 4` is fairly universal in its mathematical symbols. The question "Find the value of y in the equation:" is straightforward English, but for many struggling students, even this can be a hurdle. I'd likely rephrase it on the board in Hindi as well: "इस समीकरण में 'y' का मान ज्ञात करें।" However, for a written test item, the English stands. This primarily impacts the *struggling* group.

*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This problem primarily requires *reasoning* based on understanding the inverse operation (subtraction to undo addition). It's not a direct recall of a fact like "2+2=4". Students need to understand the concept of isolating the variable.

*   **Specificity of Answer:** The answer `y = -5` is very specific. No partial understanding will yield the correct final result.

*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Ignoring negatives:** This is the *biggest* one. Many students, especially struggling and basic, will try to make the answer positive. They'll do `9 - 4 = 5` and incorrectly write `y = 5`.
    *   **Adding instead of subtracting:** Some might simply add `9 + 4 = 13`.
    *   **Misplacing the constant:** They might do `4 - 9`, but then be unsure how to handle the negative, or just write `5`.
    *   **Procedural errors:** Not knowing to subtract 9 from *both sides*. They might just write `y = 4 - 9` and then get stuck or make the positive mistake.

**Percentage Breakdown:**

*   **Struggling (35%):**
    *   Language: Some might understand "find y" but get lost in the arithmetic.
    *   Concepts: The concept of inverse operations to isolate a variable might be weak.
    *   Negatives: Very high chance of ignoring the negative sign if they even attempt subtraction.
    *   *My Estimate:* Most will get it wrong due to either adding, subtracting incorrectly, or, most commonly, giving `y = 5`. Maybe 1-2 students out of this 35% might stumble upon the correct answer, perhaps having seen it recently in a solved example.
    *   **struggling: 5% full marks**

*   **Basic (35%):**
    *   Language: Generally understand "find y".
    *   Concepts: They know they need to "move the 9" but might struggle with the mechanics and especially the negative sign.
    *   Negatives: A significant portion will still make the mistake of `9 - 4 = 5`, or be confused by `4 - 9` and write `5`. Some will get it if they've practiced enough with negative answers.
    *   *My Estimate:* About half will likely make the positive sign error. Another chunk might struggle with the entire process. A good portion will get it right if they've been attentive to integer rules.
    *   **basic: 40% full marks**

*   **Competent (20%):**
    *   Language: No issue.
    *   Concepts: They understand inverse operations and variable isolation.
    *   Negatives: Most will correctly handle the negative integer arithmetic. They might make a careless error, but the conceptual understanding is there.
    *   *My Estimate:* A very high percentage will get this right. The few who miss it will be due to a genuine arithmetic error (e.g., `4-9` but writing `-6` by mistake), not a conceptual one.
    *   **competent: 90% full marks**

*   **Advanced (10%):**
    *   Language: No issue.
    *   Concepts: This is a very basic problem for them.
    *   Negatives: They will correctly solve it with ease.
    *   *My Estimate:* Almost all will get this correct. A truly rare slip might occur, but it's highly unlikely.
    *   **advanced: 100% full marks**
