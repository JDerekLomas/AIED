Here's my breakdown of how my Class 6 English students would perform on this item, given their background and common challenges:

**struggling: 10% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** Many of these students struggle with basic word recognition, let alone understanding the nuances of 'some' vs. 'any'. They might just guess or choose the first word they see. Even if they know 'apples' and 'basket', the grammatical rule is likely beyond them. Some might get it right by sheer chance or if they've heard the phrase "some apples" many times without understanding why.

**basic: 40% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** These students have a foundational understanding but often make errors with articles, prepositions, and quantifier usage. Some might recall hearing "some apples" in similar contexts or through rote learning if it was explicitly taught. However, many would still struggle to differentiate between 'some' and 'any' beyond very simple positive vs. negative sentences. They might try to reason, but their grammatical foundation for this specific rule isn't strong enough yet.

**competent: 80% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** These students would likely have been introduced to the 'some' vs. 'any' rule and practiced it to some extent. They can read the sentence comfortably and understand its meaning. While they might still make occasional errors in more complex sentences, this straightforward positive statement ("There are...") makes it easier for them to apply the rule for 'some'.

**advanced: 100% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** Students in this category would have a solid grasp of basic English grammar, including quantifiers. They would immediately recognize that 'some' is used in affirmative sentences like this one, while 'any' is typically used in questions or negative sentences. This is a relatively simple application of a core grammatical rule for them.
