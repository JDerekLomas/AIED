This is a very common type of question in Class 8, but the introduction of negative numbers as a solution often trips up students, especially those who struggle or are from a basic understanding background. The English wording is simple enough that most should be able to grasp the mathematical operation despite language barriers.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
* **Reasoning:** These students often struggle with the concept of "moving" a number to the other side and changing its sign. They might also forget the rules for subtraction when the subtrahend is larger than the minuend (4 - 9). Many might get y = 13 (adding 9 to 4) or even try to rearrange it as 9 - 4 = 5, forgetting the y. The introduction of negative numbers is a major hurdle for them.

**basic:** 30% full marks
* **Reasoning:** Students at this level generally understand the concept of isolating 'y'. They know to subtract 9 from both sides. However, 4 - 9 is still a point of error. Some might get y = 5 (doing 9-4) and forget the negative sign, or they might make a calculation error. They understand the *procedure* but the arithmetic with negative numbers is a common stumbling block.

**competent:** 80% full marks
* **Reasoning:** These students have a solid grasp of basic algebraic manipulation and operations with integers. They will correctly move the 9 to the other side and understand that 4 - 9 results in -5. They might take a bit of time, but they should get it right.

**advanced:** 100% full marks
* **Reasoning:** This question is straightforward for advanced students. They will solve it quickly and accurately, understanding all the concepts involved.
