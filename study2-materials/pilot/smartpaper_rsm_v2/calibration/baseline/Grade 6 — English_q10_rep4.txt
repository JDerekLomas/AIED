This is a classic 'some/any' distinction that often trips up students, especially those from Hindi-medium backgrounds where a direct translation might not exist or be commonly used in the same way.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling: 5% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Many wouldn't be able to read and comprehend the sentence fully. "There are... apples in the basket" might be understood partially, but "some/any" will be a complete unknown or a guess.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires recall of a specific grammatical rule, which they likely haven't explicitly learned or practiced enough to internalize.
*   **Common mistakes:** They might pick one randomly, or stick to a word they've heard more often without understanding the context.

**basic: 20% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They might be able to read the words, but the subtle difference between 'some' and 'any' for affirmative sentences versus questions/negatives will be a challenge.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** Some might recall hearing 'some apples' in a similar context (e.g., "I have some apples"), but might not know the rule that 'any' is for questions or negatives.
*   **Common mistakes:** Many will make a guess, or mistakenly apply 'any' if they've heard it used in questions (e.g., "Do you have any apples?").

**competent: 70% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They can read and understand the sentence.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would likely have encountered this rule or similar examples. They might not be able to articulate the rule perfectly but would 'feel' that 'some' sounds correct for an affirmative statement.
*   **Common mistakes:** A few might still get confused if they've only recently learned the rule, or if they overthink it. Some might mix up the rule for questions or negatives.

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issues here.
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** They would definitely know the rule for 'some' in affirmative sentences and 'any' in questions/negatives. This would be a straightforward application of a known grammatical concept.
*   **Common mistakes:** A rare careless error is possible, but highly unlikely for this specific item.
