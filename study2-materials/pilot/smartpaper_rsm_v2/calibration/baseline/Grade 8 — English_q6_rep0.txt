Here's my estimation based on the scenario:

struggling: 0% full marks
basic: 5% full marks
competent: 50% full marks
advanced: 90% full marks

**Reasoning:**

*   **Language Barriers:** The "struggling" and "basic" groups would face significant challenges not just in recalling the definition but even comprehending the question itself, let alone formulating a precise English answer. Many might understand the concept if explained in Hindi but struggle to articulate it in English.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question primarily requires recall. While they might have encountered fables (like Panchatantra stories), explicitly knowing and being able to define the *term* "fable" in English is a different skill.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric is quite specific: "short story," "animals as characters," and "imparts a moral lesson." This level of detail makes it harder for students with limited vocabulary and sentence construction skills.
*   **Common Mistakes:**
    *   **Struggling:** Would likely leave it blank or write something completely unrelated.
    *   **Basic:** Might vaguely define it as "a story with animals" or "a story with a lesson," but often miss one or more key components (e.g., "short," "animals as *characters*," or the explicit "moral lesson" part). They might confuse it with a general story.
    *   **Competent:** A good portion would get "story with animals and a lesson," but some might miss "short" or struggle to phrase "imparts a moral lesson" precisely. They might say "teaches a lesson" which is close but not as formal.
    *   **Advanced:** These students are more likely to have a robust vocabulary and better recall of literary terms. They would have encountered such definitions in previous grades or through independent reading. They might occasionally miss "short" but generally hit all other points.
