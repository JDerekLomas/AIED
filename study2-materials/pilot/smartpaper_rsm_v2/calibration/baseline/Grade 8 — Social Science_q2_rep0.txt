As an experienced teacher in an Indian government school, Class 8 Social Science, I've taught this topic many times. Here's my assessment of how my students would perform on this question, considering their background and common challenges:

The question asks for *one key feature* of Harappan urban planning. This is a recall-based question. The answer needs to be specific, but the rubric allows for several valid points.

**Language Barriers:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they know the answer in Hindi, translating it into coherent English can be tough. Many might understand "urban planning" but struggle with "key feature" or expressing the details clearly.

**Recall vs. Reasoning:** It's pure recall. If they remember it, great. If not, they can't deduce it.

**Specificity:** The rubric is quite specific (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town). Vague answers like "they had good cities" wouldn't score.

**Common Mistakes:**
*   **Vague answers:** "They had good buildings."
*   **Incomplete answers:** "They had drains" instead of "advanced drainage system."
*   **Mixing up civilizations:** Attributing features of other ancient civilizations (e.g., Roman architecture) to Harappan.
*   **English expression:** Knowing the concept but failing to articulate it in understandable English due to limited vocabulary or sentence structure.
*   **Focusing on non-urban planning aspects:** Describing pottery, seals, or agriculture instead of city structure.

Here's my breakdown:

*   **struggling: 5% full marks**
    *   Many will simply not understand the question or struggle too much with the English to formulate any answer.
    *   A very small percentage might have a direct recall of one simple point like "baked bricks" and manage to write it down.
    *   They might offer a vague or incorrect answer.
*   **basic: 25% full marks**
    *   They might recall one feature in Hindi but struggle to translate it accurately into English.
    *   Some might manage to get "good drainage" or "straight roads" but miss the "advanced" or "grid layout" specificity.
    *   They often get partial credit, but full marks for a specific and well-articulated feature will be a challenge.
*   **competent: 70% full marks**
    *   These students generally grasp the concepts and have a better ability to recall and express them in English.
    *   They are more likely to remember terms like "grid pattern" or "advanced drainage system" or "citadel and lower town."
    *   They might still make minor grammatical errors, but the core concept will be clear enough for full marks.
*   **advanced: 95% full marks**
    *   These students typically have strong recall and better English proficiency.
    *   They will confidently state one of the key features, often using appropriate vocabulary.
    *   They might even elaborate slightly, demonstrating a deeper understanding, but the question only asks for one. The 5% miss might be due to a momentary lapse of memory or a very rare misinterpretation.
