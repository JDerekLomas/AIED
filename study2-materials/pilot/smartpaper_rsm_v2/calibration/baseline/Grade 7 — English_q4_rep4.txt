Okay, this is a very familiar scenario. Let's break down how my Class 7 English students would likely perform on this question.

The question requires a few things:
1.  **Understanding the question itself:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?" This needs comprehension of "important in real life."
2.  **Recalling the King's Questions:** The rubric specifies what the king's questions *were* (right time, right thing, right people). While the prompt doesn't ask them to list them, their reasoning for *why* they are important will implicitly or explicitly connect to these.
3.  **Formulating a "yes" or "no" answer:** Simple enough.
4.  **Providing *one valid reason*:** This is the core of the reasoning task.

Here's my estimation, considering the challenges:

**struggling: 0% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Many won't understand "important in real life" or even the full question structure. They might pick up "king's questions" and give a random answer.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They struggle with basic recall from the passage, let alone higher-order reasoning. They might remember *that* the king asked questions but not *what* they were or *why* they mattered.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Giving unrelated answers, simply stating "yes" without a reason, or getting stuck and writing nothing. They might just parrot a line from the text if they can locate one, but it's unlikely to be a valid *reason* for importance.

**basic: 10% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Some will understand the question, especially if I paraphrase it or connect it to their daily lives (e.g., "Kya yeh prashan hamari zindagi mein zaroori hain?").
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall *that* the questions were about "right time, right person, right work" if prompted or if it was recently reviewed. The jump to *why* it's important in *real life* is still a significant hurdle. They often struggle to articulate abstract ideas.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might say "yes, because the king wanted to know," which shows recall but not real-life importance. Or they might give a very simplistic reason like "so we don't make mistakes," which *could* be valid but often lacks clarity. The 10% would be those who manage a simple, valid reason like "to do things correctly" or "to make good decisions."

**competent: 60% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** Most will understand the question. They can decode it and understand what is being asked.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can recall the questions. They can connect the king's search for answers to the idea of making good choices in life. They understand that knowing the right time/person/thing leads to success or avoids problems.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Some might struggle to phrase their reason clearly or might give a reason that is slightly vague, but the core idea of "importance in real life" will be present. For example, "Yes, because it helps us do our work well" or "Yes, because if we know these things, we will be successful."

**advanced: 95% full marks**
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue here.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They not only recall the questions but immediately grasp the underlying philosophical importance. They can articulate a clear, concise, and valid reason. They understand that these questions are universally applicable for effective living.
*   **Common Mistakes:** The only reason for not scoring 100% would be a very rare instance of misinterpretation or a careless answer. They would likely give reasons like, "Yes, because knowing the right time, person, and action helps us make wise decisions and achieve success in any endeavor," or "These questions guide us to live a purposeful and effective life by avoiding mistakes and focusing on what truly matters."
