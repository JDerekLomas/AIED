Namaste bacchon! Kaise ho sab? Aaj hum Rajasthan ke bare mein aur acchi tarah se janenge. Hum dekhenge ki prakriti ne Rajasthan ko kya-kya anmol cheezein di hain, jinhe hum natural resources (prakritik sansadhan) kehte hain.

**Natural Resources in Rajasthan and their influence:**

Two natural resources found in Rajasthan are:

1.  **Water** (Jal/Paani)
2.  **Marble** (Sangmarmar)

Let's talk about how **Water** influences the lives of people in Rajasthan.

Rajasthan is mostly a desert (registan) area, so water is very, very important there.

*   **For Drinking and Daily Needs:** Logon ko peene ke liye aur ghar ke kaam jaise nahane, kapde dhone ke liye paani chahiye. Jab paani kam hota hai, toh unhe bahut door se paani laana padta hai, jismein bahut mehnat aur samay lagta hai.
*   **For Farming (Kheti):** Rajasthan mein kheti karne ke liye bhi paani ki zaroorat hoti hai. Jahan paani milta hai, wahan log bajra, gehun jaisi fasalein ugaate hain. Agar paani na ho toh kheti karna mushkil ho jaata hai aur logon ko khaane ki kami ho sakti hai.
*   **For Animals (Pashu):** Rajasthan mein log bahut saare jaanwar jaise oont, bakriyan rakhte hain. In jaanwaron ko bhi jeene ke liye paani chahiye. Paani ki kami se jaanwaron ko bhi mushkil hoti hai.
*   **Livelihood (Roji-roti):** Paani ki wajah se hi logon ki roji-roti chalti hai. Agar paani kam ho toh log gaon chhodkar shehron mein kaam dhoondhne jaate hain. Indira Gandhi Canal jaisi naharein (canals) Rajasthan ke kai hisson mein paani laakar logon ki zindagi badal rahi hain.

**Scoring Rubric Analysis for this specific question:**

*   **Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy).** (Max score: 1)
*   **Explains how one of them influences the lives of the people there.** (This part carries more weight in understanding if the student actually grasps the concept, but the rubric only specifies 'mentions two resources' for the 1 mark.)

Given the rubric is very simple (just mentioning two resources for 1 mark), it's more about recall. However, my internal assessment of their understanding goes beyond just listing.

**Common mistakes my students make:**

*   **Language Barrier:** Many struggle to read the English question correctly. "Natural resources" might be understood as "natural things." "Influences" is a difficult word.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might remember "Marble" but not understand how it influences lives beyond "making buildings."
*   **Specificity:** They might just say "things found in Rajasthan" without listing specific natural resources.
*   **Overgeneralization:** They might mention "farming" but not link it directly to "water" in Rajasthan's context.

Based on my experience:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   These students might be able to pick out "Rajasthan" and "natural," but struggle with "resources" and "influences."
*   They might list two general things like "animals" and "trees" or nothing at all.
*   Even if they list two resources, they'll struggle immensely to explain the influence in English. The rubric only asks for listing two resources for the mark, which increases their chances slightly. They might *accidentally* list two.

**basic:** 30% full marks
*   Many will understand "natural resources" if taught in Hindi/local language.
*   They might recall "paani" and "sangmarmar" or "ret" (sand).
*   The challenge for them will be writing the answer in English. They might write *two* correct resources, fulfilling the simple rubric.

**competent:** 75% full marks
*   They will understand the question well.
*   They can recall multiple natural resources.
*   They will be able to write down two correct resources easily.
*   The explanation part (even if not strictly scored by the provided rubric) would be decent, linking resources like water to farming, daily life, etc.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   They will understand the question perfectly.
