Okay, let's break this down based on my experience in a government school, Class 7 English, with the described student profile.

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."
*   **King's Questions (from the passage, implicit knowledge):**
    1.  What is the right time to begin everything?
    2.  Who are the right people to listen to?
    3.  What is the most important thing to do?
*   **Required Answer:** A simple "Yes" or "No" (though "Yes" is more natural and aligns with the story's theme) followed by *any valid reason*.
*   **Key Challenge:** The question requires *reasoning* and *connecting* the story's themes to real life, not just recall. It also requires expressing that reason in English.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students need to understand "important in real life" and formulate a simple English sentence for the reason.
*   **Specificity:** "Any valid reason" is quite open, which helps.

**Common Mistakes Students Might Make:**

*   **Misunderstanding "important in real life":** They might think it's asking if the king himself is important.
*   **Stating a reason that isn't connected:** They might just say something random they recall from the story, not a reason *why* the questions are important.
*   **Inability to formulate a reason in English:** Even if they understand the concept, they might struggle with the vocabulary and sentence structure.
*   **Simply recalling the questions:** Some might just list the king's questions instead of giving a reason for their importance.
*   **Grammar/Spelling issues:** While the rubric focuses on validity of reason, poor language might obscure the intended meaning.

Here's my percentage breakdown:

**struggling: 0-5% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** Most in this group would struggle to even fully comprehend the question, let alone formulate a reasoned answer in English. They might just write "yes" or "no" without a reason, or write something completely irrelevant in Hindi or broken English. Some might remember the king wanted answers but won't connect it to "real life importance." A very tiny fraction might grasp "important" and give a single, very simple, valid word (e.g., "for good life") if prompted heavily.

**basic: 15-20% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** This group might understand "important in real life" with some effort. They might struggle to articulate a *reason* clearly in English. They might say "yes" and then give a very simplistic reason like "to do work," "to live well," or "to not make mistake." Their English would be grammatically shaky, but the core idea might be discernible. They would likely grasp the *idea* but falter on expression.

**competent: 60-70% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** Many in this group would understand the question well. They would likely give a "yes" and provide a reason such as "to make right decisions," "to be successful," "to avoid problems," or "to know what to do." Their English might still have some minor errors, but the reason would be clear and directly linked to the importance of the questions. They've made the leap from story to real-life application.

**advanced: 90-100% full marks**
*   **Reasoning:** Students in this group would not only understand the question but also articulate a clear, coherent, and well-reasoned answer. They might say something like, "Yes, because knowing the right time, people, and task helps us make better choices and leads to a more organized and successful life." Their English would be largely correct and fluent. They connect the abstract ideas to practical application effortlessly.
