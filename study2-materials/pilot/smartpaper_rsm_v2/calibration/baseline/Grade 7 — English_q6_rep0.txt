This is a challenging question for most of my Class 7 students, especially given their background and English proficiency levels.

Here's my breakdown:

*   **Language barriers:** "Describes the poet's writing style" itself can be a complex phrase. "Writing style" is an abstract concept that many will struggle to grasp, let alone articulate in English. They might understand "what the poet writes about" (theme/topic) better than "how the poet writes."
*   **Recall vs. reasoning:** This requires reasoning and analytical skills, not just recall. They need to have read the poem, understood it, and then be able to identify *how* it's written. Many struggle with comprehension first.
*   **Specificity of answer:** While the rubric says "a suitable and relevant word," coming up with even one such word (like "simple," "descriptive") requires a level of vocabulary and analytical thinking that most lack. They might say "good" or "nice," which isn't specific enough.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Misunderstanding "writing style" altogether.
    *   Confusing style with theme/content.
    *   Lack of vocabulary to express the style.
    *   Providing a generic, unspecific answer.
    *   Not answering at all due to lack of understanding.

Here's my estimation for full marks:

basic: 5% full marks
competent: 30% full marks
advanced: 60% full marks
