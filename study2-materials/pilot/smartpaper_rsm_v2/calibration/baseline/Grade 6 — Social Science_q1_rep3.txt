Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with my Class 6 students in a government school.

The question is about recalling factual information (names of mountain ranges). It doesn't require complex reasoning. However, the language barrier is a significant hurdle. Even if they know the Hindi names, associating them with the English terms "mountain ranges" can be tough for some. "Pahar ki shrinkhla" might be a more familiar term.

Common mistakes:
*   Not understanding "mountain ranges" itself.
*   Confusing mountains with plateaus or rivers.
*   Knowing the names in Hindi but not being able to write or recall them in English.
*   Spelling mistakes that might make it hard to recognize.
*   Only remembering "Himalaya" and struggling for a second one.

Here's my breakdown:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   Even for one correct answer, this group struggles significantly with reading the English question. They might recognize "India" and "mountain" (pahar), but "ranges" might be lost. If they happen to just remember "Himalayas" from a previous lesson or general knowledge and can spell *something* resembling it, they might get it. Two correct names would be very rare.

**basic:** 30% full marks
*   This group will likely understand the question with some effort. They will definitely know "Himalayas." The challenge will be recalling a *second* correct name in English. Many might only write "Himalayas." Some might manage "Aravalli" or "Vindhya" if it was emphasized and practiced repeatedly, but writing it correctly is still a challenge. Spelling will often be approximate.

**competent:** 75% full marks
*   This group will understand the question clearly. They will almost certainly know "Himalayas." They will likely be able to recall at least one more major range like "Aravalli," "Vindhya," or "Western Ghats." They might make minor spelling errors, but the names would be recognizable enough to be counted correct.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   This group will understand the question perfectly and know several major mountain ranges. They will confidently name at least two, such as Himalayas and Aravalli, or Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, etc. Their spelling will generally be accurate, or at least very close.
