This is a classic 'some/any' distinction, which can be tricky for students, especially those from Hindi-medium backgrounds, as direct translation might not always work.

Here's my breakdown based on experience:

*   **Struggling (35%):** These students often struggle with basic sentence comprehension, let alone grammatical nuances. They might choose 'any' randomly, or because it 'sounds' somewhat similar to 'many' which they might associate with quantity. They won't grasp the concept of 'some' for affirmative statements and 'any' for negative/interrogative.
    *   **Struggling: 5% full marks** (Likely guessing correctly, or perhaps one or two have a very good memory from a specific lesson).

*   **Basic (35%):** These students have some foundational understanding. They might have been introduced to 'some/any' but haven't fully internalized the rule. They might remember *seeing* 'some' with apples before, but might not be able to articulate *why*. They could get confused if they try to overthink it or misremember the rule.
    *   **Basic: 40% full marks** (Some will recall the rule, others might choose 'some' because it sounds more natural in an affirmative sentence, even without fully understanding the grammar).

*   **Competent (20%):** These students would have a decent grasp of basic grammar rules. They would likely recall the rule for 'some' in affirmative sentences and 'any' in negative/interrogative ones. They might have practiced similar examples.
    *   **Competent: 85% full marks** (Most would get this right, a few might make a silly mistake or momentarily forget).

*   **Advanced (10%):** These students would be comfortable with this grammatical concept. They would not only choose 'some' but could also explain the reason behind it.
    *   **Advanced: 100% full marks** (This is a straightforward application for them).
