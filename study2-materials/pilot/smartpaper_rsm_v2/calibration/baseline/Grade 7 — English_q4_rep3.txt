Here's my breakdown based on experience:

**struggling:** 5% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** Many will struggle to even read and comprehend the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?" let alone the preamble about the king's questions. They might pick up keywords but miss the core meaning.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This question requires reasoning *and* connecting it to the passage. Struggling students often just try to recall exact sentences from the text, which won't work here.
*   **Specificity:** "Any valid reason" sounds open-ended, but they need to articulate it in English.
*   **Common Mistakes:** They might simply say "Yes" without a reason, or give a reason that isn't connected to the "real life" aspect (e.g., "because the king wanted to know"). Many will leave it blank.

**basic:** 25% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** They can likely read and understand the question, though some might need a moment. The preamble helps them recall the context.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can usually recall the *content* of the king's questions. The "important in real life" part pushes them into reasoning, which some can do, but others might find challenging to express.
*   **Specificity:** They might give a general reason like "so we can do things well" or "so we don't make mistakes." If it's coherent and links to the idea of living effectively, it could score.
*   **Common Mistakes:** Providing a reason that is too vague or repetitive of the question itself. Difficulty in forming a grammatically correct and complete sentence for their reason.

**competent:** 70% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue reading or understanding.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They can easily recall the king's questions and connect them to the broader idea of making good decisions in life. They can articulate a clear reason.
*   **Specificity:** They will provide a valid reason such as "Yes, because knowing the right time helps us succeed," or "Yes, because it helps us make good choices and avoid problems."
*   **Common Mistakes:** Some might give a slightly less articulate reason, or focus more on the king's specific dilemma than the general "real life" application, but most will get the core idea.

**advanced:** 95% full marks
*   **Language Barrier:** No issue.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They will effortlessly connect the king's questions to universal principles of effective living, decision-making, and wisdom. They will articulate a concise and well-reasoned answer.
*   **Specificity:** They might say, "Yes, these questions are fundamental because making the right choices, at the right time, with the right people, leads to success and happiness in any aspect of life."
*   **Common Mistakes:** Very few, perhaps a minor grammatical error, but the content will be spot on. They might even offer a slightly more nuanced reason.
