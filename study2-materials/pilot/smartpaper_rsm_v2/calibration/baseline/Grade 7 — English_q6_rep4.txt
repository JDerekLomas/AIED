Okay, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 7 English students in a government school, especially with the given demographic and language challenges.

The question "Describes the poet's writing style" is a bit open-ended, which can be both a blessing and a curse. The rubric specifies "identifies a suitable and relevant word."

Here's my estimation for each group:

**Struggling (35% of class):** These students often struggle with basic comprehension, vocabulary, and forming coherent English sentences. They might not even understand what "writing style" means. Their primary focus is usually on understanding individual words, not abstract concepts like a poet's style. Even if they grasp the *gist* of a poem, articulating its style in a single word is very difficult. They might just pick a random word they remember from the poem or try to describe the *content* rather than the *style*.

*   **struggling: 0% full marks** (It's highly improbable they'd hit upon a suitable word consistently. They might get lucky, but it wouldn't be due to understanding the question or the concept.)

**Basic (35% of class):** These students can often understand simpler sentences and some vocabulary. They might have a basic understanding of what a "poet" is and what "writing" involves. However, "writing style" is still a somewhat abstract concept. They might be able to identify if the poem is happy or sad, but connecting that to "style" is a jump. They often look for keywords. If the poem used simple words, they *might* guess "simple." If it painted pictures, they *might* try "descriptive." But it requires a level of synthesis they often lack. They might give a phrase instead of a single word, or describe the *topic* of the poem.

*   **basic: 5% full marks** (A very small number might, through sheer luck or if the poem's style was exceedingly obvious and frequently discussed in class using those specific terms, identify one. For example, if we drilled "simple words = simple style" for a very basic poem, a few might recall.)

**Competent (20% of class):** These students generally understand the question. They can read and comprehend most sentences in the text. They have a better grasp of vocabulary and can make simple inferences. They would understand "writing style" and attempt to find a relevant adjective. They might think about the language used (simple, complex), the tone (informal, formal), or how the poet creates imagery (descriptive). They might list several words or struggle to pick the *best* single word, but they are in the right ballpark.

*   **competent: 50% full marks** (About half of them would be able to pinpoint a suitable word like "simple," "descriptive," or "informal." The others might give a slightly less precise word, or describe the content instead of the style, or give a phrase.)

**Advanced (10% of class):** These students are generally strong readers and thinkers. They understand abstract concepts and can articulate their thoughts well in English. They would understand "writing style" and be able to analyze the poem's structure, vocabulary, imagery, and tone to come up with a precise and relevant adjective. They would likely consider several options and pick the most appropriate one. They might even differentiate between "simple" and "direct" if the context allowed for such nuance.

*   **advanced: 90% full marks** (Most of them would easily get this. The 10% who might not could be due to a momentary lapse, misunderstanding a specific nuance of *that particular poem's* style, or perhaps picking a word that, while relevant, isn't quite as suitable as another. But generally, they would nail it.)
