Alright, let's break this down based on my experience with Class 7 in a government school, keeping in mind the specific challenges.

**struggling:** **0% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Most wouldn't even understand the instruction "Change from Active Voice to Passive Voice." The vocabulary "active," "passive," "voice" would be completely alien.
*   **Reading comprehension:** "The wind blew the leaves away" might be understood on a basic action level, but understanding its grammatical structure for transformation is beyond them.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This requires both recall of the passive voice rule and reasoning to apply it. They have neither.
*   **Common mistakes:** They wouldn't attempt it, or if forced, they'd just write down random words or try to rephrase it in active voice slightly differently.

**basic:** **5% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** Some might recognize "active" and "passive" if it's been taught very recently and repeatedly, but deep understanding is lacking. The instruction itself is a hurdle.
*   **Reading comprehension:** They'd likely understand the sentence "The wind blew the leaves away."
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This is where the struggle is. They might remember *that* the object becomes the subject, but the correct form of "to be" and the past participle of "blow" (blew -> blown) would be very difficult.
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Forgetting "by the wind."
    *   Incorrect auxiliary verb: "The leaves was blew away."
    *   Incorrect past participle: "The leaves were blowed away." or "The leaves were blew away."
    *   Completely rephrasing: "The leaves went because of wind."
    *   One or two might get it right by sheer rote memorization if a similar example was drilled just before.

**competent:** **50% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** They would understand the instruction and the sentence well enough.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would generally recall the main rules of passive voice (object becomes subject, use 'be' + past participle, 'by' phrase). The main challenge would be the irregular verb "blow."
*   **Common mistakes:**
    *   Incorrect past participle: "The leaves were *blewed* away by the wind." This is the most common error even among competent students with irregular verbs.
    *   Sometimes forgetting "by the wind," but less frequently.
    *   A few might struggle with the correct form of 'to be' if the subject is plural (e.g., "The leaves *was* blown away").

**advanced:** **90% full marks**
*   **Language barriers:** No issue with instruction or sentence.
*   **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would have a good grasp of the passive voice rules and irregular verbs. They would recall "blown" as the past participle of "blow."
*   **Common mistakes:** Very few. Perhaps a momentary lapse in concentration, or a very rare misspelling. The 10% not getting full marks would be due to a careless error rather than a fundamental misunderstanding. They understand the "why" behind the transformation.
