This is a good question that highlights the challenges we face in government schools with mixed ability groups and language barriers. Let's break down how my Class 7 English students would likely perform on this Active-to-Passive transformation.

**Struggling (35% of students): 0% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** Many wouldn't even understand the instruction "change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice." The words "active" and "passive" would be unfamiliar, and "voice" would likely be understood in its literal sense (sound).
* **Reading comprehension:** They might struggle to read "The wind blew the leaves away" correctly, mispronouncing words or not grasping the full meaning.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** This task requires both recall (knowing the rules for passive voice, verb forms) and reasoning (identifying subject, object, verb, tense). They lack the foundational recall and the reasoning skills in English grammar.
* **Common mistakes:** Even if they somehow understood the concept, they would struggle with past participle forms ("blown" vs. "blowed" or just "blow"), auxiliary verbs ("were" vs. "was" or just omission), and sentence structure. They might simply rearrange words randomly or change the meaning.

**Basic (35% of students): 5% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** Some might vaguely understand the instruction if it's been taught recently and simplified, but the technical terms "active" and "passive voice" would still be hazy. They might rely on remembering a "formula" if one was explicitly taught.
* **Reading comprehension:** They can generally read the sentence, but might not fully grasp its grammatical components.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They might recall a few passive voice rules for simple present/past, but applying them to a new sentence consistently would be hard. Their understanding of verb forms (past participle) would be shaky.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * "The leaves was blowed away by the wind." (incorrect auxiliary verb, incorrect past participle)
    * "The leaves blew away by the wind." (missing auxiliary verb)
    * "The leaves are blowing away by the wind." (incorrect tense)
    * Missing "by the wind" part.
    * Getting "blown" right but failing on "were".

**Competent (20% of students): 60% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** They would understand the instruction "change to passive voice" and have a fair grasp of the concept.
* **Reading comprehension:** They would read and understand the sentence perfectly.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would recall the rules for active-to-passive transformation for past tense and understand the need for the auxiliary verb "were" (because "leaves" is plural) and the past participle "blown." They could reason through the structure.
* **Common mistakes:**
    * Some might write "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (singular auxiliary with plural subject, a common mistake).
    * A few might forget "by the wind," especially if the emphasis in teaching was mainly on the subject-verb-object transformation.
    * A very small number might use "blowed" instead of "blown."

**Advanced (10% of students): 95% full marks**
* **Language barriers:** No issue at all. They would understand the grammatical terminology.
* **Reading comprehension:** Excellent.
* **Recall vs. Reasoning:** They would flawlessly recall the rules, correctly identify the tense, subject, object, and verb, and accurately apply the transformation, including the correct auxiliary verb ("were" for plural "leaves") and the irregular past participle ("blown").
* **Common mistakes:** It's rare for this group, but a very tiny percentage might make a careless error like writing "was" instead of "were" if they are rushing, or missing "by the wind" due to oversight, but it would be an anomaly rather than a pattern.
