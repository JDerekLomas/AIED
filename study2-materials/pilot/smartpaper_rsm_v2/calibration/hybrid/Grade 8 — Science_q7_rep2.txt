REASONING: This question requires recalling knowledge about decomposition and its benefits, similar to the "My favorite season" question which requires recalling personal experiences. However, the scientific vocabulary and explanation expected make it slightly harder than the narrative question, but easier than the differentiation question which demands more precise terminology and abstract thinking. The prompt is also relatively straightforward without complex language.
