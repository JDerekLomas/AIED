REASONING: This question is a direct application of basic inverse operations, a core skill taught by Class 8. While some students may make sign errors, the language is simple and the steps are fewer than the anchor items. It is similar to the 50% anchor, but the math operations might trip up some students more than recalling a factual list.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
