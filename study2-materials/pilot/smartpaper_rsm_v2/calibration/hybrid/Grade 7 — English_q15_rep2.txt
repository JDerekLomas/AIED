REASONING: This item is similar in structure and language demand to "My favorite season," which had a 30% pass rate. While slightly shorter in length (4-5 sentences vs. 6-8 lines), the topic is accessible and personal, allowing for simple sentence construction, similar to the anchor item's success. The explicit prompts of "what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" provide clear scaffolding.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
