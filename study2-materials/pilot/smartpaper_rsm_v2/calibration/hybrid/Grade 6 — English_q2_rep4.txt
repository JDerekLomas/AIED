REASONING: This question is a direct recall from the text, requiring minimal inference or complex language construction. It is easier than the paragraph writing and differentiation questions, and slightly easier than identifying the king's questions as it typically involves a single, easily identifiable answer from the story. Students' common errors of writing irrelevant sentences or leaving empty responses are less likely for a direct, simple recall like this.
