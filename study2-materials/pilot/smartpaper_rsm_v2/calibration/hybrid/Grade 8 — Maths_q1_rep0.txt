REASONING: This question involves a basic algebraic concept of solving for a variable, which is fundamental at this level. While some students might make sign errors (common in 'y + a = b' type equations), the language demand is minimal, and the operation is straightforward. It's comparable to the "My favorite season" prompt in terms of directness, but with a single correct numerical answer rather than descriptive writing.
