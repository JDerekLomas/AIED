REASONING: This question is slightly harder than "My favorite season" due to the specific factual recall required, but easier than "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" as it only asks for one feature, reducing the cognitive load. The common errors suggest difficulty with explanation and specific historical details, but the Harappan civilization is a core topic, making some recall likely.
