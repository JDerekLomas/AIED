REASONING: This question is easier than the "favorite season" paragraph, as it requires less sustained writing and provides clear reference points from the story. It's significantly easier than differentiating historical sources, which requires abstract reasoning and specific vocabulary. It builds directly on the anchor item about the king's questions, but adds a personal opinion, which is generally accessible to students, even those with limited English. The low pass rates for writing and abstract questions suggest that a simple "yes/no" followed by a basic reason will be within reach for a higher percentage of students.
