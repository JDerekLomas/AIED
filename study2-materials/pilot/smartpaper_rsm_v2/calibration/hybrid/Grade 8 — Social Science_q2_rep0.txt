REASONING: This question is comparable to "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" in terms of recall and specificity, but slightly harder due to requiring a descriptive answer rather than direct listing. It's less demanding than "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources" as it doesn't require comparison or complex definitions.
