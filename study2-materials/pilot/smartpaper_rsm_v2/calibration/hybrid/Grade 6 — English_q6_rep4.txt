REASONING: This question is easier than the "My favorite season" paragraph, as it requires less original composition. Students only need to recall a line and provide a simple reason, similar to the "King's questions" recall, but with a personal preference element. However, the need to *explain why* makes it slightly harder than just pure recall.
