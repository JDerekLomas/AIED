REASONING: This question is slightly easier than "My favorite season" because it requires recall of a specific factual detail, which students often perform better on than descriptive writing. However, it's harder than the "King's questions" because it asks for a *description* of a feature, not just listing it, which demands more precise language. The language demand is moderate, and reasoning is minimal (recall). Given the common errors in explanation and empty responses, a direct, factual recall with a short description might still be challenging for many.
