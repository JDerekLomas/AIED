REASONING: This question is harder than the "favorite season" and "king's questions" anchors because it requires scientific reasoning about decomposition and its benefits, rather than just recall or personal expression. It's comparable in difficulty to the "differentiate sources" anchor as it requires applying scientific concepts to a real-world scenario, but it is easier than the "pot experiment" and "turmeric powder" common error questions as it doesn't involve setting up or interpreting a complex experiment or abstract chemical reactions. The language is straightforward, but the requirement to "give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial" demands more than a simple observation.
