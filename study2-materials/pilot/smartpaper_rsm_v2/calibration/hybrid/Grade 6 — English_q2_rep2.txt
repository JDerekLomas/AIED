REASONING: This question is a direct recall from the text, requiring minimal inference and simple vocabulary. It is easier than the "favorite season" paragraph which demands creative expression and structured writing, and significantly easier than "differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" which requires higher-order thinking and specialized vocabulary. Compared to "three questions the king wanted to answer," it's slightly easier as the answer is a single, clear entity rather than a list of phrases.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 65%
