REASONING: This question is a direct recall from the text, requiring minimal inference and simple language. It is easier than the "favorite season" paragraph which demands more complex sentence construction and creative expression, and significantly easier than differentiating historical sources, which requires higher-order thinking and specialized vocabulary. The high pass rate for "the three questions" suggests students are capable of simple recall, making this item comparable in difficulty to that anchor.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
