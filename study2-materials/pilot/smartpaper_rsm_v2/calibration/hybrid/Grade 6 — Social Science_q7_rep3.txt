REASONING: This question is comparable to "My favorite season" in terms of accessibility and direct recall, but slightly harder due to requiring specific factual knowledge and a brief explanation. It's much easier than "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" as it doesn't demand complex comparative reasoning or abstract definitions. The explanation part requires a simple cause-and-effect understanding rather than multi-step reasoning or deep analysis, which aligns with common errors being about empty responses or irrelevant answers.
