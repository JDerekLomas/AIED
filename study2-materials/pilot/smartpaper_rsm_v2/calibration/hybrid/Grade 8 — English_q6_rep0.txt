REASONING: This question is a direct definition, requiring recall rather than creative writing or complex analysis, making it easier than paragraph writing or differentiation. However, it is more challenging than simply identifying three questions from a text, and the need to recall a specific definition may prove difficult for students with limited vocabulary or memorization skills, as seen in low pass rates for other definition-style questions.
