REASONING: This question requires recalling specific historical facts and understanding cause-and-effect relationships, which is harder than recalling simpler facts (King's questions) or writing a personal paragraph. It's also more complex than differentiating source types, but less prone to complete blanks than abstract "explain how" questions.
