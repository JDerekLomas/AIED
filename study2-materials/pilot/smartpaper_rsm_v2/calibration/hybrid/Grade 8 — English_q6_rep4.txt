REASONING: This question is a direct definition, requiring recall rather than creative writing or analytical skills. While it introduces a new vocabulary word, "fable," the concept is likely familiar from stories children hear. It is simpler than writing a paragraph or differentiating between historical sources, but slightly harder than recalling specific details from a story due to the new term.
