REASONING: This question is harder than the "favorite season" and "king's questions" anchors due to the scientific reasoning required for decomposition and its benefits, which aligns with common errors in experimental setup and chemical mixing. It's comparable to or slightly easier than the "archaeological vs. literary sources" question, as it asks for a practical observation and its benefits, rather than a more abstract differentiation, but still requires linking observation to scientific principles.
