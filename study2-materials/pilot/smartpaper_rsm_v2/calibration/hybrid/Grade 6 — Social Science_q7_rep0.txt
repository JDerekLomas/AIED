REASONING: This question is comparable to the "My favorite season" anchor item in terms of language demand and recall, but requires specific factual knowledge rather than personal expression. It is easier than the "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" as it asks for recall of facts rather than comparative analysis, and the examples are likely more familiar than abstract historical sources. The second part, explaining influence, requires a simple cause-and-effect understanding which should be accessible.
