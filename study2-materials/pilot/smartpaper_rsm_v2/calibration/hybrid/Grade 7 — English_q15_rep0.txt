REASONING: This item is slightly harder than the "My favourite season" anchor due to the increased length requirement (4-5 sentences vs. 6-8 lines which often results in single-word lines) and the need to include specific details (when and why). However, it is significantly easier than the history differentiation question and offers a familiar topic, similar to "My favourite season."
