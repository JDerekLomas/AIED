REASONING: This question is slightly easier than "My favorite season" due to its direct recall nature and fewer linguistic demands, and significantly easier than the differentiation question as it requires recalling only one specific feature rather than comparing two distinct concepts. Compared to the "king's questions" it is slightly harder as the information is not directly from a recent story, but it is a core concept taught in history.
