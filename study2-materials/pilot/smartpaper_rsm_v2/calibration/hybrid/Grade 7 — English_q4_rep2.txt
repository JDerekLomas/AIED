REASONING: This question is easier than the anchor items. It requires basic comprehension of the story and a simple opinion with a reason, aligning with the "My favorite season" item in terms of cognitive demand but with a more direct connection to the text. The language is straightforward, and students can draw on their personal experiences, reducing the likelihood of common errors like "Empty Response."
