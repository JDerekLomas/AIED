REASONING: This problem requires students to calculate the time difference and then perform a simple multiplication and addition. While the time calculation might pose a slight challenge for some, the numerical operations are straightforward. The language is clear and common errors in mathematics often relate to multi-step problems or operations with negative numbers, neither of which is prominently featured here. Compared to the 'king's questions' (50%), this is slightly more complex due to the time calculation, but easier than the 'archaeological sources' (15%) which requires recall of specific terms. The "My favorite season" (30%) is a writing task, making direct comparison difficult, but this Math problem is more structured and less open-ended.
