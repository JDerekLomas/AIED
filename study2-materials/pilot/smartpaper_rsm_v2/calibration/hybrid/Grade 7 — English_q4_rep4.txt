REASONING: This question is easier than the "favorite season" paragraph because it requires less writing and focuses on recall and simple reasoning. It's significantly easier than the "differentiate sources" question due to lower conceptual demand. Compared to the "three questions" anchor, it adds a layer of opinion/reasoning but is scaffolded by the previous question and students' familiarity with the story.
