REASONING: This question is harder than the "favorite season" anchor due to higher language demands and scientific reasoning. It is slightly easier than the "archaeological vs. literary sources" anchor because it relates to everyday experience, but still requires understanding decomposition and its benefits. Given the low pass rates on other science questions involving similar reasoning ("pot 'A'" at 6% and "turmeric powder" at 8%), I expect a lower pass rate.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
