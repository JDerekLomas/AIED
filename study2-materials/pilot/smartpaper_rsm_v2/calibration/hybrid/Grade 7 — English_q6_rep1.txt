REASONING: This new item is significantly harder than the "My favorite season" paragraph, "Three questions the king wanted to answer" and even "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" because it requires abstract thinking and meta-linguistic awareness, which are very high-order skills for Class 7 students, especially given the low baseline performance. The common error of students writing "I am reading" for this exact question demonstrates a severe disconnect between the prompt and their understanding.
