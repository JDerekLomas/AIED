REASONING: This item is similar to the "My favorite season" anchor. While "hobby" might be a slightly less familiar concept than "season" for some students, the structure of the prompt is very similar, requiring personal expression within a defined framework, which Class 7 students are generally developing. The sentence count is slightly lower, making it potentially a tiny bit easier in terms of output demand, but the core task is comparable.
