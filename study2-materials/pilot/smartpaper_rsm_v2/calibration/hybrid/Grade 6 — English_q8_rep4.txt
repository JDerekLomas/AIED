REASONING: This item is significantly easier than the anchors. It requires basic knowledge of sentence structure (SVO) with common, simple words, unlike the paragraph writing which demands creativity and sustained writing, or the differentiation question requiring conceptual understanding and recall. Even the "three questions" anchor, while having a higher pass rate, required students to extract specific information from a text.
