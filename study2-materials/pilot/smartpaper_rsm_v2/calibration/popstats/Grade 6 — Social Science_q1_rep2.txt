Okay, this is a very straightforward question, but considering the calibration data and my students' background, I need to adjust my expectations significantly.

The question asks for *any two* major mountain ranges. My students often struggle with recall and expression in English. Even if they know one, getting two correct and articulating them clearly can be a challenge. The average item difficulty is 29%, and this question feels like it *could* be one of the "easier" ones for my class, but "easier" in this context still means very few get it right.

Let's break it down:
1.  **Recall:** Many students will know "Himalayas." That's the most prominent.
2.  **Second range:** This is where the difficulty increases. Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura are common, but perhaps not as universally known or remembered as "Himalayas." Western/Eastern Ghats might be known if they've studied maps of South India well.
3.  **English Proficiency:** Naming them correctly in English can be an issue. They might know it in Hindi but struggle to translate or spell.
4.  **Scoring Rubric:** The rubric gives 0.5 for *one* correct mountain range. This question asks for *two* but the rubric implies that scoring full marks would mean getting *two* correct. Oh wait, the rubric says "Names one correct mountain range... Max score: 0.5". This means *any one* correct answer gets them full marks according to this specific rubric. That significantly changes things! If they only need to name *one* to get the max score of 0.5, then the pass rate for this item should be higher than for a question requiring two.

Re-evaluating with the rubric: "Names one correct mountain range (e.g., Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats). Max score: 0.5"
This means if a student writes "Himalayas", they get full marks. This is much easier than naming two.

Given the average item difficulty is 29%, and this question is likely on the easier side *because only one is required for full marks*, I would expect a slightly higher pass rate. Many would know "Himalayas." Some might also know Aravallis or Vindhya. However, the overall low performance across the exam is a strong anchor. Students from economically weaker sections, especially those with limited exposure to general knowledge beyond curriculum, might still struggle even with just one name.

I'd place it slightly above the average difficulty, as "Himalayas" is quite well-known. Perhaps it falls into the 30-40% range of pass rates, but not much higher due to the overall context. If the rubric demanded two for full marks, I'd put it much lower (maybe 15-20%). But for just one, it's more accessible.

Let's consider the upper end of the 10th-90th percentile (0.53). This item, requiring only one correct name, might reach that level if it's truly one of the easiest. "Himalayas" is fundamental.

My initial gut feeling, given the average item difficulty of 29%, and this question being relatively straightforward (requiring only one name), is that it would perform better than average, but not overwhelmingly so due to the population's general struggles. I'll peg it at the higher end of what I'd consider a "good" performance for this group on a simpler item.
