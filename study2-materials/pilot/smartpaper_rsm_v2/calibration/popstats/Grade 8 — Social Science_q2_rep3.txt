As an experienced teacher in an Indian government school, teaching Class 8 Social Science, I have a good sense of my students' capabilities and common challenges. Considering the calibration data and my experience:

*   **Low overall performance:** The average item difficulty is 29%, which means most students struggle significantly. This isn't a high-performing group on average.
*   **Language barrier:** Many students are from Hindi-medium backgrounds, and "urban planning" and "Harappan Civilization" might be understood in Hindi, but articulating a "key feature" precisely in English can be a hurdle. They might know some facts but struggle with structured English answers.
*   **Specific knowledge vs. recall:** Harappan Civilization is a core topic, so they would have been taught it. However, recalling *one key feature* explicitly and describing it well enough to score full marks is the challenge. They might remember bits and pieces (e.g., "they had bricks"), but not necessarily "well-planned grid layout" or "advanced drainage system" as a coherent point.
*   **Rubric specificity:** The rubric asks for a *description* of a *key feature*. Simple one-word answers like "bricks" might not get full credit if not elaborated. "Well-planned grid layout of streets" or "advanced drainage system" requires a certain level of conceptual understanding and vocabulary.

Based on these factors, while Harappan civilization is a fundamental topic, achieving full marks on this specific question, given the language barrier and the general low performance, would be challenging for a large segment of the class. Many might offer partial answers or struggle with the English formulation.
