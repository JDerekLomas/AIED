Given the context, here's my reasoning:

1.  **Student Profile:** Class 8, Indian government school, mostly from economically weaker sections, limited English proficiency, many from Hindi-medium backgrounds. This means they struggle with comprehension, vocabulary, and expressing themselves clearly in English.

2.  **Calibration Data:**
    *   Average item difficulty: 29%
    *   Median: 26%
    *   34% of items have <20% pass rate
    *   63% of items have <30% pass rate
    *   This population performs MUCH lower than expected.

3.  **Question Analysis:** "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."
    *   **Topic:** Harappan Civilization's urban planning is a core topic in Class 8 Social Science (History). It's typically covered in textbooks and often highlighted as a distinct feature of this civilization.
    *   **Keywords:** "Harappan Civilization," "urban planning," "key feature." These are standard terms.
    *   **Expected Answers (from rubric):** Grid layout, advanced drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town. These are the most common and easily recalled features.
    *   **Difficulty:** While the *topic* is central, articulating a "key feature" clearly in English can be a challenge for students with limited English proficiency. They might know *about* it but struggle to formulate a concise answer. Many might offer fragmented ideas or single words rather than a description. For example, they might write "drainage" but not "advanced drainage system" or "well-planned grid layout of streets."

4.  **Connecting to Calibration Data:** The average pass rate is 29%. This question is about a fundamental concept that is usually emphasized. However, the requirement to "describe" and the potential language barrier will prevent many from achieving full marks, even if they have some knowledge.

    *   It's more difficult than simply recalling a date or a name, but less abstract than analyzing a cause-and-effect relationship.
    *   The "well-planned" nature is a common theme. Students might remember "drainage" or "grid system" but might not articulate it *descriptively* enough to fully satisfy the rubric if the teacher is strict about "describes."
    *   Given the overall low performance (29% average), even core topics don't see high pass rates. Many students struggle to recall details accurately or express them comprehensibly.

5.  **Estimate:**
    *   It's a foundational topic, so some students *will* know it.
    *   However, the language barrier and the need for a *description* (not just a word) will depress scores.
    *   It's unlikely to be in the "less than 20%" category because it's so fundamental.
    *   It's also unlikely to be significantly *above* the 29% average, as it still requires clear articulation in English, which is a major hurdle.
    *   I'd place it slightly above the median, but still within the typical range, reflecting that while the content is familiar, execution is difficult. I expect some students to get partial credit (not factored here as the rubric is 0 or 1), or provide insufficient descriptions.

Therefore, anchoring to the 29% average and considering the factors, I'd expect it to be close to the average, perhaps slightly above due to its core nature, but not significantly higher because of language and descriptive requirements.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 32%
