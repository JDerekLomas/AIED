Let's break this down based on the given calibration data and the context of my students.

**Understanding the Question:**
The question asks for two natural resources in Rajasthan and the influence of one. It's a two-part question, but the rubric awards full marks for just *mentioning two correct natural resources*. This simplifies the scoring significantly.

**Student Characteristics and Challenges:**
1.  **Economically Weaker Sections:** Limited exposure, potentially less access to diverse learning materials or supplementary education.
2.  **Hindi-medium background, Limited English Proficiency:** While the question is simple, some students might struggle with understanding "natural resources" or "influences" if their English vocabulary is weak. However, in Social Science, these terms are frequently used, so many might recognize them.
3.  **Rajasthan Context:** Students living in Rajasthan are likely aware of common resources in their state. Water scarcity is a huge issue, and minerals are a major industry. Sand and sunlight are also very visible.

**Analyzing the Rubric:**
The rubric is very generous: "Mentions two correct natural resources". This means they don't even need to explain the influence. This drastically increases the probability of getting full marks compared to if they had to explain it well.

**Considering Common Answers:**
*   **Water:** Even with scarcity, students know its importance and that it's a natural resource. This would be a very common answer.
*   **Sand:** Rajasthan is known for deserts. Sand is a very obvious natural resource.
*   **Sunlight (for solar energy):** Given the government's push for solar, and the sheer amount of sunlight, this is a plausible answer, especially for slightly more aware students.
*   **Minerals (Marble, Copper, Gypsum, Mica, Limestone, Zinc, Salt):** Rajasthan is rich in minerals. While naming specific ones might be harder for some, "minerals" or even just "marble" or "salt" (from Sambhar Lake) are very plausible.
*   **Wind (for wind energy):** Similar to solar, modern awareness might lead to this.

**Applying Calibration Data:**
*   The average item difficulty is 29%. This means the *average* item has only 29% correct.
*   This particular item's rubric is very lenient, making it easier than many others that might require more complex understanding or explanation.
*   The fact that they only need to *list two* makes it highly accessible. Students will definitely know *one* (like water or sand), and thinking of a second one (like a mineral or another environmental factor) should be manageable for a significant portion.

Given the generous rubric (just listing two, no explanation needed), and the local relevance of the resources, I believe this item would perform *better* than the average 29%. Students living in Rajasthan are immersed in the realities of its natural resources.

If the question required explanation, the percentage would drop significantly. But merely listing two, especially common ones like water, sand, or a prominent mineral, is a relatively low cognitive load.
