REASONING: The previous questions show a very low pass rate for open-ended questions requiring higher-order thinking or paragraph construction. This question is a simple fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice style question testing basic grammar, which is more accessible. While 'any' is a common confusion, the structure of this question makes it more straightforward.
