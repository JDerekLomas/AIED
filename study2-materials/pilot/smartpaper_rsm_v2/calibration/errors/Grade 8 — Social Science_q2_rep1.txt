REASONING: Given the prevalence of empty responses and off-topic answers in previous questions, a significant number of students are likely to leave this question blank or provide irrelevant information. Even for those who attempt it, limited English proficiency and unfamiliarity with specific historical terms might prevent them from articulating a "key feature" clearly enough to score full marks, especially if they struggle with precise vocabulary like "grid layout," "drainage system," or "citadel."
