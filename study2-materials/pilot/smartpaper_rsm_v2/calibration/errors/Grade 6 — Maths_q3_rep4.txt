REASONING: Students may struggle with comparing numbers with different digit counts (e.g., 736 vs. 3367), potentially overlooking that a smaller number of digits usually means a smaller value. They might also transpose digits or struggle with the "ascending order" instruction itself. Given the low overall pass rate, basic place value comparison is likely a significant hurdle.
