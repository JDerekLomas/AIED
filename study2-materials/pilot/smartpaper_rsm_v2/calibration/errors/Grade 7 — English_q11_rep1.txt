REASONING: Given the extremely low pass rates on other questions requiring even basic comprehension and sentence construction, most students will likely struggle to identify an adjective, let alone an adjective phrase. Many will leave it blank or make a wild guess. Even though the rubric only requires identifying "tiny" as an adjective, the question asks for an "adjective phrase," which will confuse students.
