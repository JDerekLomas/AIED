REASONING: This question is a direct recall from a story, similar to the "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) but likely simpler because it's a single, distinct fact rather than a list. The "Last Bargain" theme question (5%) required analytical thinking, and the "Favorite Season" (30%) and "Archaeological vs. Literary Sources" (15%) required paragraph writing/differentiation. The "Fundamental Rights" (66%) required specific factual recall, but from a broader civic knowledge base. This "Who lived inside the book?" question is a very straightforward, single-fact recall from a text, making it one of the easiest recall questions.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
