REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "My favorite season" prompt, as it asks for personal opinion and recall of a familiar text, but requires direct quotation which might be a slight hurdle. It is easier than the "Last Bargain" theme question which requires abstract thought, and harder than the "King's three questions" which is direct recall from a passage.
