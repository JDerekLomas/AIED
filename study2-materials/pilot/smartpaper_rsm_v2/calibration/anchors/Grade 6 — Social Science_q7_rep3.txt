REASONING: This question is harder than the 66% and 50% anchor items because it requires both recall of two specific natural resources and an explanation of their influence, which is a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall. It's comparable to the 30% anchor in terms of requiring multiple pieces of information and explanation, but might be slightly more challenging due to the specific geographical context. It is easier than the 5% and 15% anchors as it is more concrete and directly relates to content often taught.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
