REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) in terms of recall and specificity, but it requires geographical knowledge which some students may struggle with. However, the rubric for this question is more lenient (0.5 for just one correct answer) than the Fundamental Rights question (1 mark for two correct answers).
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
