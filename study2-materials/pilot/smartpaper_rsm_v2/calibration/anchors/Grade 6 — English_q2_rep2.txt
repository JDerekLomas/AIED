REASONING: This question is a direct recall from a story, similar in cognitive demand to the "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) but with a single, clear answer rather than a list. It's much simpler than the "Last Bargain" theme (5%), the "archaeological vs. literary sources" differentiation (15%), or even the "My favorite season" paragraph (30%) which requires synthesis and expression. It's also slightly easier than the "Fundamental Rights" (66%) because it tests specific story comprehension rather than general civic knowledge.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
