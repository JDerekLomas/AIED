REASONING: This question is similar to the "My favorite season" prompt, as it asks for personal preference and justification, which students often find easier than analytical tasks. However, it requires direct recall and interpretation of a specific line from a poem, which might be slightly more challenging than simply naming a favorite season. The poem "The Last Bargain" is abstract and philosophical, which could make it harder for students to pick a line and explain its appeal compared to, say, a simpler narrative poem.
