REASONING: This item is similar in structure and expected output to the "My favorite season" anchor item (30% pass rate) but requires slightly fewer sentences and is a more common topic. It's harder than the "Fundamental Rights" question (66%) as it demands creative writing, but easier than the "Last Bargain" theme (5%) or "Archaeological vs. Literary sources" (15%) which require deeper analytical or factual recall. It's also likely slightly easier than "The Three Questions" (50%) as it doesn't rely on recalling specific passage details.
