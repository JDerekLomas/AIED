REASONING: This question is harder than the "Fundamental Rights" and "King's questions" anchors because it requires interpretation and abstract thinking, rather than recall of specific facts. It is comparable to "My favorite season" in requiring students to generate their own description, but it's more challenging as it asks for an analytical observation rather than a personal preference. It is easier than the "Last Bargain" and "Archaeological sources" anchors because it only asks for a single word and does not require understanding a complex theme or differentiating between nuanced concepts.
