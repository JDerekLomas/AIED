REASONING: This question involves basic arithmetic and understanding time, which is a fundamental skill taught extensively by Class 6. While word problems can be tricky, the numbers are simple, and the concept of temperature increase is relatable. It's likely easier than the English comprehension (poem theme, paragraph writing) and history questions, and comparable to the fact-recall questions if the students can accurately calculate elapsed time.
