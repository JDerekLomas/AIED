REASONING: This question is harder than the "Fundamental Rights" and "King's questions" items, as it requires a higher level of analytical thinking and vocabulary beyond direct recall. It's similar in difficulty to the "Favorite Season" item, as both require students to generate descriptive language, but "writing style" is more abstract. It's easier than the "Last Bargain" theme question, which requires abstract thematic understanding. It's also easier than the "Archaeological vs. Literary" question, which requires specific definitions and examples.
