REASONING: This item is likely to be harder than "My favorite season" and "Fundamental Rights" because it requires a specific grammatical transformation, which many students struggle with. It's comparable to "Archaeological vs. Literary Sources" in requiring precise knowledge, but potentially harder for a Class 7 student who may have limited exposure to or practice with active/passive voice transformations. The "The Last Bargain" and "King's Questions" items are more about comprehension, which can be challenging, but grammar rules can often feel like rote memorization without true understanding.
