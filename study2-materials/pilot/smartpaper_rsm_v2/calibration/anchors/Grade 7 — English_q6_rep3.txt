REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "Fundamental Rights" question (66% pass rate) as it requires a single, direct answer based on general knowledge or understanding of poetry, but it might be slightly harder than naming rights because it requires a more subjective interpretation of a "style." It is much easier than identifying a theme or differentiating sources as it doesn't require deep analysis or complex recall.
