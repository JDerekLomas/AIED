REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) in that it asks for a specific factual recall from the textbook. It's likely slightly harder than naming two Fundamental Rights because "Harappan urban planning" might be a less frequently revised topic than Fundamental Rights, and students might struggle to articulate one specific feature clearly. However, it's easier than differentiating between archaeological and literary sources because it only requires recall of one specific point, not a comparison.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
