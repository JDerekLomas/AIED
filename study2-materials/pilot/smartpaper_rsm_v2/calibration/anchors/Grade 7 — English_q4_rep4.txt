REASONING: This question requires students to recall the king's questions (50% pass rate anchor) and then connect them to real life with a simple justification. The second part, giving a reason, is similar to the "My favorite season" question where students had to explain why they liked it (30% pass rate anchor), but here only one reason is required, making it slightly simpler. However, the open-ended nature of "give one reason" might still be challenging for some.
