REASONING: This question requires students to recall knowledge about decomposition, connect it to practical observation, and understand its impact on soil health. The question is slightly more complex than direct recall questions like naming fundamental rights, but less abstract than interpreting a poem's theme. The language is straightforward, but the multi-part nature of the question (observation, reason, evaluation) increases the cognitive load compared to the "King's questions" item. Many students may grasp the "change" but struggle with articulating the "reasons" or "beneficial" aspect clearly, especially with the limited English proficiency observed in the anchor responses.
