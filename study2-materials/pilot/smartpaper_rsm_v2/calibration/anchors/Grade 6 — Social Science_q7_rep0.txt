REASONING: This question is harder than the 66% and 50% pass rate anchor items as it requires both recall of specific facts (two natural resources) and a basic explanation of influence, which is more complex than direct recall from a passage. However, it's likely easier than the 30% and 15% items as "natural resources" is a fundamental concept in geography, and examples from a well-known state like Rajasthan might be more accessible than abstract themes or historical differentiation. Students will likely struggle with the "explain how it influences" part.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
