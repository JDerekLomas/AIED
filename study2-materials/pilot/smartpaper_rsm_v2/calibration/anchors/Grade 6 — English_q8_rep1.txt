REASONING: This item is significantly easier than all the anchor items. It tests basic sentence structure, which is a foundational skill in English, unlike abstract themes, historical differentiation, descriptive writing, or even recalling specific factual information like Fundamental Rights, all of which require higher-order thinking or memorization. It's even simpler than recalling information directly from a passage, as it only requires rearranging words already given.
