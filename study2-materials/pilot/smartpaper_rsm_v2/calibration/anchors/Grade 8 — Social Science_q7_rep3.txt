REASONING: This question requires historical knowledge and the ability to explain cause and effect, similar to the "Fundamental Rights" question but asking for a more detailed explanation of a specific historical event rather than just naming two items. It is more complex than the "King's Questions" which was direct recall from a passage. Students might struggle with the specific historical details and linking them to British expansion.
