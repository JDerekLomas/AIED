REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) as it requires recalling a simple definition, which is likely taught directly from the textbook. It's easier than "differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" as it only requires one definition, not two, and no examples.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
