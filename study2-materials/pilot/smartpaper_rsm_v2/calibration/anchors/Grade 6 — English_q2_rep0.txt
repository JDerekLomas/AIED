REASONING: This question requires recalling a specific detail from a story, similar to the 50% pass rate anchor item about the king's questions. However, "who" lived inside the book is a more direct recall than "what were the three questions," which requires remembering three distinct points. The answer is also simpler ("a fairy" vs. three distinct questions), making it slightly easier.
