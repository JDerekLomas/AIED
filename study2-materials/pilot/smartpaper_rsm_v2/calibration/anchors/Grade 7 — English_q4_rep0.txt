REASONING: This question is slightly harder than the 50% anchor item because it requires an inferential leap and personal opinion, not just recall from the text. While the 50% anchor asks for direct recall of the questions, this question asks students to apply the relevance of those questions to real life, which requires a bit more critical thinking and expression. However, it's still relatively straightforward, and students can give a simple, common-sense reason. It is much easier than the "theme" question and the "differentiate" question, as those require abstract thinking or specific knowledge that many students struggle with.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
