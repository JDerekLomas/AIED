REASONING: This question is harder than the 66% anchor item (Fundamental Rights) because it requires a precise grammatical identification rather than recall of factual knowledge. It is comparable to the 50% anchor (king's questions) in that it requires reading comprehension of the provided sentence, but it is more challenging because it asks for a specific grammatical term rather than direct recall of information from a passage. The key difficulty here is that students are likely to confuse "adjective" with "adjective phrase" or struggle to identify an adjective at all.
