REASONING: This question is harder than the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66%) because it requires knowledge of a specific grammatical term ("adjective phrase") and its application, which is often a challenge for students. While "tiny" is a simple adjective, identifying it *as an adjective phrase* (when it's just a single word) can be confusing, making it more challenging than recalling factual information. It is easier than the "Last Bargain" anchor (5%) as it's a direct identification question rather than an abstract concept.
