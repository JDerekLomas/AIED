REASONING: This item is similar in structure and expectation to the "My Favorite Season" anchor item (30% pass rate) but requires fewer sentences (4-5 vs 6-8) and focuses on a more personal, potentially less complex topic for children (hobbies vs. abstract season attributes). It is also less demanding than the "The Last Bargain" or "Archaeological Sources" items, which require abstract thinking or specific factual recall.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
