REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the Fundamental Rights question (66% pass rate) as it requires recalling a specific factual detail from a familiar topic, but potentially slightly harder than the King's three questions (50%) due to the need to describe a specific feature rather than just list something directly from a provided text.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%
