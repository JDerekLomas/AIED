REASONING: This item is significantly harder than the 66% and 50% pass rate anchors because it requires understanding a specific grammatical concept (adjective phrase) rather than recalling factual information from a text or general knowledge. It's comparable to the 30% anchor in terms of conceptual understanding, but "adjective phrase" is a more specific and potentially less familiar concept than writing about a favorite season. The 5% and 15% anchors are harder, requiring deeper analytical skills for poetry or nuanced historical definitions. The rubric here only asks for "tiny" as an adjective, not an "adjective phrase," which simplifies it, but the question uses "adjective phrase," potentially confusing students if they are looking for a multi-word phrase. Given the actual performance on abstract concepts in the anchor items, I anticipate a low pass rate.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
