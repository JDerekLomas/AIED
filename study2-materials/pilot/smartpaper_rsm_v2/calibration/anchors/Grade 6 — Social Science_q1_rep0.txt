REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" question in terms of recall, but it asks for geographical facts that are generally well-covered in Class 6 Social Science. The content on major mountain ranges is typically introduced and reinforced multiple times in geography chapters. Students are likely to recall at least one or two, especially the Himalayas. The scoring rubric requiring only one correct name for 0.5 marks makes it even more accessible for students to score at least something.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
