REASONING: This question is comparable to the 66% pass rate anchor because it asks for recall of two specific facts and a simple explanation, which aligns with basic memorization and comprehension often tested in Class 6. However, the explanation part adds a slight increase in cognitive demand compared to just naming, making it a bit harder than merely listing the Fundamental Rights.
