REASONING: This question is at a similar difficulty level to the 50% anchor item, as it requires recall of basic science concepts (decomposition) and simple inferential reasoning, which many students might grasp intuitively. However, the requirement to "give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial" adds a layer of complexity beyond simple recall, preventing it from being as easy as the 66% anchor. The concept of decomposition of organic matter, its benefits for soil health, and the formation of compost is a fundamental topic covered in Class 8 Science.
