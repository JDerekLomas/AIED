REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" anchor in terms of requiring recall of specific factual information, but it's slightly harder as it asks for a brief description of one. It's easier than "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" as it doesn't require differentiation or more complex understanding.
