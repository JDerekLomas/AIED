REASONING: This question requires students to recall information about decomposition, which is a core concept in Class 8 Science. However, it also demands applying that knowledge to a real-world scenario and then evaluating its benefit, which adds a layer of complexity. While not as abstract as interpreting poetry, it's more involved than simply listing facts or extracting direct information from a passage. The "give reasons and evaluate" part will likely challenge many students, making it harder than simple recall but potentially easier than tasks requiring deep conceptual understanding or creative writing.
