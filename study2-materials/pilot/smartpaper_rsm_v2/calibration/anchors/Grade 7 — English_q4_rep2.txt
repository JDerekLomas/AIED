REASONING: This question requires students to recall the king's questions (like the 50% anchor) and then connect them to real life with a simple reason. The reasoning part is subjective and less demanding than identifying a theme (5% anchor) or differentiating historical sources (15% anchor). It's more akin to giving examples of fundamental rights (66% anchor) but involves a slight interpretative step.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
