REASONING: This question is comparable to the 50% pass rate anchor item (King's questions) as it requires recall of specific facts and a basic understanding of cause and effect, which Class 6 students typically struggle with beyond simple memorization. However, it's slightly harder than the 66% anchor item (Fundamental Rights) because it asks for an *explanation* of influence, not just naming.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
