REASONING: This item requires identifying a basic grammatical concept (adjective) which is typically taught and reinforced in Class 7 English. Compared to analyzing a poem's theme or differentiating historical sources, it is a more direct recall of a definition, making it significantly easier. The question asks for an "adjective phrase" but the rubric only requires identifying "tiny" which is a single adjective, making the task even simpler than the phrasing suggests.
