REASONING: This question is a direct recall from a story, similar to the "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) but likely even simpler as it only requires naming a single character. It's much easier than theme identification (5%), differentiation (15%), or paragraph writing (30%).
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
