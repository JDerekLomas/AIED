REASONING: This question is comparable in difficulty to the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" anchor. Both require recall of specific factual information from the syllabus, with a relatively straightforward answer. The added "describe any one in brief" might slightly increase difficulty compared to just naming, but the description can be very brief.
