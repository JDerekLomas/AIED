REASONING: This question is a direct application of a fundamental geometry formula, likely taught in Class 7. Compared to the English and social studies anchor items, it requires less comprehension and recall of abstract concepts or extensive writing. The math anchor items are not provided, but based on the general curriculum, this would be considered a straightforward procedural question. It is easier than the "Last Bargain" and "archaeological/literary sources" questions as it's a direct calculation, not a conceptual understanding of literature or history. It's comparable to, if not slightly easier than, the "Fundamental Rights" question, as it's a formula application rather than a memorization task, and errors are often due to calculation mistakes rather than lack of knowledge of the formula itself.
