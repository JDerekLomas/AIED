REASONING: This question involves basic arithmetic and understanding time, which is usually well-practiced. However, the multi-step nature (calculating time elapsed, then multiplying, then adding) might trip up a significant number of students, similar to the "three questions the king wanted to answer" where recall was simple but specific detail was needed, or "My favorite season" which required structured thinking. The students' performance on the English poem theme and history differentiation shows difficulty with abstract thinking, which is less present here. The core math skills are simple, but the applied problem-solving aspect will reduce the pass rate from the very highest anchor items.
