REASONING: This item tests basic grammar knowledge of determiners, which is typically taught and reinforced early in English language learning. Compared to the anchor items, it requires recall of a simple rule rather than complex comprehension, extended writing, or historical knowledge. I would expect a much higher pass rate than the anchors due to its simplicity and directness.
