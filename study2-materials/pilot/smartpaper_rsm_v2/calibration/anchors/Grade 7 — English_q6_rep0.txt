REASONING: This question is harder than the 66% and 50% pass rate anchor items as it requires inferential thinking about style, rather than recall or direct retrieval from text. It is similar in difficulty to the 15% anchor item on archaeological vs. literary sources, as both require understanding a concept and applying a descriptor. It's easier than the 5% item as it doesn't require synthesizing a complex theme.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
