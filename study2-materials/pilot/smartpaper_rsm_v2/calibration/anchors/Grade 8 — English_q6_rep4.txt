REASONING: This question requires recalling a definition, similar to the "Fundamental Rights" and "Archaeological/Literary sources" questions, but it is less complex than the latter as it only asks for one definition. It's harder than the "King's three questions" which is a direct recall from a text, and much easier than the "theme" question which requires higher-order thinking.
