REASONING: This question is similar in difficulty to the "My favorite season" prompt (30% pass rate) because it requires personal expression and recall from the poem, but it's slightly harder due to needing to accurately quote a line. It's much easier than the "Last Bargain" theme question, as it doesn't require abstract thinking or deep understanding of theme.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
