REASONING: This question involves basic number ordering, a concept typically introduced and reinforced in earlier grades (Class 3-4). While some students might struggle with attention to detail or place value, the task itself is fundamental. It is significantly easier than comprehension or analytical tasks (like "The Last Bargain" or differentiating historical sources) and simpler than paragraph writing or recalling specific facts from a passage. It's comparable in complexity to naming fundamental rights, but perhaps slightly easier as it doesn't rely on rote memorization of civics terms. The rubric only requires identifying the smallest number correctly and placing it first, which simplifies the task further than needing the full correct order.
