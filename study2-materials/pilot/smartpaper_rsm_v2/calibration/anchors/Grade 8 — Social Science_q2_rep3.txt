REASONING: This question is comparable to the 66% pass rate anchor item ("Name any two Fundamental Rights") because it asks for recall of a specific factual detail from a Social Science topic. However, it's slightly harder as it requires a "description" rather than just "naming," and it's a single feature rather than two, which might limit partial credit opportunities.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
