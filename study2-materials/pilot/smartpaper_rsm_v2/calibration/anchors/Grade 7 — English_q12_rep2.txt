REASONING: This question requires applying a grammatical rule, which is a common but sometimes tricky area for students. While it's not rote memorization like Fundamental Rights, it's less abstract than identifying a poem's theme and doesn't require composing a paragraph or retrieving specific details from a passage. It's comparable to the "differentiate sources" question in requiring specific knowledge application but on a grammatical concept rather than historical facts. Many students struggle with active/passive voice transformations, especially with irregular verbs like "blow" becoming "blown."
