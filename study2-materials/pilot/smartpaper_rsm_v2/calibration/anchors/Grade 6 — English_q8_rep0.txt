REASONING: This item is significantly easier than all anchor items. It tests a very basic grammatical structure (subject-verb-object) that Class 6 students would have practiced extensively, likely through drills and simple sentence construction exercises. Unlike the anchor items, it doesn't require comprehension, creative writing, recall of specific knowledge, or abstract thought. The only challenge is word order, which is a foundational skill.
