REASONING: This question is comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" anchor (66% pass rate) as it requires recalling specific information taught in class. While "The Last Bargain" (5%) and "Archaeological vs. Literary" (15%) involved more abstract understanding or detailed differentiation, this question asks for direct recall of common occupations in a specific region, which is usually covered quite explicitly. Students may struggle with describing one occupation "in brief" if they only recall names, but identifying two occupations should be achievable for a significant portion of the class. It is likely slightly harder than "Fundamental Rights" as it requires two distinct occupations and a brief description, rather than just two names.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
