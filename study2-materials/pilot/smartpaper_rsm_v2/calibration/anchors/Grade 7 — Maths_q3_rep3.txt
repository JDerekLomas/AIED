REASONING: This question is a direct application of a fundamental formula, similar in cognitive demand to naming fundamental rights or recalling information directly from a passage. However, it requires a mathematical calculation which can be a common error point. I believe it's harder than simply naming rights but easier than complex differentiation or theme identification.
