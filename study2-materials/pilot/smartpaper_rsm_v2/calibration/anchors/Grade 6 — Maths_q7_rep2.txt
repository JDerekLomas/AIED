REASONING: This question involves basic arithmetic and understanding of time, which is a common skill taught in Class 6. While some students might struggle with calculating the elapsed time, the core calculation is straightforward multiplication and addition, making it comparable to the 50-66% range where direct retrieval or simple application of learned facts is sufficient. It's easier than the poetry or history questions requiring interpretation or differentiating concepts.
