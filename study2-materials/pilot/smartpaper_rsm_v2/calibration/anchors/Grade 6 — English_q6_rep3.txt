REASONING: This question is harder than the 50% anchor because it requires more than direct recall; students need to interpret and justify their choice, which involves a deeper understanding and expression. It's also harder than the 30% anchor because while both require personal expression, the poem-based question demands engagement with specific textual elements. It's similar to the 15% anchor in requiring interpretation and specific examples, but the "why" component adds a layer of difficulty.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 10%
