REASONING: This item is likely harder than the 50% anchor item (king's questions) as it requires a transformation of grammatical structure, not just recall from a passage. However, it's probably easier than the 5% anchor (poem theme) and the 15% anchor (historical sources) because it deals with a single grammatical rule rather than abstract interpretation or detailed factual recall. It's comparable to the 30% anchor (favorite season) in that it requires productive language use, but perhaps slightly more challenging due to the specific grammatical rule application.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%
