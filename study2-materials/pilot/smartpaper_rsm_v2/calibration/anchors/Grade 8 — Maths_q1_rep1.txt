REASONING: This item involves a simple algebraic equation that requires understanding inverse operations. While some students might struggle with negative numbers, it is a fundamental concept taught in Class 8 mathematics and is conceptually simpler than interpreting a poem or differentiating historical sources. It's likely easier than the 30% pass rate 'My favorite season' which requires paragraph writing skills and vocabulary, and certainly easier than the English poem analysis or social science questions. It is probably similar in difficulty to the 'Three questions the king wanted to answer' item, as both test direct recall/application of taught concepts, but this math question has a single, definitive correct answer without any scope for nuanced interpretation.
ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
