REASONING: This question is harder than the 66% anchor item (Fundamental Rights) because it requires more than simple recall. It's comparable to the 50% anchor (King's questions) in that it requires identifying a specific element within a given text, but it's slightly harder because "adjective phrase" is a more abstract concept than "three questions." The instruction "adjective phrase" is also a distractor, as "tiny" is an adjective, not a phrase. Given the low performance on the "theme" question (5%), which also involves abstract concepts and misinterpretation of the term "theme," students are likely to struggle with identifying a grammatical element correctly, especially with the misdirection of "phrase" vs. "word."
