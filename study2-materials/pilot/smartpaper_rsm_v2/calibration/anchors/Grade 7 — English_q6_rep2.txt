REASONING: This question is harder than the "Fundamental Rights" and "King's Questions" items as it requires inferential understanding of literary style, which is a higher-order skill than recalling facts from a text or general knowledge. It's comparable to the "My favorite season" item in terms of requiring a descriptive answer, but it's more abstract, making it harder. It is easier than the "Last Bargain" theme question as it focuses on style rather than a complex thematic interpretation.
