<chain_of_thought>
The item assesses substitution into a formula involving an even exponent and a negative base. The primary cognitive challenge is the application of the rule that a negative number raised to an even power results in a positive value, which is a common area for student errors. The item is concise and follows standard UK curriculum formatting for Key Stage 3 and 4, making it highly clear but prone to a specific, strong misconception regarding signs and multiplication.
