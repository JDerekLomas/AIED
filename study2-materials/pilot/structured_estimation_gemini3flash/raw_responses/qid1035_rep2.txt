The item assesses the expansion of a single bracket involving a negative multiplier, which is a fundamental algebraic skill. The reasoning focuses on the common student error of failing to distribute the negative sign to the second term inside the parentheses, a frequent misconception in early secondary education. Based on the provided calibration items, this type of algebraic manipulation typically yields moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
