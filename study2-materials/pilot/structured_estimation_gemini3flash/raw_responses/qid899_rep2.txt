The item assesses knowledge of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically identifying multiplication as having priority over addition and subtraction. While the calculation itself involves basic arithmetic, the conceptual hurdle is the common "left-to-right" misconception. Compared to the calibration examples, this item is more direct because it asks for the *first step* rather than the final result, which reduces the procedural steps but highlights the specific misconception. The distractors represent the most common errors in linear processing.
