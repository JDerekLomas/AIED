The item assesses the ability to solve a single-step linear equation involving fractions. The primary cognitive challenge lies in the division of a unit fraction by an integer, which often triggers misconceptions regarding whether to multiply or divide, and how to manipulate the denominator. Based on the calibration examples, items involving fractions and inverse operations typically exhibit moderate difficulty and high discrimination among secondary students.
