The item assesses the expansion of a quadratic expression with two negative constants. The reasoning focuses on the cognitive steps of the FOIL method, specifically the multiplication of negative integers and the subsequent addition of negative coefficients. The distractors are highly plausible as they systematically target sign errors in both the linear term and the constant term, which are common hurdles for students in the 11-16 age range.
