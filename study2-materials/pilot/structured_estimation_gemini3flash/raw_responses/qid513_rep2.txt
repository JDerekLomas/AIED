The target item asks students to evaluate two steps in solving a linear equation: $15 = 2p - 4$.
Step 1: $11 = 2p$ (The student subtracted 4 instead of adding 4; inverse operation error).
Step 2: $22 = p$ (The student multiplied by 2 instead of dividing by 2; inverse operation error).
Correct answer: D (Both are incorrect).

Comparing this to the calibration items:
- The first calibration item ($ -5 = p + 10 $) had a classical difficulty of 0.167. It was a one-step equation where the inverse operation error led to a distractor.
- The target item is more complex because it involves two steps and asks the student to *evaluate* someone else's work. This meta-cognitive step usually increases difficulty.
- However, the distractors are "Only step 1", "Only step 2", and "Both steps correct". If a student thinks even one step is correct because they share the misconception, they will get it wrong. 
- The misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" is tested twice here. 
- Step 1: $15 - 4 = 11$ (Incorrectly used subtraction).
- Step 2: $11 \times 2 = 22$ (Incorrectly used multiplication).
- Students who consistently apply the "same operation" rule will think both steps are correct (Option C). Students who only make the error once might choose A or B. 
- This item is likely to have a very low proportion correct (high difficulty) because it requires identifying *two* errors, and the "Both incorrect" option is often psychologically harder for students to select if they are unsure.

Looking at the calibration data:
- Equations items with inverse operation errors are consistently difficult (e.g., the first item at 0.167).
- The "Both incorrect" structure in diagnostic questions often yields low scores.
- I expect the IRT difficulty (b) to be around 0.0 to 0.5, and the classical difficulty to be low (around 0.20-0.25).
- Discrimination (a) should be moderate to high, similar to other algebra items (~1.2 - 1.4).
- Guessing (c) is likely low but not zero because students might guess D if they are totally lost.
