The item assesses the ability to rearrange the volume of a sphere formula to make the radius the subject. This requires multi-step algebraic manipulation, including multiplying by the reciprocal of a fraction, dividing by a constant, and taking a cube root. The use of variables and radical notation increases abstraction and cognitive load compared to numerical calculations. While the misconception identified is "same operation rather than inverse," the distractors primarily target common errors in algebraic transposition, such as incorrect placement of constants or failure to apply the root to the entire expression. Given the complexity of the formula and the abstract nature of the rearrangement, this item is likely to have a higher difficulty and lower success rate than simple linear equations.
