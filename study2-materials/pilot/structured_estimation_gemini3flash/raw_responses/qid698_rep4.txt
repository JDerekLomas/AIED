The item assesses the probability of independent events, requiring the multiplication of two basic probabilities ($1/4$ and $1/5$). The distractors are highly effective because they target common additive misconceptions: adding probabilities ($1/4 + 1/5 = 2/9$ or $9/20$) or adding denominators ($1/4 + 1/5 \rightarrow 1/9$). The visual representation is clear, and the mathematical operation is a standard part of the UK Key Stage 3 and 4 curriculum. Based on the calibration examples, items involving fractions and common misconceptions often show moderate difficulty but high discrimination.
