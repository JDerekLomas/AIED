The item assesses order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) using four integers and three operations. The primary error path involves left-to-right processing (18/2=9, 9+2=11, 11*2=22), which is represented by distractor C. Distractor A represents a different order error, while D might stem from a calculation slip. Given the calibration examples, order of operations questions often show high discrimination and moderate difficulty for this age group, as the misconception is persistent even when the arithmetic is simple.
