The item assesses the conversion of arithmetic operations into formal algebraic notation, specifically focusing on the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and fraction notation. The complexity is moderate as it requires identifying that the division symbol applies to the entire parenthetical expression and that the multiplication $a \times b$ should be written as $ab$. Option A is a strong distractor for students who ignore brackets, while Option D is a "near-miss" that fails the "algebraic convention" requirement despite being mathematically equivalent. Given the commonality of BIDMAS errors in the 11-16 age range, the item is expected to have a moderate difficulty level.
