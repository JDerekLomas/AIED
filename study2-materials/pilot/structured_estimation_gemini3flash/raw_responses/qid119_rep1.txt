The item tests the multiplication and division of negative integers, specifically the rule that a negative times/divided by a negative results in a positive.

1.  **Mathematical Content**: Tom claims $-3 \times -8 = -24$. This is incorrect; it should be $+24$. Katie claims $(-24) / -3 = -8$. This is also incorrect; it should be $+8$. Therefore, neither is correct (Option D).
2.  **Misconception Analysis**: The primary misconception is the belief that "a negative and a negative make a negative" (misapplying addition rules to multiplication or simply ignoring the sign change). This is a very common and persistent misconception in the UK Key Stage 3 (ages 11-14) curriculum.
3.  **Visual Elements**: The diagram shows an arrow of length -24 and a smaller arrow one-third the length. This visual representation is meant to ground the calculation, but for many students, it might add cognitive load or be ignored in favor of the algebraic statements provided by Tom and Katie.
4.  **Distractor Analysis**: 
    - Option A (Tom) is attractive to those who think negative $\times$ negative = negative.
    - Option B (Katie) is attractive for the same sign-rule error in division.
    - Option C (Both) is very attractive to students who consistently hold this sign-rule misconception.
    - Option D (Neither) requires the student to be confident enough to reject both plausible-looking statements.
5.  **Comparison with Calibration Items**: 
    - The "Tom and Katie" format in the fourth calibration item (factorising) had a classical difficulty of 0.473.
    - This item involves simpler arithmetic than quadratic factorising but targets a more fundamental and stubborn misconception. 
    - The "Neither" answer (Option D) is statistically harder for students to select than "Only A" or "Both", as they often assume one of the characters must be right. This should lower the proportion correct significantly.
    - Given the commonality of the error $-3 \times -8 = -24$, I expect a low proportion correct (high difficulty).
