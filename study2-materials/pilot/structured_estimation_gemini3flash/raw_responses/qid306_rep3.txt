The item assesses order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically comparing a situation where left-to-right evaluation is correct (addition/subtraction) against one where priority rules apply (multiplication over addition). The cognitive load is low as it asks for the first step rather than the final result, but it targets a very common misconception where students apply left-to-right rules universally or misinterpret the 'A' and 'S' in BIDMAS as addition always coming before subtraction.
