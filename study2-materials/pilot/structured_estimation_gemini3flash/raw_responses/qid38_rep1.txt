The item assesses the addition of algebraic fractions with different but related denominators. Students must identify a common denominator (2x), convert the second fraction (4/x to 8/2x), and then sum the numerators while maintaining the denominator. The distractors are strategically chosen: B targets adding both numerators and denominators (3+4/2x+x), D targets adding only the numerators without adjusting for the common denominator (3+4/2x), and C represents a potential simplification error or miscalculation. Based on the calibration examples, algebraic manipulation items for this age group often show moderate to high discrimination and difficulty parameters slightly above the mean, as the misconception of adding denominators is highly prevalent.
