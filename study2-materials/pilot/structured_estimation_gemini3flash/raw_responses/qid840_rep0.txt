The item assesses the ability to identify valid intermediate steps in solving a linear equation involving fractions. Tom's error stems from a common misconception where the student performs the same operation (division by 5) on the right side instead of the inverse (multiplication). Katie's step involves a correct division of both sides by 8, which is a less common but valid first step compared to the standard multiplication by 5. The comparative nature of the question ("Who is correct?") increases the cognitive load and requires evaluating two separate logical paths, making it more difficult than a standard "solve for x" question.
