The item assesses order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with negative number arithmetic. The primary distractor (B) targets the common misconception of performing operations from left to right, while (A) and (C) address errors in directed number arithmetic. Based on the provided calibration examples for similar arithmetic and order-of-operation items, this question is expected to have a low proportion correct due to the compounding difficulty of negative signs and the commonality of the left-to-right error.
