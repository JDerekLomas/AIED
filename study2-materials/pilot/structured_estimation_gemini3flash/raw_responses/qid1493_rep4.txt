The item tests the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEMDAS), specifically prioritizing indices (Exponents) over division and subtraction. 
- Concept Complexity: Low. It's a fundamental arithmetic rule.
- Procedural Steps: Very low. The student doesn't have to calculate the final answer, only identify the first step.
- Distractor Plausibility: Option C (8-7) is a very strong distractor for students who work left-to-right. Option B (7/6) is plausible for those who know MD/AS but forget indices come first.
- Misconception: The "left-to-right" misconception is extremely common in UK Year 7 and 8 (ages 11-13).
- Comparison with Calibrated Items: 
    - The second calibration item (0.4 - 1/5 * 3) had a classical difficulty of 0.134, but that required a full calculation with fractions and decimals. 
    - This target item is much simpler because it only asks for the *first step*. 
    - However, the presence of an index ($6^3$) often confuses students more than simple multiplication.
- Psychometric Prediction: Because it asks for the first step rather than the final value, the success rate will be higher than the multi-step calculation item. However, the misconception (left-to-right) is very potent. I expect a moderate difficulty but high discrimination because it's a "know it or you don't" question.
- Guessing: Since it's a 4-choice question and "It doesn't matter" is a weak distractor, the effective guessing rate is low.
