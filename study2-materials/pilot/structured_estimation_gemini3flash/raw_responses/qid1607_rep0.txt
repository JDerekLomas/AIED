The item assesses the ability to identify errors in a multi-step algebraic solution, specifically focusing on the inverse operation principle. I evaluated the cognitive load required to verify each step and compared the complexity of this "error analysis" format against standard "solve for x" items. My reasoning considers the commonality of the "same operation instead of inverse" misconception (adding 1 instead of subtracting 1) and how the multiple-choice structure influences the probability of guessing.
