The item assesses a fundamental rule of arithmetic within an algebraic context: multiplying two negative constants. The visual representation (arrows) simplifies the task by isolating the specific terms, reducing the procedural steps to a single operation. The primary challenge lies in the common misconception regarding the product of two negative numbers, while distractors also account for additive errors. Given the simplicity of the single-step calculation and the clear visual aid, the item is expected to have a relatively high success rate among secondary students, though the specific misconception remains a persistent hurdle.
