The item tests a very specific and notorious nuance of mathematical notation and order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS): the distinction between $-6^2$ and $(-6)^2$. 

Mathematically, $-6^2$ is interpreted as $-(6 \times 6) = -36$ because indices take priority over the unary minus (which is treated as multiplication by $-1$). However, the vast majority of students (and even many adults) intuitively believe that the negative sign is "attached" to the number being squared, leading them to the answer $36$.

Distractor Analysis:
- A (12) and B (-12): These attract students who confuse squaring with multiplying by 2.
- C (36): This is the primary distractor. It represents the "standard" misconception that squaring any negative number results in a positive, ignoring the order of operations regarding the minus sign.
- D (-36): The correct answer.

Psychometric considerations: 
Looking at the calibration items, items involving order of operations (like the $0.4 - 1/5 \times 3$ example) tend to have very low classical difficulty (proportion correct around 0.13-0.16) because the misconception is "stronger" than random guessing. In the calibration set, the IRT difficulty (b) for the BIDMAS question was -0.245, but its proportion correct was only 0.134, suggesting the distractors are highly functional. 

For $-6^2$, the misconception is extremely prevalent. I expect a very low proportion correct, likely lower than the chance level (0.25), because the "logical" but incorrect path to 36 is so tempting. This will result in a negative b-parameter in a 2PL model (because lower-ability students are actively drawn to a specific wrong answer) and a high discrimination.
