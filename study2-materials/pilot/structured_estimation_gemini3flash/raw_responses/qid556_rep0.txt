The item assesses the fundamental algebraic concept of inverse operations, specifically the transition from $9y$ to $y$. The visual representation using a "star" to denote an operation is a common pedagogical tool in UK secondary schools (Key Stage 3). While the concept is foundational, the misconception of using the same operation (subtraction instead of division) is a persistent error among lower-attainment students. Comparing this to the calibration items, it is more straightforward than the inequality or function machine questions, suggesting a lower IRT difficulty and higher classical success rate.
