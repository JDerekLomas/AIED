The item requires students to rearrange a linear equation from the form ax + by = c to y = mx + c to identify the gradient. This involves multi-step algebraic manipulation, specifically subtracting the x-term and dividing by the coefficient of y. The identified misconception (using the same operation rather than the inverse) is highly relevant here, as students frequently fail to change signs when moving terms or forget to divide the entire expression. The distractors are strong, targeting common errors such as simply picking the coefficient of x or failing to divide by 3. Given the curriculum level for UK secondary students, this is a moderately difficult task requiring solid procedural fluency.
