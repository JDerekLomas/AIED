The item assesses addition of mixed numbers with unequal denominators, a core skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The process involves identifying a common denominator (20), converting the fractional parts, adding the integer and fractional components, and potentially simplifying or converting improper fractions. The primary misconception (Option D) involving adding numerators and denominators is a highly prevalent error in this age group, increasing the plausibility of distractors. The cognitive load is moderate due to the multi-step nature of the procedure, while the clarity is high as it follows a standard textbook format.
