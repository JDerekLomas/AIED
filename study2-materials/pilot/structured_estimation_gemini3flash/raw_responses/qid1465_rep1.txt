The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically focusing on the priority of multiplication over addition and subtraction, and the left-to-right processing of equal-priority operators. I evaluated the number of operations (three), the commonality of the "left-to-right" misconception which leads to distractors B and C, and the clarity of the presentation. Compared to the calibration items, this item is more straightforward than the inequalities or factorizing questions but contains strong distractors that frequently catch students who lack procedural fluency in order of operations.
