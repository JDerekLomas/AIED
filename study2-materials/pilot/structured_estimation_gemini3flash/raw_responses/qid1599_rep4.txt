The item assesses the fundamental transition from arithmetic division notation to algebraic fraction notation. The concept is foundational but requires students to recognize the grouping effect of the vinculum. While the procedural steps are minimal, the abstraction lies in interpreting parentheses and the position of variables. The distractors are highly plausible, particularly for students who struggle with the order of operations or the reciprocal relationship in division. Given the calibration examples, this item is likely to have a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination, as it targets a specific, common misconception in early algebra.
