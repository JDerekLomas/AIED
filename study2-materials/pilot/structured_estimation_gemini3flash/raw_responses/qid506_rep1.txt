The item assesses the ability to solve a single-step linear equation involving fractions. Reasoning involves recognizing the inverse operation of multiplication (division) and applying it to a unit fraction, which tests the student's proficiency with fraction arithmetic. Distractors are strategically designed to capture common errors, such as multiplying the coefficient by the denominator or misapplying the inverse operation.
