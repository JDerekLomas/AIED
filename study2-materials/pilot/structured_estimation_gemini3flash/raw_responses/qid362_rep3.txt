The item assesses the ability to rearrange a linear equation from the form ax + by = c into the gradient-intercept form y = mx + c. This requires understanding the concept of a gradient and performing multiple algebraic manipulations involving inverse operations. The distractors are highly plausible as they represent common errors: taking the coefficient of x without rearranging (4), failing to divide by the coefficient of y (-4), or forgetting the sign change during subtraction (4/3). Given that many students struggle with multi-step algebraic rearrangement and the specific sign changes involved, the difficulty is expected to be moderate to high.
