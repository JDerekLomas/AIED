The item assesses a single, specific component of binomial expansion: multiplying two negative integers. The visual aid of arrows reduces the cognitive load by isolating the required operation, but the presence of common additive errors (-10, -6) and sign errors (-16) provides strong distractors. Based on the provided calibration items, particularly the factorizing question involving similar sign rules, this item is likely to have moderate difficulty and high discrimination as it targets a fundamental misconception regarding negative numbers.
