The item assesses the ability to substitute a value into a linear nth-term formula involving a negative coefficient. The process requires multiplying 3 by 15 and then subtracting that product from 1. The distractors are strategically chosen: -46 results from a common subtraction error or sign confusion, -14 stems from the specific misconception of ignoring order of operations (calculating 1 minus 3 first), and -30 likely targets a partial calculation or misinterpretation of the variable. Given the simplicity of the substitution but the commonality of negative number errors in this age group, the difficulty is expected to be moderate with a healthy discrimination factor.
