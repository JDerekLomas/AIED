The item assesses the understanding of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the hierarchy of multiplication over addition and the left-to-right rule for addition and subtraction. The cognitive load is low as it focuses on identifying the first step rather than the final result, but it targets a persistent misconception where students apply a strict left-to-right rule or incorrectly prioritize addition over subtraction. Comparison with the calibration examples suggest a moderate difficulty level due to the common nature of the misconception in the 11-16 age range.
