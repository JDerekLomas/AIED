The item assesses the ability to substitute a value into a linear sequence formula involving negative coefficients. The reasoning involves evaluating the complexity of the substitution $1 - 3(15)$, identifying common errors such as order of operations or sign errors, and comparing the distractors ($14$, $-46$, $-30$) to these likely mistakes. The difficulty is likely moderate for the age group due to the negative result and the potential for a BODMAS error where a student might calculate $(1-3) \times 15$.
