The item assesses the expansion of a squared binomial, a core algebraic skill in the UK secondary curriculum. The reasoning evaluates the complexity of the "difference of squares" misconception versus the "sign error" in the constant term. I have estimated the parameters by comparing the cognitive load of this task—which requires FOIL or grid methods—against the provided calibration items, noting that binomial expansion typically shows higher discrimination but also high rates of common misconceptions.
