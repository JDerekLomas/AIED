The item assesses quadratic factorization, a standard GCSE-level skill for UK students. It requires finding two numbers that multiply to -6 and add to -1, necessitating an understanding of negative number arithmetic and distributive property expansion. The distractors are highly plausible because they represent common sign errors and systematic misconceptions regarding the product of signs. Based on the provided calibration examples, this item is slightly more difficult than basic linear equations but follows a very standard format, leading to a moderate discrimination value and a difficulty parameter typically found in the middle of the secondary school ability range.
