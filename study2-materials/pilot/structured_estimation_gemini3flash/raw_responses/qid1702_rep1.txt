The item requires substituting a decimal value into a linear equation and solving for the unknown variable. My reasoning involves evaluating the complexity of the algebraic manipulation (multi-step linear equation), the cognitive load of handling negative signs and decimals simultaneously, and the specific distractors which target common arithmetic and inverse operation errors.
