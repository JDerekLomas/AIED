The item assesses the ability to rearrange the sphere volume formula to make the radius the subject. This involves multiple algebraic steps: multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction 4/3, dividing by pi, and taking the cube root. The complexity is moderate as it requires handling both fractional coefficients and irrational constants in an abstract, literal equation context. Distractors target common errors in algebraic manipulation, such as inverted fractions or incorrect operation order, which are frequent at the GCSE level (ages 14-16).
