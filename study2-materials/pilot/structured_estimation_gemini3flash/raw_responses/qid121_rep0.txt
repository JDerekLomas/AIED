The item requires students to rearrange a linear equation from the form $ax + by = c$ to $y = mx + c$ to identify the gradient. This involves identifying the role of the coefficient of $x$ and the necessity of isolating $y$, which entails multiple algebraic steps including subtraction and division. The distractors are highly plausible, targeting common errors such as identifying the coefficient of $x$ directly without rearranging or failing to apply inverse operations correctly to signs. Based on the provided calibration items, this problem is more complex than simple one-step equations but follows a standard curriculum pattern for higher-tier GCSE preparation.
