The item assesses quadratic factorisation, a standard GCSE-level topic (ages 14-16). It requires finding factors of -6 that sum to -1. The cognitive demand involves simultaneous consideration of multiplicative and additive properties of integers. Distractors target common sign errors and misconceptions regarding the product of directed numbers. Based on the calibration items, particularly the one involving Tom and Katie's factorisation, this item is slightly more direct but carries a similar level of conceptual difficulty related to negative number arithmetic.
