The item assesses the ability to determine the gradient of a linear equation presented in the implicit form $ax + by = c$. This requires students to rearrange the equation into the explicit form $y = mx + c$, involving two distinct algebraic steps: subtracting $5x$ and dividing by $3$. The primary misconception involves sign errors during the subtraction (resulting in $5/3$) or simply identifying the coefficient of $x$ without rearranging. Given that this is a multi-step algebraic manipulation, it typically presents a higher level of difficulty for the 11-16 age range compared to basic linear equations.
