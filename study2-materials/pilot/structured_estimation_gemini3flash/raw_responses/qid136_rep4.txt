The item assesses basic multiplication of directed numbers, specifically the rule that a negative product requires one positive and one negative factor. The concept is fundamental in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum, making it highly age-appropriate but low in complexity. Distractors target common errors: Option A tests the "two negatives make a negative" misconception, Option C tests additive thinking, and Option D tests a calculation error. The simplicity of the prompt and the single-step nature of the verification process suggest a high success rate and low cognitive load.
