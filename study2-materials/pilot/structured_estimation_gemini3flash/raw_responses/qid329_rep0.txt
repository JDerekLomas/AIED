The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically regarding the priority of division over subtraction. It also tests the understanding of commutativity in subtraction, which is a common area of confusion. Based on the calibration examples, items involving decimals and order of operations tend to have low classical difficulty due to the prevalence of left-to-right processing misconceptions. The comparison between two people's statements adds a layer of evaluation, though the notation is standard. I expect a moderate discrimination parameter and a low guessing probability as the distractors align closely with specific conceptual errors.
