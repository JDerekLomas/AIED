The item assesses the application of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically involving negative integers. To solve correctly, the student must prioritize multiplication over addition, calculating -5 × 3 = -15, then -4 + (-15) = -19. The primary misconception involves left-to-right processing, which leads to -4 + (-5) = -9, then -9 × 3 = -27. This is a common error in the UK secondary curriculum (KS3/KS4). Based on the calibration examples for similar order-of-operation and directed number tasks, the item is expected to have a low proportion correct and a negative IRT difficulty, as many students at lower ability levels consistently apply the incorrect left-to-right heuristic.
