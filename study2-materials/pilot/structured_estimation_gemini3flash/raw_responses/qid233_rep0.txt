The item assesses the conversion of arithmetic operations into formal algebraic notation, specifically focusing on the division bar as a grouping symbol and the omission of the multiplication sign. The cognitive demand involves recognizing that the denominator must encompass the entire expression following the division sign, while also identifying the correct convention for variable multiplication. Distractors A and B capitalize on common order-of-operations errors and misinterpretation of grouping, while D tests the specific convention of removing the multiplication operator. Based on the provided calibration items, this conceptual translation task typically falls in the middle range of difficulty for the target age group.
