The item assesses the fundamental understanding of algebraic notation and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The core task is to recognize that juxtaposition in algebra signifies multiplication and that this operation takes precedence over addition. The distractors are well-aligned with the common misconception of reading mathematical expressions from left to right, particularly distractors C and D which suggest adding 3 before multiplying. This is a foundational concept for the lower end of the 11-16 age range (Key Stage 3). Given the simplicity of the expression but the high prevalence of order-of-operation errors, the item is expected to have a moderate difficulty level and a high discrimination power, as it clearly separates students who understand algebraic structure from those who rely on linear reading strategies.
