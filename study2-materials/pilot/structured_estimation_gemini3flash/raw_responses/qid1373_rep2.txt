The item assesses the expansion of a single bracket involving a negative multiplier and a negative term within the expression. The primary cognitive challenge lies in the application of sign rules, specifically the product of two negative numbers. Based on the provided calibration examples, items involving sign errors and basic algebraic manipulation typically show moderate difficulty and high discrimination among secondary school students. The distractors are highly plausible as they represent common errors in sign management and term distribution.
