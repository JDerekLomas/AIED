The item assesses the most fundamental aspect of fraction arithmetic: adding fractions with common denominators. The cognitive demand is low as it requires a single-step addition of numerators while maintaining the denominator. The primary distractor (D) targets the highly prevalent misconception of adding denominators, which is a common error among lower-attaining students in the 11-16 age range. Given the simplicity of the arithmetic and the standard presentation, the classical difficulty is expected to be high (meaning many students will get it right), resulting in a low IRT difficulty parameter. Discrimination is expected to be moderate to high because the distinction between those who understand fraction addition and those who apply "add across" rules is usually quite sharp.
