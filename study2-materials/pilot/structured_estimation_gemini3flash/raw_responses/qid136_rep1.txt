The item assesses integer multiplication and the specific misconception regarding the sign of the product of two negative numbers. The question is structurally simple and fits the lower end of the 11-16 age range curriculum. The distractors target common errors: Option A tests the negative-negative misconception, Option C targets additive thinking, and Option D targets a misunderstanding of "product" or simple arithmetic error. Comparing this to the calibration examples, the cognitive load is low, and the discrimination is likely to be high because the misconception is a very specific barrier to the correct answer.
