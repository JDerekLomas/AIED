The item assesses basic algebraic notation, specifically the conversion of a division expression involving a binomial divisor into fraction form. I evaluated the simplicity of the single-step operation against the common student error of misapplying the order of operations or incorrectly positioning terms in a fraction. Given the clarity of the prompt and its direct alignment with the Key Stage 3 curriculum, the difficulty is expected to be relatively low, with high discrimination between students who understand algebraic structure and those who rely on linear left-to-right processing.
