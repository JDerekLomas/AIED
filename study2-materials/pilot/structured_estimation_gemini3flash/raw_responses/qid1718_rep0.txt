The item assesses binomial expansion of a squared term involving a negative value, specifically targeting the common student error of incorrectly squaring the constant term. My reasoning evaluates the complexity of the algebraic manipulation required against typical performance data for UK secondary students, noting that squaring a binomial is a standard but frequently botched procedure due to sign errors and the omission of the middle term. I compared this to the provided calibration items to estimate difficulty and discrimination parameters based on the high plausibility of the distractors.
