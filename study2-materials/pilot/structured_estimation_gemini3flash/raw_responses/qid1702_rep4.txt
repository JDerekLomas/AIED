The item assesses the ability to substitute a decimal value into a linear equation with two variables and solve for the remaining variable. The reasoning involves identifying the correct substitution ($y = 0.5$), performing the multiplication ($6 \times 0.5 = 3$), and then correctly applying inverse operations ($10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$). The presence of the "inverse operation" misconception suggests students might subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding, or struggle with the decimal division, leading to the selection of distractors like 2.7. The tabular format adds a slight layer of abstraction compared to a direct "solve for x" prompt.
