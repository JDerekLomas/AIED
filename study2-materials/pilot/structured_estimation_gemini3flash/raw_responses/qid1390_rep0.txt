The item assesses order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically involving fractions. To solve it correctly, students must perform the multiplication ($1/2 \times 1/3 = 1/6$) before the addition ($1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2$). The primary misconception (Option B) involves a left-to-right calculation ($1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6$, then $5/6 \times 1/3 = 5/18$), which is a highly common error in this age group. Other distractors represent common fraction arithmetic errors, such as adding numerators and denominators (Option C: $2/9$ from $1/3+1/2=2/5$ then $2/5 \times 1/3$). Based on the calibration examples, items involving order of operations and fractions typically show low classical difficulty (proportion correct) because the distractors are very attractive to students with procedural gaps.
