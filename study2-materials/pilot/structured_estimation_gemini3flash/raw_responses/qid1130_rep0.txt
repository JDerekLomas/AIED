The item requires the student to integrate geometric knowledge (angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees) with algebraic manipulation (combining like terms and solving a linear equation). The cognitive demand involves setting up the equation $(4x) + (2x - 12) + (4x + 42) = 180$, simplifying it to $10x + 30 = 180$, and solving for $x$. Distractors likely target arithmetic errors or the specific misconception of using incorrect operations during the inverse process (e.g., subtracting 30 instead of adding, or vice-versa). Based on the calibration examples, multi-step algebraic problems for this age group typically show moderate IRT difficulty and discrimination, with guessing play a significant role as complexity increases.
