<chain_of_thought>
The item assesses knowledge of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically identifying the innermost grouping as the starting point. I analyzed the complexity of the nested brackets against the common misconception of left-to-right processing. The item is conceptually straightforward but requires careful parsing of notation, leading to a prediction of moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
