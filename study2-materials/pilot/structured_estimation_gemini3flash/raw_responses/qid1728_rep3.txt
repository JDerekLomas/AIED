The item evaluates the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically within the context of fraction arithmetic. Students must correctly prioritize the multiplication of 1/4 and 1/5 before performing subtraction from 3/4, which requires finding a common denominator (20). The primary misconception involves left-to-right processing, leading to (3/4 - 1/4) * 1/5 = 1/10. Because this error leads directly to a plausible distractor and involves multiple steps of fraction manipulation, the item is expected to have a relatively high difficulty level and strong discrimination power similar to the second calibration example.
