The item assesses the foundational algebraic concept of inverse operations within the context of solving a one-step linear equation. While the mathematical operation is simple (subtracting 7 to isolate x), the item uses a slightly non-standard visual representation (flow/working notation) which adds a minor layer of interpretation. The misconception being tested—using the same operation rather than the inverse—is a highly common error for students at the lower end of the 11-16 age range, making the distractors particularly effective for that cohort. Based on the calibration items, questions involving basic inverse operations often show high discrimination and low guessing parameters, as they target a specific, binary understanding of algebraic rules.
