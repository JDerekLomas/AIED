The item involves algebraic fraction addition, which combines fraction arithmetic with algebraic manipulation. The student must identify a common denominator (2x), find an equivalent fraction for 4/x (8/2x), and then sum the numerators. The distractors target common errors: B represents adding both numerators and denominators (3+4 over 2x+x), D represents adding numerators but keeping one denominator part (3+4 over 2x), and C represents a potential error in scaling the denominator. Based on the calibration examples, algebraic manipulation tasks in this curriculum often show moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
