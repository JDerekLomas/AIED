The item assesses fraction addition with unequal denominators (3/5 and 1/4). The primary misconception (Option A: 4/9) involves adding numerators and denominators directly, which is a highly prevalent error among UK secondary students. The procedural steps involve finding a common denominator, converting numerators, and summing them. While the visual representation is slightly non-standard (a "number pyramid" style), the underlying concept is a fundamental part of the Key Stage 3 curriculum. Given the strength of the distractors, particularly the "add across" error, the difficulty is expected to be moderate to high.
