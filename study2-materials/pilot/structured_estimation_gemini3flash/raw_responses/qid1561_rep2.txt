The item involves a standard two-step linear equation requiring an addition and a division. While the operations are basic, the result is a fraction, which typically increases difficulty for students in this age range compared to integer results. The distractors effectively target common errors: sign errors (Option D), and the "division order" misconception where students divide the larger number by the smaller number regardless of algebraic structure (Options B and C). Based on the calibration items, two-step equations with fractional outcomes tend to sit in the middle of the difficulty spectrum for this population.
