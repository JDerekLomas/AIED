The question asks for the value of \((-2)^4\). 
- **Mathematical concepts**: Negative numbers, exponents (indices), and the rule that an even power of a negative number results in a positive product.
- **Procedural steps**: Either calculating \((-2) \times (-2) \times (-2) \times (-2)\) or recognizing \(2^4 = 16\) and determining the sign.
- **Distractors**: 
    - A) \(-16\): The most common error, where students apply the exponent to the magnitude but keep the negative sign (often confusing \((-2)^4\) with \(-2^4\)).
    - B) \(-8\): Multiplication error (\(-2 \times 4\)).
    - D) \(8\): Multiplication error (\(2 \times 4\)) or forgetting the exponent rules.
- **Difficulty analysis**: This is a classic "trap" question in the UK curriculum (Key Stage 3/4). While the calculation is simple, the sign rule is a major hurdle. Looking at the calibration items, items involving negative number rules often have high discrimination because they separate students who understand the formal rules from those who apply heuristics.
- **Comparison**: Compared to \(0.4 - 1/5 \times 3\) (Difficulty 0.134), this is slightly more straightforward but shares the "order of operations/notation" pitfall. Compared to the factorising question (Difficulty 0.473), this is more focused on a single arithmetic property. 
- **Psychometric profile**: I expect a relatively low classical difficulty (around 0.35-0.45) because many students instinctively choose \(-16\). The discrimination will likely be high as it's a binary "know it or don't" concept.
