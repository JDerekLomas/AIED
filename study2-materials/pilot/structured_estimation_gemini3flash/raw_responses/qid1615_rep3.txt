The item assesses the ability to translate a word problem into a formal algebraic equation, specifically testing the correct use of grouping symbols or fraction bars to represent the order of operations. The core challenge lies in distinguishing between the sequential operations described ("take away six and then divide") and the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), which would prioritize division over subtraction without grouping. Distractor B is highly plausible for students who translate word-for-word without considering operator precedence, while Distractor D represents a misinterpretation of which term is divided. Given the calibration examples, this item sits at a moderate difficulty level for the target age group, as it requires conceptual translation rather than just procedural computation.
