The item assesses the ability to identify errors in a two-step linear equation involving division and addition. Step 1 is correct (multiplication by 4), while Step 2 contains a common error where the student adds 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it (inverse operation error). This specific misconception is highly prevalent in the 11-16 age range. The format requires evaluating a student's work, which adds a layer of cognitive load compared to simply solving the equation. Based on the calibration items, inverse operation errors typically result in moderate IRT difficulty and relatively high discrimination.
