The item evaluates the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of indices over multiplication. The calculation requires squaring 3 first to get 9, then multiplying by 2 to reach 18. Common errors involve multiplying 2 and 3 first (resulting in 6 squared, 36) or treating the index as a multiplier (2 times 3 times 2, resulting in 12). These distractors are highly plausible for students with weak procedural fluency in arithmetic. Given the simplicity of the notation and the foundational nature of the topic for the 11-16 age range, the item is expected to have high clarity but significant distraction power for lower-ability students.
