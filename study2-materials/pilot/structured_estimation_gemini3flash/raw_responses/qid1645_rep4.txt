The item assesses the ability to solve a two-step quadratic equation involving subtraction, division, and finding square roots. The complexity is moderate as it requires isolating the squared term before considering both positive and negative roots. The distractors are designed to catch common arithmetic errors or the failure to correctly apply inverse operations, specifically relating to the square root of 10. The notation is standard for UK secondary school students, and the presence of "n" in option A serves as a minor clerical distractor.
