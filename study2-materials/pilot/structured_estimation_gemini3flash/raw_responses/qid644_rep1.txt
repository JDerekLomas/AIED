The item assesses a fundamental rule of arithmetic within an algebraic context: the multiplication of two negative integers. The visual representation using arrows simplifies the procedural demand by isolating a single step of the FOIL/grid method, reducing cognitive load and focusing specifically on the misconception that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a negative. Given the simplicity of the single-step operation and the clear visual cues, the item is expected to have a relatively high success rate among the target age group, though the commonality of the sign error will provide moderate discrimination.
