The item assesses a single, specific step within the process of expanding binomials: multiplying two negative constants. I evaluated the cognitive load as low due to the visual aid (arrows) which isolates the required operation, reducing the need for students to navigate the full FOIL/grid method. The primary challenge lies in the application of integer multiplication rules rather than algebraic manipulation. Based on the calibration items, particularly the factorising example which shares the same misconception, I expect a moderate level of difficulty but high discrimination, as the distinction between a positive and negative product is a binary conceptual threshold for students at this level.
