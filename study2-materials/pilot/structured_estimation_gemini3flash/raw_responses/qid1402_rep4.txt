The item assesses basic algebraic notation and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The expression $3 + ab$ requires the student to recognize that multiplication ($ab$) takes precedence over addition. The distractors are designed to capture students who read the expression linearly from left to right or misunderstand the implicit multiplication in algebraic juxtaposition. Given that this is a fundamental concept for 11-13 year olds but remains a common stumbling block for older students, the difficulty is expected to be moderate with a high discrimination factor, as it clearly separates those who understand algebraic priority from those who do not.
