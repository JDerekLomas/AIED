The item assesses the ability to solve a linear equation where the unknown is in the denominator. This structure is a known "pivot point" in algebra that triggers misconceptions related to inverse operations (multiplying vs. dividing) and commutativity. Students often incorrectly apply a "big number divided by small number" heuristic or multiply the two visible constants. The distractors effectively capture these errors (50 from $10 \times 5$, 2 from $10 \div 5$). Given the calibration data for similar one-step equations, this item is likely to have a lower classical difficulty than simple additive equations due to the fractional structure.
