The item assesses the ability to translate a concrete visual representation (cups and counters) into formal algebraic notation and solve it. The visual model explicitly shows the subtraction of terms from both sides (removing one cup from both sides, then two counters from both sides), which maps directly to the steps of solving $x+4=2x+2$. Distractors target common errors such as adding coefficients and constants ($x+2x$ and $4+2$) instead of performing inverse operations. The item has a moderate cognitive load due to the dual-task of translation and calculation, but the visual scaffolding provides significant support, likely resulting in a higher success rate compared to purely abstract algebraic questions.
