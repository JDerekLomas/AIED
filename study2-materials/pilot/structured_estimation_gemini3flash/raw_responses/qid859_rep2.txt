The item involves solving a linear equation with variables on both sides, which is a standard secondary school topic. The reasoning process identifies that students must perform two main operations: isolating the variable by subtracting $6d$ and isolating the constant by adding $3$. Common errors arise from using the same operation instead of the inverse (e.g., $12d + 6d$ or $3 - 3$), leading to the specific distractors provided. The cognitive demand is moderate as it requires multiple steps, but the notation is standard and clear.
