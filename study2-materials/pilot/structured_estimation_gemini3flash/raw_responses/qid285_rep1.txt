The item assesses the ability to rearrange a formula involving a square term. This requires two distinct procedural steps: division by a coefficient and taking the square root. The use of Greek notation ($\omega$) increases the abstraction level and may slightly increase cognitive load for students accustomed to $x$ or $y$. The distractors target common algebraic errors, such as multiplying instead of dividing or applying the square root incorrectly. Based on the provided calibration items, rearranging formulas typically presents a higher IRT difficulty than basic linear equations but maintains a similar discrimination profile.
