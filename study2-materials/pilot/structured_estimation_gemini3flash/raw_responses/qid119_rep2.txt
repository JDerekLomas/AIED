The item assesses integer arithmetic (multiplication and division of negative numbers) and the ability to interpret a visual representation (vector/number line diagram).

1. **Content Analysis**: The core math is $(-3) \times (-8) = 24$ and $(-24) \div (-3) = 8$. Both Tom and Katie claim the result is negative ($ -24$ and $-8$). The correct answer is D (Neither), because a negative times/divided by a negative is a positive.
2. **Misconception**: The misconception "multiplying two negatives gives a negative" is very strong in the 11-14 age range. Students often overgeneralize the rule for "a negative and a positive" or confuse the rules for addition of negatives with multiplication.
3. **Diagrammatic Complexity**: The diagram shows an arrow of length 24 pointing left (representing -24) and a smaller arrow one-third the length pointing left. This is intended to ground the calculation, but for many students, the diagram might be confusing or ignored in favor of the symbolic expressions. The fact that the arrows point *left* might actually reinforce the misconception that the result should be negative.
4. **Comparison with Calibration Items**: 
   - Item 4 (Tom/Katie on factorising) had a classical difficulty of 0.473 and $b=0.404$. That item required expanding or factorising. 
   - This item is slightly more abstract because of the "Neither" option and the diagram. "Neither" and "Both" options in Tom/Katie formats often lower the success rate compared to simple calculations because students feel pressure to pick one person.
   - The misconception is fundamental. Many students will see $-3 \times -8$ and instinctively think $-24$.
5. **Psychometric Estimation**: 
   - The proportion correct is likely lower than 0.5 because "Neither" is a difficult choice for students who have a partial grasp of the rules. 
   - Discrimination is likely high (around 1.3-1.5) as it clearly separates those who know the sign rules from those who don't.
   - Guessing is likely lower than 0.25 because the distractors (A, B, C) are highly attractive based on the specific misconception.
