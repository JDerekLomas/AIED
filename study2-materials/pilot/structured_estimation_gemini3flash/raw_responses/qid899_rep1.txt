The item assesses the fundamental order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of multiplication over addition and subtraction. While the calculation itself is simple, the question asks for the "first step," which directly targets the common misconception of processing expressions from left to right. Given the calibration examples, items involving order of operations often show low classical difficulty because the left-to-right error is highly prevalent among lower-ability students. The clarity is high, but the strength of the misconception significantly impacts the proportion correct.
