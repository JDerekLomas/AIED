The item tests the evaluation of a negative integer raised to an even power: \((-2)^4\). 
- Mathematical steps: \((-2) \times (-2) \times (-2) \times (-2)\).
- Key concept 1: Understanding exponentiation (repeated multiplication).
- Key concept 2: Rules for multiplying negative numbers (an even number of negatives results in a positive).
- Distractor Analysis:
    - A) -16: Correct magnitude, but ignores the sign rule (common error where students think the negative sign stays regardless of the power, or confuse \((-2)^4\) with \(-2^4\)).
    - B) -8: Arithmetic error (multiplying base by exponent: \(-2 \times 4\)).
    - D) 8: Arithmetic error (ignoring the negative and multiplying base by exponent: \(2 \times 4\)).
- Comparison with calibration items: This is more fundamental than solving linear inequalities (Item 5) but targets a very specific, persistent misconception. The misconception "multiplying two negatives gives a negative" is highly prevalent.
- Psychometric expectation: Similar to Item 4 (factorising), students often struggle with the sign rules. However, the calculation is simpler here. The "proportion correct" is likely to be lower than one might expect for such a short question because the distractor -16 is extremely attractive to students who have been taught that "a power of a negative is negative" or who use calculators incorrectly.
