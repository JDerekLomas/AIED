The item assesses the ability to solve linear inequalities with variables on both sides. Reasoning involves comparing this item to the provided calibration example "2n + 3 ≤ 3n - 7", noting the structural similarity but slightly different arithmetic requirements. Evaluation of distractors identifies common errors such as incorrect inverse operations (adding 5 to 2 to get 7) or sign errors when manipulating terms across the inequality. The cognitive load is moderate due to the need to maintain the inequality sign direction while isolating the variable.
