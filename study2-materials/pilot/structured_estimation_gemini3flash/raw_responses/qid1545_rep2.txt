The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) by comparing a standard expression to one containing parentheses. To solve it, a student must calculate the left side (11) and the right side (5) separately. The primary misconception involves performing operations from left to right (calculating $20 \div 4 = 5$ on both sides), which leads to the incorrect conclusion that the expressions are equal. Given the calibration examples, this type of arithmetic order-of-operations error is common but often results in a relatively high difficulty because it targets a fundamental procedural misunderstanding.
