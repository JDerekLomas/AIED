The item assesses the commutative and associative properties of addition and multiplication within the context of the order of operations. The reasoning involves evaluating two statements: Tom's statement regarding the equivalence of addition and subtraction order, and Katie's statement regarding the commutativity of addition when combined with multiplication. I will evaluate the cognitive load required to verify both identities and the likelihood of students incorrectly applying "left-to-right" rules or misinterpreting operator precedence.
