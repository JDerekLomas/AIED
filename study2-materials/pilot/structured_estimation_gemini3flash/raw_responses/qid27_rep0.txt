The item tests substitution into a linear expression with a negative variable value. 
Calculation: $10 - 2(-2) = 10 - (-4) = 10 + 4 = 14$.

Distractor Analysis:
- A) $-12$: Likely from $10 - 2 = 8$, then $8 \times -2 = -16$ (misorder), or more likely $10 - 2(-2)$ where they treat it as $-(10 + 4)$ or a combination of sign errors like $-2 - 10$.
- B) $6$: $10 - 4 = 6$. This is the "multiplying two negatives gives a negative" error ($10 + (-4) = 6$). This is a very common mistake for UK students in Key Stage 3 and 4.
- D) $32$: Likely from treating $2d$ as $2$ followed by the digit $-2$ (concatenation) or $10 - 2 = 8$, then $8 \times (-2)$? Less clear, but often stems from $10 - 2 = 8$, then $8 \times 4$? 32 is a common "distractor" in these sets for students who perform operations in the wrong order or misinterpret notation.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The first item ($-5 = p + 10$) had a very low classical difficulty (0.167) and a negative IRT difficulty.
- This item is more straightforward than the fraction/decimal one (0.134) but the negative sign in substitution is a notorious "killer" for mid-ability students.
- The misconception "multiplying two negatives gives a negative" is specifically identified. 
- I expect a classical difficulty around 0.35 - 0.45. It is easier than the complex fraction item but harder than the inequality item for many.
- Discrimination (a) is usually high for these algebraic substitution items as they clearly separate those who understand directed numbers from those who don't.
