The item tests the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the strategic use of brackets. 
The core task is to evaluate four different expressions to find which one equals 7.
- A: $16 - (10) \div 2 = 16 - 5 = 11$
- B: $10 + 4 \div 2 = 10 + 2 = 12$
- C: $16 - 6 + 2 = 12$ (This is the same as the expression without brackets, testing if students think brackets around the division change anything).
- D: $(10 + 4) \div 2 = 14 \div 2 = 7$ (Correct).

The misconception "Carries out operations from left to right" is very strong in this age group (11-16). A student following left-to-right logic on the original expression $16-6+4 \div 2$ would do $10+4=14$, then $14 \div 2 = 7$. Because the left-to-right result matches the target answer, students are highly likely to select D, even if they don't fully grasp why the brackets are necessary. This makes the question "easier" than other BIDMAS questions because the "wrong" intuition leads to the "right" answer.

Comparing to the calibration items:
- Item 2 ($0.4 - 1/5 \times 3$) had a very low classical difficulty (0.134) because the left-to-right intuition led to the *wrong* answer. 
- In this target item, the left-to-right intuition leads to the *correct* answer D. Therefore, I expect a much higher proportion correct (classical difficulty) than Item 2.
- The procedural steps are moderate (evaluating 4 options), but many students will stop at D or use the "left-to-right" shortcut.
- IRT difficulty (b) should be lower (easier) than Item 5 (0.808) because the target answer aligns with a common error pattern.
