The item assesses the ability to rearrange a linear equation from standard form (Ax + By = C) into slope-intercept form (y = mx + c) to identify the gradient. This requires multi-step algebraic manipulation, including subtracting terms and dividing by coefficients, which often leads to sign errors or inversion mistakes. The distractors are highly plausible as they represent common partial solutions or coefficient-only identifications. Based on the provided calibration items, this task is moderately difficult for the target age group due to the abstract nature of algebraic rearrangement and the specific misconception regarding inverse operations.
