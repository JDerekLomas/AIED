The item evaluates the ability to identify correct algebraic manipulations in a multi-step linear equation. It specifically targets the inverse operation misconception, where students might add 6 to the result instead of multiplying by 2 (Tom) or divide 10 by 2 instead of multiplying (Katie). Because both distractors represent common errors, the correct answer "Neither" is cognitively demanding and requires evaluating two separate claims. Based on the calibration items, this structure typically results in a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination.
