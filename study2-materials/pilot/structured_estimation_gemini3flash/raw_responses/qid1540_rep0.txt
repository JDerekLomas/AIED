The item assesses quadratic substitution involving a negative integer, which is a common stumbling block for UK secondary students. The primary cognitive demand lies in squaring -1 and correctly managing the signs in the subsequent subtraction, specifically the interaction between the negative coefficient and the negative variable value. I have evaluated the distractors as highly plausible representations of common arithmetic errors, and the difficulty is calibrated against the provided examples involving similar sign-based misconceptions.
