The item assesses the translation of a multi-step verbal description into algebraic notation, specifically focusing on the correct use of brackets (order of operations). 

1. **Mathematical Analysis**: 
   - Step 1: $n - 5$
   - Step 2: $(n - 5) / 8$
   - Step 3: $((n - 5) / 8) + 4$
   - Step 4: $7 \times [((n - 5) / 8) + 4]$
   Jo's expression correctly nests the addition of 4 within the multiplication of 7 using brackets. Paul's expression applies the multiplication by 7 only to the division part, leaving the + 4 outside.

2. **Difficulty & Psychometrics**:
   - The misconception tested ("left to right" processing) is very common. Students often fail to see that "finally multiply by 7" applies to the *entire* result of the previous steps.
   - Paul's expression looks plausible to a student who processes the sequence linearly without nested grouping.
   - Compared to the calibration items, this is more complex than a one-step equation but less abstract than the inequality item. The "Both/Neither" format usually increases difficulty because it prevents simple elimination.
   - In UK secondary schools (Year 7-9), this is a standard "forming expressions" task. However, the nested nature makes it tricky.
   - Discrimination is likely to be high because it cleanly separates those who understand the distributive property/BIDMAS from those who follow a linear flow.

3. **Comparison with Calibration**:
   - Similar to the function machine item (Difficulty 0.295), but notationally more demanding.
   - The "Only Jo/Paul/Both/Neither" format is often harder for students than choosing a single expression.
   - I expect a classical difficulty around 0.35 - 0.40, placing it in the mid-range of the provided examples.
