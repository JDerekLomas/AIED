The item assesses a foundational rule of arithmetic—multiplying two negative integers—within the context of algebraic expansion. While the visual representation (arrows) narrows the focus to a single procedural step, the common misconception that a negative times a negative equals a negative remains a powerful distractor for students in the 11-16 age range. Based on the provided calibration examples, specifically the Tom and Katie item which shares the same misconception, this item is likely to have a moderate difficulty level and a significant discrimination factor, as it clearly separates those who have mastered sign rules from those who apply additive logic or incorrect sign conventions.
