The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of multiplication over addition and subtraction. The problem requires three operations: multiplication, subtraction, and addition. The core challenge lies in resisting the "left-to-right" impulse, which leads to a common misconception. Distractor A (36) targets the left-to-right error, while D (33) targets a specific ordering error or calculation slip. Given the simplicity of the arithmetic but the persistence of the misconception, the difficulty is expected to be moderate with high discrimination among lower-ability students.
