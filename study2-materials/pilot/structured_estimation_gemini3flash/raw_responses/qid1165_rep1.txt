The item assesses a single, specific component of binomial expansion: multiplying two negative integers. The visual aid focuses the student's attention on the -8 and -2, reducing the cognitive load compared to a full expansion. The primary challenge lies in the common misconception that the product of two negatives remains negative or involves addition/subtraction. Based on the calibration items, this specific algebraic misconception often leads to a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination, as it clearly separates students with firm sign rules from those without.
