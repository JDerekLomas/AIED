The item assesses the application of the discriminant part of the quadratic formula, specifically focusing on the squaring of a negative coefficient ($b = -3$). The core challenge lies in the common misconception that $(-3)^2 = -9$, which leads students to choose Distractor D. The question structure is somewhat abstract as it uses a symbolic representation (a triangle) rather than the full formula, which increases the cognitive load and requires students to map the formula's structure to the provided visual. Based on the calibration examples, items involving sign errors and algebraic manipulation in the UK secondary curriculum typically show moderate to high difficulty and strong discrimination.
