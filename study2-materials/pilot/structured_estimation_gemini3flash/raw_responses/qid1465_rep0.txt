The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) using subtraction, addition, and multiplication. The primary cognitive challenge lies in overriding the natural left-to-right reading impulse to prioritize the multiplication step ($4 \times 2 = 8$) before performing addition and subtraction. Distractors are specifically designed to capture students who calculate linearly ($3-5 = -2$, then $-2+4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$) or those who make common signed-number errors during the process. Given the calibration examples, items involving order of operations often show low classical difficulty because the misconception is highly prevalent among this age group.
