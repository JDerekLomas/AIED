The item requires solving a linear equation with the unknown on both sides: \(20t - 5 = 5t + 10\).
Step 1: Subtract \(5t\) from both sides: \(15t - 5 = 10\).
Step 2: Add 5 to both sides: \(15t = 15\).
Step 3: Divide by 15: \(t = 1\).

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A (\(t=0\)): Might come from a total misunderstanding of the terms or thinking \(10 - 10\) or similar, but less likely.
- Option C (\(t=-1\)): Likely results from a sign error, perhaps \(15t = -15\) or \(25t = -25\).
- Option D (\(t=1/5\)): Could come from \(15t = 3\) or similar manipulation errors, or potentially \(5/25\) if they add \(5t\) and add \(5\) but then divide the wrong way.

The "Misconception tested" provided is "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
If a student uses the same operation:
- Instead of subtracting \(5t\), they add \(5t\): \(25t - 5 = 10 \Rightarrow 25t = 15\) or \(25t = 5\).
- Instead of adding 5, they subtract 5: \(15t = 5\).
None of these lead directly to the distractors in a simple way, suggesting the distractors might catch general arithmetic/sign errors or the specific misconception in a multi-step context.

Compared to the calibration items:
- Item 1 (\(-5 = p+10\)) is a 1-step equation and had a very low classical difficulty (0.167), though its IRT difficulty was -0.702 (suggesting it's actually "easy" for the latent trait but perhaps tricky for the cohort).
- Item 5 (\(2n+3 \leq 3n-7\)) is a similar multi-step structure but with inequalities. It had a classical difficulty of 0.569 and IRT difficulty of 0.808.
- The target item is a standard "unknowns on both sides" linear equation. This is a core GCSE Foundation/KS3 skill. The numbers are "friendly" (15 and 15), which usually increases the success rate compared to equations resulting in fractions.

I expect this to be moderately difficult but easier than the inequality item because it's an equation and the numbers resolve to 1.
