The item assesses the foundational algebraic concept of inverse operations within the context of solving linear equations. It requires recognizing that to isolate a variable, one must perform the inverse of the operation currently applied to it. The visual representation using a "star" for the operation is a common pedagogical scaffold in UK secondary schools (Key Stage 3), making it highly age-appropriate but slightly more abstract than a direct calculation. The primary distractor (A) targets the common misconception of repeating the operation rather than inverting it, which is a well-documented error at this developmental stage. Based on the calibration items, this fundamental concept typically yields a relatively high facility (proportion correct) because it is a core curriculum target, though the discrimination remains high as it clearly separates those who understand algebraic balance from those who do not.
