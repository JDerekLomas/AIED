The item assesses the addition of fractions with unequal denominators, a core skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The reasoning involves identifying the need for a common denominator (20), converting the numerators (12 and 5), and summing them to reach 17/20. The primary distractor (4/9) targets the common misconception of adding numerators and denominators directly, which is highly prevalent among students in this age group. The visual representation as a "number pyramid" or "bubble" diagram adds a minor layer of interpretation but remains standard for diagnostic assessments.
