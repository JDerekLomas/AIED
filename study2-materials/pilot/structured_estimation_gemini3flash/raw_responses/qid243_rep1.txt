The item involves solving a linear inequality with variables on both sides, which is a standard topic for UK secondary students (typically KS3/KS4). The reasoning process involves comparing this item to the provided calibration example "2n + 3 ≤ 3n - 7", noting that the structure is nearly identical, requiring multi-step manipulation of terms and the handling of the inequality sign. I evaluated the specific distractors, which target common errors in inverse operations and sign handling, and estimated the parameters based on the observed performance of the similar calibration item.
