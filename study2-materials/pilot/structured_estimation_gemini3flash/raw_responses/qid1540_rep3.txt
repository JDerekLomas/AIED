The item assesses the substitution of a negative value into a quadratic expression, specifically focusing on the squaring of a negative number. Students must correctly calculate $(-1)^2 - 2(-1) + 1$, which involves managing signs across multiple terms. The primary misconception involves the common error where $(-1)^2$ is evaluated as $-1$, leading to incorrect results like 0 or -2. Based on the calibration examples, this type of algebraic manipulation with negative numbers typically results in moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
