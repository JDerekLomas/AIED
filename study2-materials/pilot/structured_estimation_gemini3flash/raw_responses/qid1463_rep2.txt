The item assesses the discriminant component of the quadratic formula, specifically identifying $b^2$ when $b$ is negative. The primary cognitive hurdle is the squaring of a negative coefficient ($(-3)^2$), where students frequently fail to recognize that the result is positive, leading to the distractor $-9$. This is a high-level secondary school topic (Key Stage 4), requiring specific procedural knowledge of the quadratic formula and firm grasp of directed numbers. The notation is slightly non-standard due to the use of symbols (triangle), which increases cognitive load but focuses the student on a specific part of the formula.
