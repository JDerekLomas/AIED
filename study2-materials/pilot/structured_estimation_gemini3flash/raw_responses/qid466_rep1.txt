The item assesses the understanding of multiplicative inverses (reciprocals) and the rules for multiplying negative numbers. The mathematical operations are relatively straightforward, but the presence of negative signs on both sides of the equation increases the likelihood of sign errors. The distractors are highly plausible as they represent common errors: forgetting to flip the fraction, failing to account for the double negative, or assuming the value must be identical to the coefficient. Based on the calibration examples, items involving negative number operations and fraction manipulation typically show moderate difficulty and high discrimination among students in the 11-16 age range.
