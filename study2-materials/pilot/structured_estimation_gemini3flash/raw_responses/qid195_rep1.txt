The item involves solving a linear equation with fractional components, requiring students to apply inverse operations in a specific sequence. I evaluated the cognitive demand by considering the steps of multiplying by the denominator and adding the constant, while also accounting for the specific distractors that target common algebraic and arithmetic errors. My reasoning concludes that while the algebraic structure is standard for the UK curriculum, the inclusion of fractions increases the likelihood of procedural slips and makes the distractors highly plausible.
