The item tests the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically identifying which operation to perform first in the expression \( 8-7 \div 6^{3} \). 

- **Concepts**: The hierarchy of operations (Indices before Division before Subtraction).
- **Complexity**: Low. It asks for the first step, not the final evaluation. This reduces the procedural load significantly compared to the second calibration example (\(0.4 - \frac{1}{5} \times 3\)).
- **Distractors**: 
    - Option C (\(8-7\)) targets the "left-to-right" misconception (AS before DM/I). 
    - Option B (\(7 \div 6\)) targets those who know division comes before subtraction but forget indices come first.
    - Option D is a "safety net" for confused students.
- **Student Population**: UK students aged 11-16. Order of operations is a foundational Key Stage 3 concept.
- **Difficulty Comparison**: The second calibration example had a classical difficulty of 0.134 and IRT difficulty of -0.245. However, that item required fraction-to-decimal conversion and a full calculation. This target item only asks for the *first step*, which is cognitively easier. 
- **Discrimination**: Order of operations items usually discriminate well between students who have mastered the hierarchy and those who rely on intuitive left-to-right processing.
- **Guessing**: With 4 choices, the floor is 0.25, but the "left-to-right" misconception is so strong that students often choose C deliberately rather than guessing randomly, which can suppress the effective guessing parameter.
