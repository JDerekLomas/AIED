The item assesses the ability to find the y-intercept of a quadratic function in factored form, specifically testing the expansion of the constant term and the handling of negative integers. The primary misconception involves the sign of the product of two negative numbers, while distractors also target the confusion between x-intercepts and y-intercepts. Based on the calibration items, this requires a moderate level of prerequisite knowledge regarding coordinate geometry and quadratic expansion.
