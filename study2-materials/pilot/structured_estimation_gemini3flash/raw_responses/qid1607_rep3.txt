The item assesses the ability to identify errors in a multi-step linear equation solution involving multiplication and subtraction. I am evaluating the complexity of algebraic manipulation for the 11-16 age range, specifically focusing on the common "inverse operation" misconception. I have compared this item to the provided calibration examples, noting that identifying a specific step's correctness is slightly more abstract than solving the equation directly. My reasoning considers the high plausibility of Option C (believing both steps are correct) due to the common error of adding instead of subtracting in Step 2.
