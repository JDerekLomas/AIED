The item assesses knowledge of multiplicative inverses and operations with negative numbers. Students must identify that a negative multiplied by a positive yields a negative, while also calculating the reciprocal of 3/4 to reach 1. The primary distractors exploit sign errors and the confusion between inverses and identities. Based on the provided calibration items, this problem is relatively straightforward in structure but targets a persistent misconception regarding negative products, suggesting a moderate difficulty level and a typical discrimination profile for algebraic manipulation.
