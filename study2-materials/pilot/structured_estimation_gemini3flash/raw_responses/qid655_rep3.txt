The item assesses the ability to solve a simple multiplicative equation involving negative numbers and fractions. The reasoning involves identifying that the missing value requires dividing -8 by -6, which necessitates knowledge of sign rules (negative divided by negative is positive) and the relationship between multiplication and division. The distractors effectively target common errors regarding sign placement and the inversion of the numerator and denominator.
