The item tests the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the strategic use of brackets. 
- The target value is 7.
- Option A: $16 - (10 \div 2) = 16 - 5 = 11$.
- Option B: $(10) + 4 \div 2 = 10 + 2 = 12$.
- Option C: $16 - 6 + 2 = 12$ (This is the same as the original expression without brackets).
- Option D: $(16 - 6 + 4) \div 2 = (10 + 4) \div 2 = 14 \div 2 = 7$. Correct.

The primary misconception is "left-to-right" processing. If a student processes D from left to right inside the brackets, they get 7. Interestingly, the expression $16-6+4 \div 2$ without brackets equals $16-6+2 = 12$. 

Psychometric considerations:
- This is a "reverse" order of operations question (finding where the brackets go), which is slightly more cognitively demanding than simple evaluation.
- The misconception of left-to-right processing is very strong in the UK 11-14 age group.
- Compared to the calibration items, this is moderately difficult. It is more complex than a basic linear equation (Item 1) but less abstract than the inequality (Item 5).
- Option C is a "distractor" because it doesn't change the value of the expression, which might confuse students who don't understand that brackets around a high-priority operation are redundant.
- Based on the calibration items, "proportion correct" for BIDMAS items with strong misconceptions usually falls between 0.3 and 0.5.
