The item assesses the fundamental understanding of algebraic notation and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students must recognize that juxtaposition ($ab$) implies multiplication and takes precedence over addition. The distractors are highly plausible for students who read expressions strictly from left to right or struggle with the hierarchy of operations. Given the simplicity of the expression but the commonality of the misconception among younger secondary students, the item is likely to have moderate difficulty and strong discrimination.
