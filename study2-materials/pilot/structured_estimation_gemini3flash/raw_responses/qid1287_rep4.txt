The item assesses the ability to translate a concrete visual representation (cups and counters) into algebraic notation and follow the steps of solving a linear equation. The first step involves recognizing that subtracting terms from both sides is the correct operation, while distractors B, C, and D capitalize on the common misconception of adding terms (e.g., $x + 2x = 3x$ and $4 + 2 = 6$) instead of using the inverse operation. The visual nature of the problem reduces the abstraction level compared to pure symbolic manipulation but increases the cognitive load due to the need to interpret the diagram correctly. Given the complexity of the visual-to-algebraic translation, the item is likely to have a moderate difficulty level, similar to other equation-solving tasks in the calibration set.
