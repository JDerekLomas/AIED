The item assesses the ability to translate a multi-step verbal word problem into a formal algebraic equation, specifically focusing on the correct use of grouping symbols or fraction notation to represent the order of operations. The item's difficulty is driven by common misconceptions regarding the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), where students often fail to account for the "result" of the first operation being the input for the second, leading them toward distractor B. Based on the calibration items, this type of algebraic translation typically shows moderate discrimination and a difficulty level that sits slightly below the mean for the target age group, as it is a fundamental skill in the Key Stage 3 curriculum.
