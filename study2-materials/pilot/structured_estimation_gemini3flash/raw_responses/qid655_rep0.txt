<chain_of_thought>
The item assesses the ability to solve a single-step linear equation involving negative integers and fractions. It specifically targets the sign rules for multiplication and division (negative divided by negative) and the algebraic procedure of isolating a variable. The distractors are highly plausible as they cover common errors: reciprocal confusion (A and B) and sign errors (B and C). Given the cognitive demands of managing both negative signs and fractional results, this item is expected to have a moderate to high difficulty level for the target age group.
