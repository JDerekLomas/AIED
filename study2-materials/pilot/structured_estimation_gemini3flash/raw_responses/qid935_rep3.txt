The item assesses the ability to substitute a known value into a linear equation and solve for the remaining variable, specifically testing the handling of negative numbers and inverse operations. The reasoning considers the cognitive load of substitution combined with the common error of using addition instead of subtraction (or vice versa) when isolating the variable. Based on the provided calibration items, this task is moderately difficult for the target age group due to the potential for sign errors and the abstract nature of algebraic manipulation.
