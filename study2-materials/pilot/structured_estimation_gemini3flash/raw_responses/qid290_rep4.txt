The item evaluates the concept of counter-examples involving quadratic expressions and negative results. Reasoning follows these steps:
1. Identify the mathematical objective: Finding a value of $n$ such that $2n^2 - 1 \leq 0$.
2. Evaluate each option: Option A results in $2(9/16)-1 = 1.125-1 > 0$. Option B results in $2(0.25)-1 = 0.5-1 = -0.5$, which is negative. Options C and D involve negative bases which, when squared, result in positive values greater than or equal to 1, thus yielding positive results.
3. Assess misconceptions: Students often struggle with squaring fractions/decimals (thinking the result gets larger) or believe negative inputs automatically lead to negative outputs (the specific misconception noted).
4. Psychometric estimation: The item requires multiple steps (substitution, squaring, multiplication, subtraction) and an understanding of "counter-example." The abstraction level is moderate for the 11-16 age range.
