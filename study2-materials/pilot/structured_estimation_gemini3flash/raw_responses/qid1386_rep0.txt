The item assesses the addition of algebraic fractions with common denominators. The reasoning involves evaluating the simplicity of the expression against common misconceptions, specifically the tendency for students to add denominators (Option C) or multiply terms (Option D). Given the common denominator, the procedural demand is low, but the presence of variables increases the abstraction level and potential for confusion.
