The item assesses the ability to identify a counter-example for a quadratic expression involving fractions, decimals, and negative numbers. To solve it, students must evaluate each expression to see which yields a non-positive result. Option B results in $2(0.25) - 1 = -0.5$, which is negative. The misconception involves the sign of squared numbers, particularly negative values or the effect of squaring small decimals/fractions. The complexity is moderate due to the need to handle indices, order of operations, and different number formats simultaneously.
