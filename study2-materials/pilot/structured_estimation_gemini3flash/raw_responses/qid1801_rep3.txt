The item assesses the ability to solve a double inequality, which involves applying inverse operations to two inequalities simultaneously or splitting them. The procedural steps include subtracting 1 from all parts and then dividing by 2. Distractors target common errors such as applying the wrong operation (addition instead of subtraction), only operating on one side, or making arithmetic slips. Given the comparative difficulty of double inequalities versus single linear equations in the UK curriculum, this item is expected to have a higher difficulty parameter and moderate discrimination.
