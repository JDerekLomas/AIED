The item evaluates the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically within the context of fraction arithmetic. Students must correctly prioritize multiplication over subtraction and then perform fraction subtraction with unlike denominators. The distractors are strategically designed to capture common errors: Option C is correct ($3/4 - 1/20 = 15/20 - 1/20 = 14/20 = 7/10$); Option B results from the left-to-right misconception ($2/4 \times 1/5 = 1/2 \times 1/5 = 1/10$); Option A reflects poor fraction subtraction and multiplication mechanics; and Option D represents a partial calculation or scaling error. Based on the calibration examples involving order of operations and fraction manipulation, this item is likely to have a low proportion correct due to the compounding of two distinct procedural hurdles (priority and denominator conversion), resulting in a negative IRT difficulty similar to the second calibration example.
