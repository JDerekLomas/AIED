The item assesses the understanding of calculating the mean, specifically focusing on the treatment of zero in a dataset and the correct use of mathematical notation (order of operations). Option A is correct as it includes all five values (even though 0 is omitted from the numerator's sum, the divisor 5 accounts for it). Option B tests order of operations (BIDMAS/PEMDAS) errors. Option C tests the misconception that zero does not count as a data point. The item is conceptually straightforward for the 11-16 age range but contains strong distractors related to common arithmetic misconceptions.
