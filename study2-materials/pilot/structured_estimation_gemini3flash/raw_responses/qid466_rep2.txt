The item assesses the understanding of multiplicative inverses (reciprocals) and the rules of signs for multiplication. The presence of the negative sign in the product and the multiplicand requires students to recognize that a positive multiplier is necessary. Distractors B, C, and D effectively target common errors regarding sign rules and reciprocal properties. Given the calibration examples, items involving fractions and negative signs often yield lower classical difficulty scores than expected, as students frequently struggle with the interplay of these two concepts.
