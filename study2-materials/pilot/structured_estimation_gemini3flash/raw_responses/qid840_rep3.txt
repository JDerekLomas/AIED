The item assesses the understanding of inverse operations in linear equations, specifically focusing on division and multiplication. Reasoning involves evaluating two distinct algebraic manipulations: Tom incorrectly applies division to both sides (dividing 40 by 5 instead of multiplying), while Katie correctly divides both sides by 8. The format requires evaluating two statements, which increases cognitive load compared to a simple calculation. Based on the provided calibration items, this type of conceptual verification typically results in a moderate difficulty level and a high discrimination factor, as it distinguishes between students who follow rote procedures and those who understand the underlying logic of equality.
