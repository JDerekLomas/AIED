The item asks students to solve the linear equation $3 - y = 5$. This is a classic "one-step" or "two-step" equation involving a negative variable term, which is a notorious stumbling block for UK secondary students (Key Stage 3 and 4).

1.  **Mathematical Analysis**:
    *   The correct solution is $y = -2$ (since $3 - (-2) = 5$).
    *   Distractor A ($y = 2$): Results from $3 + y = 5$ or simply seeing the difference between 3 and 5 as 2 without considering the sign.
    *   Distractor C ($y = 8$): Results from "using the same operation" (adding 3 and 5) or incorrectly moving the 3 over as an addition ($y = 5 + 3$).
    *   Distractor D ($y = -8$): Results from $y = -(3 + 5)$.

2.  **Psychometric Calibration**:
    *   Comparing to the first calibration example ($-5 = p + 10$), which had a classical difficulty of 0.167 (very hard) and IRT $b$ of -0.702. Note: In this dataset, a lower $b$ often corresponds to a lower proportion correct, suggesting the scale might be inverted or specific to a low-ability cohort. However, looking at the sequence, as classical difficulty increases (0.16 -> 0.56), the IRT $b$ increases (-0.7 -> 0.8). This implies $b$ is positively correlated with the *ability* required, but the classical difficulty is quite low across the board.
    *   The target item $3 - y = 5$ is conceptually similar to $-5 = p + 10$ but slightly more difficult due to the subtraction of the variable ($y$ vs $+p$). 
    *   The misconception "uses same operation" is specifically targeted by Distractor C ($3+5=8$).
    *   The discrimination is likely to be high because this specific structure (a - x = b) effectively separates students who understand inverse operations from those who use rote "change the side, change the sign" incorrectly.

3.  **Parameter Estimation**:
    *   Classical Difficulty: Likely low, similar to the first two examples. Many students will pick 2 or 8. I estimate ~0.22.
    *   IRT Difficulty ($b$): Following the calibration trend, it should be between -0.6 and -0.3.
    *   IRT Discrimination ($a$): These algebraic items show high discrimination (1.2 - 1.5). I'll estimate 1.4.
    *   Guessing ($c$): Simple 1-step equations usually have low guessing parameters in this age group as students are confident in their (often wrong) methods.
