The item assesses the understanding of the mean calculation, specifically focusing on the inclusion of zero in the count and the correct use of order of operations (BIDMAS) in notation. The distractors target common errors: Option B addresses the misconception of ignoring operator precedence in linear expressions, while Option C targets the exclusion of zero from the denominator. The item is conceptually straightforward for the target age group but requires careful attention to notation.
