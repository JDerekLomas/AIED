The item evaluates a student's ability to substitute a negative integer into a quadratic expression, specifically focusing on the common error of squaring a negative number. I have assessed the complexity of the substitution process, the strength of the negative number misconception, and the clarity of the tabular presentation to estimate the difficulty and discrimination parameters based on the provided calibration data.
