<chain_of_thought>
The item assesses the understanding of the commutative property and the order of operations by presenting two statements involving addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Reasoning involves evaluating Tom's statement (reordering addition and subtraction) and Katie's statement (reordering addition and multiplication), both of which are mathematically equivalent. The cognitive demand is moderate as it requires verifying identities rather than performing a single calculation, and the misconception of strict left-to-right processing is specifically targeted by the structure of the expressions.
