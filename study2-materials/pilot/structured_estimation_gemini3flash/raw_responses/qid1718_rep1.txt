The item assesses the expansion of a squared binomial, a core algebraic skill for students aged 13-16. The reasoning involves recognizing the expression as $(x-3)(x-3)$ and applying the distributive law (FOIL) while correctly handling the signs of the terms. I evaluated the distractors: B and C represent the common "freshman's dream" error where students square individual terms, while A targets the specific misconception regarding the product of two negative numbers. Based on the calibration items, this type of algebraic manipulation typically shows moderate discrimination and a difficulty level where approximately 40-50% of students succeed, as the misconception of sign errors is highly prevalent in this age group.
