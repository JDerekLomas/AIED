The item assesses basic fraction addition with common denominators followed by simplifying the result. The reasoning involves identifying that while the addition itself is a fundamental lower-secondary skill, the requirement to simplify the answer to "simplest form" adds a necessary second step that often leads to errors or the selection of plausible distractors like 8/10 or 8/20. The misconception of adding both numerators and denominators is highly prevalent in this age group, which suggests a moderate level of difficulty despite the simplicity of the numbers.
