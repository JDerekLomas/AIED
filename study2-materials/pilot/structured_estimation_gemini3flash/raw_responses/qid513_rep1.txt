The target item asks students to evaluate two steps in solving a linear equation: $15 = 2p - 4$.
Step 1: $11 = 2p$ (The student subtracted 4 instead of adding 4; inverse operation error).
Step 2: $22 = p$ (The student multiplied by 2 instead of dividing by 2; inverse operation error).

Psychometric Analysis:
- The item tests the "inverse operation" misconception twice. 
- Distractor A (Only step 1) is attractive if a student thinks $15-4=11$ is the correct first move.
- Distractor B (Only step 2) is attractive if a student thinks multiplying the result of an incorrect step 1 by 2 is a "correct" algebraic move in isolation, though unlikely.
- Distractor C (Both correct) is very attractive to students who consistently use the same operation rather than the inverse.
- Correct Answer D (Both incorrect) requires identifying two distinct errors.

Comparison with Calibration Items:
- Item 1 ($-5 = p + 10$) had a classical difficulty of 0.167 (very hard). 
- Item 3 (Function machine for $x^2 + 5 = 14$) had a difficulty of 0.295.
- This target item is slightly more complex than Item 1 because it requires checking two steps, but the "Both incorrect" option is often a difficult choice for students who lack confidence.
- The "inverse operation" misconception is strong. Many students will see $15-4=11$ and immediately think Step 1 is correct.
- Given the calibration data where simple inverse operation questions have very low success rates (0.167 to 0.295), this item is likely to have a low proportion correct. The IRT difficulty (b) will likely be near or slightly below 0, similar to Item 2 and 3.

Discrimination is likely to be high as this is a classic diagnostic question. Guessing is likely low (0) because students with the misconception are drawn strongly to specific distractors rather than guessing randomly.
