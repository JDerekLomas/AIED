The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically regarding the priority of division over subtraction and the non-commutative property of subtraction. The use of decimals instead of integers adds a layer of arithmetic complexity, though the core of the question is identifying the correct symbolic representation rather than calculating a final value. Comparison with the calibration examples suggests a moderate difficulty level, as students often default to left-to-right processing (Katie's suggestion) or struggle with the equivalence of parenthetical notation.
