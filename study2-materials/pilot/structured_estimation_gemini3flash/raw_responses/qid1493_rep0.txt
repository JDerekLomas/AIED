The target item tests the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEMDAS) specifically focusing on indices (powers) versus division and subtraction. 

The question asks "Which calculation should you do first?" rather than asking for the final numerical result. This meta-cognitive approach often yields higher performance than calculation-based questions because it removes arithmetic error as a factor, but it still directly targets the hierarchy of operations.

- **Option A (Correct):** $6^3$ is the index/power. In BIDMAS, Indices come before Division and Subtraction.
- **Option B:** $7 \div 6$ suggests a left-to-right approach for the operations following the number 8, or a belief that division precedes indices.
- **Option C:** $8-7$ is the classic "left-to-right" misconception (Subtraction before Division/Indices), which is very common in lower secondary.
- **Option D:** A common distractor for students who lack confidence in mathematical rules.

Comparing this to the calibration items:
- The calibration item $0.4 - 1/5 \times 3$ had a classical difficulty of 0.134. That item required actual calculation and involved fractions/decimals, making it much harder.
- The target item is more conceptual and uses a standard "what comes first" format.
- UK students (Year 7-9) are heavily drilled in BIDMAS. Identifying the "first" step is a foundational skill. However, the "left-to-right" misconception (Option C) remains a powerful attractor.

The discrimination is likely to be high because this is a "pure" test of a specific rule. The guessing parameter will likely be low because the distractors (especially C) are based on a specific, strong misconception rather than random choice.
