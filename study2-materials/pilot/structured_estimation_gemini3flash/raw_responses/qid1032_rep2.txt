The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of multiplication over addition. The primary distractor (A) targets the left-to-right processing error, which is a highly common and persistent misconception in this age group. Compared to the calibration examples, this is a more fundamental arithmetic task with lower procedural complexity but a very strong, singular cognitive trap.
