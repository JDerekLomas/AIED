The item involves algebraic fraction addition, requiring students to find a common denominator. The presence of a variable in the denominator increases abstraction, while the specific misconception (adding numerators and denominators) is highly common in this age group. Based on the calibration items, algebraic manipulation typically results in moderate discrimination and a higher difficulty parameter than basic arithmetic.
