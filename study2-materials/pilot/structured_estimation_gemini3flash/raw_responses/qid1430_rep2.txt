The item assesses the foundational skill of adding fractions with common denominators. The reasoning process involves identifying that the operation requires only the addition of numerators while keeping the denominator constant. The primary distractor (D) targets the common misconception of adding both numerators and denominators, which is highly prevalent in early secondary education. Given the simplicity of the numbers and the direct nature of the question, the cognitive load is low, but the strength of the misconception typically leads to a significant number of errors even among older students. The difficulty is expected to be lower (higher proportion correct) than the calibration examples involving algebra or multi-step arithmetic.
