The item assesses order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically comparing the left-to-right rule for addition/subtraction against the priority of multiplication over addition. I have evaluated the complexity of the arithmetic operations, the commonality of the misconception where students prioritize addition over subtraction regardless of position, and the clarity of the presentation. My reasoning follows the provided calibration data by adjusting difficulty expectations based on the presence of multiple distractors that target specific hierarchy-of-operation errors.
