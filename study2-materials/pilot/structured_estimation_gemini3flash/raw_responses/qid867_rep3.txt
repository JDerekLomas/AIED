The item assesses binomial expansion, specifically the square of a linear expression with a negative constant. This is a foundational secondary school topic that involves expanding $(x-4)(x-4)$ and combining like terms. Distractor B targets the common "freshman's dream" error, while distractors C and D target sign errors in the constant term or middle term. Given the prevalence of these specific misconceptions in this age group, the item is expected to show moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
