The item assesses the ability to solve a single-step linear equation involving fractions. Reasoning involves recognizing the inverse operation of multiplication (division) and applying it to a unit fraction, which necessitates knowledge of fraction multiplication or division rules. The distractors are highly plausible, targeting common errors such as multiplying by the coefficient (A), treating the fraction as the multiplier for the denominator (C), or incorrectly applying the coefficient to the denominator via addition/miscalculation (D). Comparing this to the calibration items, it presents a higher cognitive hurdle than simple integer equations but remains a fundamental algebraic task for the target age group.
