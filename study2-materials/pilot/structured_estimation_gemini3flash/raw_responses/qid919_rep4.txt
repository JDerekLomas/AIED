The item assesses the application of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) within a quadratic function context. Students must evaluate $y = 3x^2$ for $x = 0.3$, requiring them to square the decimal before multiplying by the coefficient. The primary distractor (A) targets the misconception of multiplying $3 \times 0.3$ first and then squaring, while others address decimal place value errors. Given the calibration examples, this item represents a moderate level of difficulty for the 11-16 age range, as decimal squaring often introduces calculation errors even when the order of operations is understood.
