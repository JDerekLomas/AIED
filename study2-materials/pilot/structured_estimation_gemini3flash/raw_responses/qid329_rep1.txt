The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically regarding subtraction and division, while also testing the understanding of commutativity. I evaluated the cognitive load required to identify that Tom correctly identifies the priority of division over subtraction, while Katie incorrectly suggests subtraction is commutative or that the order can be reversed. Based on the calibration examples involving order of operations and decimal arithmetic, the item is likely to have a moderate level of difficulty as students often default to left-to-right processing.
