The item involves rearranging a formula with three variables, requiring two distinct algebraic operations: multiplying by a denominator and taking a square root. The abstraction level is moderate as it uses purely symbolic notation common in the UK Key Stage 4 curriculum. Distractors target common errors such as squaring instead of rooting or failing to multiply across the equals sign correctly. Based on the calibration items, this problem is slightly more difficult than basic linear equations but more straightforward than inequality manipulation.
