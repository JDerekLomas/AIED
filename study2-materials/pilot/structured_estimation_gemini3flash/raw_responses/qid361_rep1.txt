The item tests the ability to translate a multi-step verbal description of operations into a correct algebraic expression, specifically focusing on the use of brackets to preserve the order of operations.

Jo's expression is correct: $7\left(\frac{(n-5)}{8}+4\right)$. It correctly nests the subtraction, division, and addition within the final multiplication.
Paul's expression is incorrect: $7((n-5) \div 8)+4$. It fails to include the "+4" within the scope of the multiplication by 7, which is the final step in the verbal instruction.

Psychometric Analysis:
- Concept Complexity: Moderate. Requires understanding of BIDMAS/order of operations and algebraic notation.
- Procedural Steps: There are four operations to track (subtract, divide, add, multiply).
- Misconception: Paul's error is a classic "left-to-right" or "priority" error where the student fails to realize the final operation must apply to the entire preceding result. This is a very common misconception in UK secondary schools (Key Stage 3 and 4).
- Distractor Plausibility: "Only Paul" or "Both" are very attractive to students who struggle with the distributive property or the hierarchy of brackets.
- Calibration comparison: This item is more complex than the simple equation solve (Example 1) and more abstract than the function machine (Example 3). It shares similarities with Example 2 (0.4 - 1/5 * 3) regarding order of operations.
- Difficulty: The nested nature of the brackets makes it harder than average. Based on the calibration examples where 0.4-0.5 is common for algebraic manipulation, this should sit in the 0.35-0.45 range for classical difficulty.
- Discrimination: Items involving "Who is correct?" with algebraic expressions usually discriminate well between students who understand structural notation and those who apply operations linearly.
