The item assesses quadratic factorisation, specifically the ability to identify factors that sum to -1 and multiply to -6. I have evaluated the complexity of managing negative signs in algebraic expressions and the commonality of sign errors in this age group. Based on the calibration items, this task is moderately difficult for the 11-16 cohort, as many students struggle with the distinction between different sign combinations in binomial expansion.
