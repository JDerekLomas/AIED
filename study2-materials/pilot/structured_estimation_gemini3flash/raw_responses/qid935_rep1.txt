The item assesses the ability to substitute a known value into a linear equation and solve for the remaining variable. While framed within the context of simultaneous equations, the actual task is a single-step substitution followed by a two-step linear equation resolution ($2j - 8 = -10$). The primary cognitive hurdle is the manipulation of negative numbers and the application of inverse operations (adding 8 to -10). The distractors are strategically chosen to capture common errors: failing to use inverse operations (resulting in $j=1$ or $j=-9$) or miscalculating the sum of signed integers. Given the calibration items, this task is moderately difficult for the target age group due to the prevalence of sign errors and the tendency to subtract rather than add when moving terms across the equality.
