The item assesses basic order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically identifying the priority of brackets over multiplication and addition. Based on the calibration examples, items involving order of operations often have high discrimination because they target a specific, common misconception (left-to-right processing). While the calculation itself is simple, students frequently default to sequential processing, making the distractors highly plausible for lower-ability students.
