The item assesses the ability to find the y-intercept of a quadratic function in factored form, specifically testing the expansion of the constant term and the multiplication of directed numbers. I evaluated the complexity of identifying that the y-intercept occurs when x=0, the procedural requirement of calculating (-8) * (-6), and the likelihood of students selecting distractors based on common errors like adding the constants or failing the sign rule. Based on the provided calibration data for similar algebraic and sign-based misconceptions, I estimated the difficulty and discrimination parameters.
