The item assesses the ability to substitute a value into a linear equation with two variables and solve for the remaining variable. The substitution $x=0$ simplifies the equation to $2y=10$, which is a foundational algebraic skill. The distractors target common errors: $20$ (misapplying operations), $2.5$ (incorrectly dividing $10$ by $4$), and $3$ (potential arithmetic error or misinterpreting the table structure). Given the simplicity of the substitution $x=0$, the item is likely to have a relatively high success rate among the target age group, though the presence of the table format adds a slight layer of visual interpretation.
