The item assesses addition of mixed numbers with unequal denominators, a core skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The process involves identifying a common denominator (20), converting the fractional parts, and handling the whole numbers separately or via improper fractions. The distractors are highly diagnostic: Option D addresses the common misconception of adding numerators and denominators directly, while Option A provides the correct value but in an improper fraction format, testing the student's ability to follow the specific instruction to provide a mixed number. The cognitive load is moderate due to the multi-step nature of the calculation.
