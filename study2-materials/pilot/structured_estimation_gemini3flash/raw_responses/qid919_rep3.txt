The item assesses the ability to substitute a decimal value into a quadratic expression, requiring an understanding of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) where squaring must occur before multiplication. The distractors are strategically chosen: 0.27 (correct), 0.81 (squaring the product of 3 and 0.3), 1.8 (doubling the product), and 2.7 (incorrect decimal placement or multiplication). The misconception of left-to-right processing is common in early secondary algebra. Comparison with calibration items suggests a moderate difficulty level due to the decimal arithmetic involved, which often increases error rates compared to integer-based problems.
