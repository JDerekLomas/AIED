<chain_of_thought>
The item assesses basic algebraic expansion involving negative coefficients and directed numbers. The core difficulty lies in the multiplication of two negative integers (-3 * -2), which is a common source of error for students in this age range. While the procedural steps are minimal, the misconception regarding negative signs is highly prevalent, leading to strong distractor plausibility. Based on the calibration examples, this item is likely to have a moderate discrimination and a difficulty level that sits in the middle of the spectrum for the 11-16 age group.
