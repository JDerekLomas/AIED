The item involves a standard two-step linear equation requiring students to add 3 to both sides and then divide by 12. The primary misconception involves incorrect inverse operations or reversing the division (12/3 instead of 3/12), leading to common distractors. Based on the calibration examples, this item has a low procedural load but targets a specific, persistent algebraic misconception, suggesting a moderate IRT difficulty and high discrimination.
