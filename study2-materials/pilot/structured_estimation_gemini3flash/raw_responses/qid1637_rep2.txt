The item assesses the ability to solve a two-sided linear inequality, requiring the application of inverse operations (subtraction and division) to all three parts of the expression. I have evaluated the complexity of the multi-step procedure against the provided calibration items, noting that while the steps are standard, the presence of negative numbers and the three-part structure increases cognitive load and the likelihood of procedural errors or the identified misconception.
