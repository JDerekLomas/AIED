The item assesses the ability to solve a basic linear equation involving negative integers and fractions. To arrive at the correct answer (D), a student must recognize that dividing -8 by -6 results in a positive fraction and correctly identify the relationship between the terms. The primary cognitive hurdles involve handling the sign (negative divided by negative) and the reciprocal error (choosing 6/8 instead of 8/6). Based on the calibration items, students frequently struggle with inverse operations and sign rules, making the distractors highly plausible.
