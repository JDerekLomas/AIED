The item asks for the sum of two fractions with different denominators: \( \frac{2}{9} + \frac{1}{3} \).
- **Correct Answer (A):** Requires finding a common denominator (9), converting \( \frac{1}{3} \) to \( \frac{3}{9} \), and adding numerators: \( \frac{2+3}{9} = \frac{5}{9} \).
- **Distractor (B) \(\frac{3}{12}\):** This represents the classic "add across" misconception (\(2+1\) and \(9+3\)). This is one of the most common errors in secondary mathematics.
- **Distractor (C) \(\frac{3}{9}\):** Likely results from adding numerators but keeping the larger denominator, or a failed conversion of \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- **Distractor (D) \(\frac{1}{6}\):** Harder to justify, perhaps an incorrect attempt at simplifying or a random guess.

**Psychometric Analysis:**
- **Classical Difficulty:** Adding fractions with different denominators is a fundamental skill but notoriously difficult for lower-attaining students. However, since 9 is a multiple of 3, this is the "easiest" version of different-denominator addition. Comparing to the calibration examples, it is likely easier than solving linear equations with negative results (Item 1) but harder than simple substitution.
- **IRT Difficulty (b):** Given the high frequency of the "add across" error, many students fail this. Based on the calibration items where Proportion Correct (0.16-0.56) maps to b-values (-0.7 to 0.8), this item should sit in the middle-low range.
- **Discrimination (a):** This is a "classic" diagnostic question. It usually discriminates well between those who understand the algorithm and those relying on intuitive (but wrong) additive strategies.
- **Guessing (c):** Standard 4-choice MCQ. In fraction arithmetic, students often "calculate" an incorrect answer rather than guessing randomly, but a small floor exists.
