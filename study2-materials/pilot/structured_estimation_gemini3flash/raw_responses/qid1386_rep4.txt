The item assesses the addition of algebraic fractions with common denominators. The reasoning involves evaluating the simplicity of the concept (fractions with like denominators) against the abstraction introduced by the variable $x$. While the arithmetic is basic ($2+3=5$), the presence of the variable often triggers common algebraic misconceptions, such as adding the denominators (Option C) or multiplying instead of adding (Option D). Based on the calibration examples, items involving fractions and variables tend to have higher discrimination but lower guessing parameters if the distractors align closely with specific, persistent misconceptions.
