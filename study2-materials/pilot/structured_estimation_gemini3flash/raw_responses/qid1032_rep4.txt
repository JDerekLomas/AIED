The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), a fundamental concept for UK secondary students. The reasoning involves identifying that multiplication must be performed before addition, leading to the correct answer (17). The primary distractor (27) targets the common misconception of left-to-right evaluation, which is highly prevalent in this age group. Compared to the calibration examples, this item is computationally simpler and more direct, suggesting a higher facility rate but a strong pull toward the specific misconception.
