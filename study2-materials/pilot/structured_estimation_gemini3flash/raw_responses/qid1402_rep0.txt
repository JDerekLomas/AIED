The item assesses the fundamental understanding of algebraic notation and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The expression $3 + ab$ requires the student to recognize that multiplication ($ab$) takes precedence over addition. The distractors are highly effective because they map directly to common misconceptions: Option B treats $ab$ as $a+b$, while Options C and D reflect a linear, left-to-right reading of the expression, ignoring the order of operations. Given the simplicity of the notation but the prevalence of the "left-to-right" misconception among younger secondary students, the item is likely to have moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
