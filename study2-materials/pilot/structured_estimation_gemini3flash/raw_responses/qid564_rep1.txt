The item assesses the expansion of a single bracket involving a negative multiplier and a negative constant term. I evaluated the cognitive demand by considering the two-step distributive process and the specific sign rules required. The misconception identified (multiplying two negatives to get a negative) is a high-frequency error in the 11-16 age range, making the distractors highly plausible. Based on the calibration items, particularly the factorising and equation solving examples, this task is more difficult than basic linear equations but less complex than multi-step inequalities.
