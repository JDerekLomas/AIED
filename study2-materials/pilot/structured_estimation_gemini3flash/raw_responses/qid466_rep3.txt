<chain_of_thought>
The item assesses knowledge of multiplicative inverses and the rules for multiplying negative numbers. The solver must identify that a negative product requires a positive multiplier when the first factor is negative, and that the product of 1 requires the reciprocal. The distractors are highly plausible as they cover sign errors and the use of the original fraction. Based on the calibration examples involving negative numbers and algebraic manipulation, this item is likely to have a moderate difficulty level with a high discrimination factor due to the common confusion between reciprocals and signs.
