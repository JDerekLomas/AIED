The item assesses the application of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with directed number arithmetic. Students must prioritize the multiplication of a negative number by a positive integer before performing addition with a negative integer. Based on the calibration examples, items involving order of operations misconceptions often exhibit low classical difficulty and moderate discrimination. The distractors are highly plausible, targeting left-to-right calculation errors and sign errors in addition/multiplication.
