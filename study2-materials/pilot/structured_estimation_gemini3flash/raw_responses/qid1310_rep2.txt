The item assesses the fundamental understanding of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically identifying the innermost parentheses as the starting point. My reasoning involves evaluating the complexity of the nested structure against the relative simplicity of the question's demand (identifying the first step rather than calculating the final result). Distractors are designed to appeal to left-to-right processing or misinterpretation of bracket priority, which are common errors in the 11-16 age range.
