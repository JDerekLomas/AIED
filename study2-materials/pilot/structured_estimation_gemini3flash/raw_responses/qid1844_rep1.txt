The item assesses the ability to find the y-intercept of a quadratic function in factored form, specifically testing the expansion of constants and integer arithmetic. Students must recognize that the y-intercept occurs when x=0, leading to the calculation (-8) * (-6). The primary misconception involves sign errors in multiplication, while distractors also target common errors like adding the roots or confusing the y-intercept with the x-intercepts. Based on the calibration examples, this item sits at a moderate difficulty level for the UK secondary curriculum, as it combines coordinate geometry with algebraic manipulation.
