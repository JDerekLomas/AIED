The item assesses the expansion of a single linear bracket involving negative coefficients and constants. The primary cognitive challenge lies in the application of the distributive law combined with integer arithmetic, specifically the rule that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive. This is a foundational algebra skill for UK secondary students. Given the calibration examples, this item is slightly more straightforward than solving multi-step inequalities but more complex than basic additive inverse equations, leading to a prediction of moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
