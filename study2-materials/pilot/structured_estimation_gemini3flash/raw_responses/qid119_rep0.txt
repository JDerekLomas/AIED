The item tests the multiplication and division of negative integers, specifically the rule that a negative times a negative equals a positive. 

1. **Mathematical Analysis**: 
   - Tom's calculation: \(-3 \times (-8) = -24\). This is incorrect; the product should be \(+24\).
   - Katie's calculation: \(\frac{-24}{-3} = -8\). This is incorrect; the quotient should be \(+8\).
   - Therefore, neither is correct (Option D).

2. **Misconception Profile**: The misconception "multiplying two negatives gives a negative" is extremely robust in the 11-14 age range. Students often overgeneralize the rule for adding negatives (negative + negative = negative) to multiplication.

3. **Psychometric Comparison**:
   - Looking at the calibration items, the "Tom and Katie" format (Item 4) had a classical difficulty of 0.473 and an IRT difficulty of 0.404. 
   - However, this target item involves a diagram (visual representation of a number line/vector) which adds cognitive load and potential for misinterpretation.
   - The diagram shows a vector of \(-24\) and a smaller vector that is a third of its length (\(-8\)). Students might see the visual "negative" direction and the values 3, 8, and 24 and feel both statements "look" correct because they result in -24 or -8, which are present in the diagram.
   - Because both Tom and Katie use the same incorrect sign logic, students who hold the misconception will likely choose "Both" (C). This makes the correct answer (D) quite difficult to reach.

4. **Difficulty Estimation**: The misconception is strong, and the "Neither" option is historically one of the hardest for students to select as it requires high confidence in rejecting both plausible-looking statements. I expect the proportion correct to be lower than the factorising example.
