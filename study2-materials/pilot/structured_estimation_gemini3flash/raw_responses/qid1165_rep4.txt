The item assesses a single fundamental rule of arithmetic—multiplying two negative integers—within the context of algebraic expansion. While the visual prompt uses algebraic notation (brackets), the task is isolated to a single multiplication step, reducing cognitive load and procedural complexity. The distractors are highly plausible as they represent common additive errors or sign errors frequently seen in this age group.
