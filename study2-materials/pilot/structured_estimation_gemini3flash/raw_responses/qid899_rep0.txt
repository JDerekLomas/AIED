The item assesses knowledge of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) in a very direct, conceptual manner. Unlike the calibration example involving fractions and decimals, this question only uses integers and asks for the first step rather than the final evaluation, which significantly reduces the procedural and cognitive load. The misconception of "left-to-right" processing is extremely common (Distractor B), and the "addition before subtraction" misconception (Distractor A) is also highly plausible for students who follow the acronym too rigidly. Given its foundational nature in the UK secondary curriculum, the item is likely to have a higher proportion of correct answers and a lower IRT difficulty than the more complex arithmetic examples provided.
