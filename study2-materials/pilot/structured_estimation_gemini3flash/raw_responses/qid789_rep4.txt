The item assesses basic fraction addition with common denominators, followed by the requirement to simplify the result. The core misconception (adding denominators) is highly prevalent among lower-attaining students in the 11-16 age range, making distractor A very attractive. While the initial operation is simple, the two-step process (add then simplify) increases the difficulty compared to a single-step fraction problem, as students who reach 8/10 (distractor B) may fail to perform the final reduction to 4/5. Based on the calibration items, this fundamental arithmetic task usually shows high discrimination because it clearly separates students with basic procedural fluency from those with ingrained additive misconceptions.
