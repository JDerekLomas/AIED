The item assesses the ability to substitute a value into a linear equation and solve for the remaining variable. The cognitive demand is moderate, requiring students to handle both substitution and the manipulation of a two-step equation. The visual presentation via a table is standard for the UK curriculum, though the inclusion of a specific misconception regarding inverse operations (e.g., adding instead of subtracting or multiplying instead of dividing) suggests that distractors will be highly attractive to students with weak algebraic foundations. Based on the provided calibration items, this task is expected to have a mid-range difficulty and moderate discrimination.
