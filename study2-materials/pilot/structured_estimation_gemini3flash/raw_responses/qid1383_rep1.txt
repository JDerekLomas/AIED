The item assesses the application of indices to negative bases, specifically the rule that a negative number raised to an even power results in a positive value. The complexity is relatively low, involving a single substitution and exponential calculation. However, the misconception regarding negative signs and exponents is highly prevalent among the target age group, making the distractors particularly attractive. The item's difficulty is moderated by the simple numerical value chosen, but the abstract nature of the negative base increases the likelihood of error for students with weak conceptual foundations in algebra.
