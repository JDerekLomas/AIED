The item assesses the ability to identify valid algebraic transformations when solving equations with variables on both sides. It specifically targets the inverse operation misconception, where students might add a constant to one side but subtract it from the other, or vice versa, to "move" it. Jo's and Paul's suggestions both involve incorrect sign changes or incorrect applications of the additive inverse, making "Neither" the correct choice. Compared to the calibration items, this requires evaluating two different student claims, which increases the cognitive load and requires a higher level of conceptual verification than simple computation.
