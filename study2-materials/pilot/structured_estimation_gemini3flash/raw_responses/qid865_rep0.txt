The item assesses the ability to link a visual representation of a quadratic graph to its algebraic factored form. It requires identifying roots from x-intercepts and determining the orientation (concavity) of the parabola. The cognitive process involves translating the roots $x=-5$ and $x=1$ into factors $(x+5)$ and $(1-x)$ or $-(x-1)$, then recognizing that a negative $x^2$ coefficient is necessary for an inverted "n-shaped" curve. The distractors are highly plausible as they target common errors in sign manipulation and root-to-factor conversion.
