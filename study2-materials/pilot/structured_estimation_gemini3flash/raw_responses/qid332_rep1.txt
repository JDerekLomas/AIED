The item assesses multi-step linear equation solving, specifically focusing on the order of operations and the application of inverse operations. Tom's method correctly applies the inverse of subtraction first, while Katie's method demonstrates a common misconception where the multiplication is applied to only one term of the numerator rather than the entire side of the equation. This specific structure (two people arguing) increases the cognitive load compared to a standard solve-for-x question, and the misconception regarding distributive properties in fractions is highly prevalent among UK secondary students.
