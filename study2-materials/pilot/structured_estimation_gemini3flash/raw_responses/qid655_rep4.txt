The item assesses the ability to solve a simple multiplicative equation involving negative numbers and fractions. The reasoning focuses on the interplay between algebraic manipulation (dividing by -6) and the sign rules for multiplication and division. Based on the provided calibration examples, items involving sign errors and fractions tend to have moderate difficulty and high discrimination among secondary school students.
