The item assesses the addition of algebraic fractions with common denominators, a foundational skill in the UK secondary curriculum. The reasoning involves identifying the common denominator, applying the rule for adding numerators, and recognizing that the variable $x$ remains unchanged. The primary misconception (adding both numerators and denominators) is highly prevalent, making distractor C particularly attractive. The item is structurally simple but abstract due to the algebraic notation.
