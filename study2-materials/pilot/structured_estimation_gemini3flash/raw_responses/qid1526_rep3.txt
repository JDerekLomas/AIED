The item assesses the addition of fractions with unequal denominators, a foundational secondary school skill. The core complexity arises from the procedural requirement to find a common denominator and adjust numerators accordingly. The visual presentation using a "number wall" or "pyramid" style is standard for UK curricula, though it adds a minor layer of interpretation. Distractors are highly effective, specifically targeting the common misconception of adding numerators and denominators (5/12) and calculation errors in the cross-multiplication process. Based on the calibration examples, items involving procedural fraction arithmetic often show moderate difficulty and high discrimination because the misconception is persistent across ability levels.
