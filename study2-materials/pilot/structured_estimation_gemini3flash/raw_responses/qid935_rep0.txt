The item assesses the ability to substitute a known value into a linear equation and solve for the remaining variable. While framed as "simultaneous equations," the task is functionally a single-step substitution and a two-step linear equation solve ($2j - 8 = -10$). The primary cognitive hurdle is the manipulation of negative numbers and the application of inverse operations. The distractors are well-mapped to common errors: adding 8 to -10 to get positive 18 (leading to $j=9$), or failing to handle the negative sign correctly when dividing. Given the calibration examples, this item sits at a moderate difficulty level for the UK secondary cohort, as substitution is a foundational but often error-prone skill.
