The item assesses quadratic substitution involving negative numbers, a common area for sign errors. The primary cognitive hurdle is squaring a negative integer and correctly handling the subsequent subtraction, leading to the targeted misconception where students evaluate $(-1)^2$ as $-1$ or struggle with $-2(-1)$. Based on the provided calibration items, this type of substitution task typically shows moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
