The item involves adding algebraic fractions with different but related denominators. The primary mathematical steps are identifying a common denominator ($2x$), converting the second fraction through multiplication by 2, and summing the numerators. The misconception tested (adding numerators and denominators) is highly prevalent in this age group, leading students to select option B. Option D represents a failure to find a common denominator while correctly adding numerators, and option C represents a different error in denominator manipulation. Given the alignment with the UK curriculum for KS3/KS4, this item has moderate complexity due to the algebraic nature but benefits from a standard presentation.
