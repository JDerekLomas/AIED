The item assesses the multiplication of directed numbers, specifically the rule that a negative product requires one positive and one negative factor. The concept is fundamental in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The cognitive load is low as it requires checking four options against a single target value, but the presence of distractors targeting common misconceptions—such as adding instead of multiplying (Option C) or sign errors (Option A)—increases the item's effectiveness. Given the simplicity of the arithmetic, the difficulty is expected to be relatively low for the target age group, though the specific misconception regarding negative signs remains a persistent hurdle for lower-attaining students.
