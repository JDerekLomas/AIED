The item asks students to rearrange a standard formula ($A = \frac{1}{2}bh$) for a specific variable ($h$). 

1. **Mathematical analysis**: To isolate $h$, students must multiply by 2 (to remove the fraction) and divide by $b$. This involves two inverse operations.
2. **Distractor analysis**:
    - **A**: Replaces $h$ with $A$ in the original formula. This is a common error where students think "rearranging" just means swapping letters.
    - **C**: $h = A / 2b$. This represents a failure to perform the inverse operation for the fraction. Instead of multiplying by 2, the student has "moved" the 2 to the denominator, effectively dividing by 2 again. This aligns with the "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" misconception mentioned.
    - **D**: "They are all incorrect" is a common "safety net" distractor but rarely chosen by high-ability students unless they are very confident.
3. **Psychometric Comparison**:
    - Compared to the first calibration item ($-5 = p + 10$), this is more complex because it involves two steps and algebraic fractions rather than just integers.
    - Compared to the inequality item ($2n+3 \leq 3n-7$), it is slightly more abstract because it uses only variables, though the steps are fewer.
    - The "proportion correct" for rearranging formulas in UK secondary schools (GCSE Foundation/Higher) tends to be moderate to low (around 0.35 - 0.50).
    - The discrimination is likely to be high because students who understand inverse operations will get this right, while those who don't will be strongly drawn to C or A.
    - Guessing probability: Option D makes a blind guess slightly less likely to be "attractive" than a 3-choice numerical set, but standard 4-choice parameters usually hover around 0.15-0.20 for this age group.
