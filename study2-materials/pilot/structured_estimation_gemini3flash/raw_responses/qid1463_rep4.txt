The item assesses the discriminant part of the quadratic formula, specifically the term \(b^2\). The student must identify that \(b = -3\), and thus \((-3)^2 = 9\). The primary misconception involves the sign of the square of a negative number (obtaining \(-9\)) or confusion with \(2b\). Given the specific focus on a sub-step of a complex formula typically taught at the end of Key Stage 4 (ages 14-16), the item has high prerequisite knowledge requirements and moderate cognitive load. The difficulty is likely to be moderate to high because students often struggle with negative signs in the quadratic formula, though the 4-choice format and specific focus on one part of the expression simplify the procedural execution compared to a full solution.
