The item assesses the ability to rearrange a linear equation from the form ax + by = c into the gradient-intercept form y = mx + c. This requires understanding the concept of a gradient and performing multi-step algebraic manipulation. The process involves subtracting 4x and then dividing by 3, which frequently leads to errors involving signs or the incorrect coefficient being selected as the gradient. The distractors are highly plausible as they represent common partial solutions or sign errors. Based on the complexity of isolating the variable and the commonality of the targeted misconception, this item is expected to have a moderate to high difficulty level for the target age group.
