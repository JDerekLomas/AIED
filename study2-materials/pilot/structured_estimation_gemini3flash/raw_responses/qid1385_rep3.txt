The item assesses fraction addition using common denominators and grouping strategies. While the core concept is fundamental, the specific arrangement of terms allows for a simplification strategy (adding thirds and quarters separately) that may bypass the more laborious common denominator method (converting all to twelfths). The primary misconception—adding numerators and denominators—is represented by option B, which is a highly common error in this age group. The difficulty is likely to be moderate because, although the fractions are simple, the horizontal presentation and the presence of four terms increase the cognitive load compared to a standard two-term addition.
