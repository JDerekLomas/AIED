The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of indices over multiplication. The core challenge lies in resisting the left-to-right processing impulse (which leads to $6^2=36$) or the confusion of indices with multiplication (leading to $2 \times 6 = 12$). Given the simplicity of the numbers and the clear presence of a common misconception, the item is likely to have high discrimination but a relatively low classical difficulty (high proportion correct) among the 11-16 age range, as this is a foundational KS3 topic.
