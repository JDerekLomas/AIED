The item assesses multi-step linear equation solving within a comparative framework (Tom vs. Katie). It specifically targets common errors in inverse operations: Tom incorrectly adds 6 to the right side without clearing the denominator, while Katie incorrectly divides 10 by 2 instead of multiplying. The "Neither" option (D) is the correct answer, which typically increases difficulty as students are often biased toward one character being correct. Based on the calibration items, this structure requires evaluating two distinct incorrect pathways, leading to moderate cognitive load and higher discrimination.
