The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of multiplication over addition. The primary distractor (27) targets the common left-to-right processing error, which is a highly prevalent misconception in the 11-16 age range. Compared to the calibration examples, this item is computationally simpler than the negative number or inequality problems, but the misconception it targets is statistically powerful, often leading to lower-than-expected success rates despite the simple arithmetic.
