The item involves solving a basic algebraic equation where the variable is in the denominator. This structure frequently triggers misconceptions regarding inverse operations, specifically leading students to multiply the constants (resulting in 50) or divide in the incorrect order (resulting in 2). The conceptual demand is moderate for the target age group, as it requires moving beyond one-step linear equations. Based on the calibration items, similar algebraic misconceptions typically result in a difficulty level that sits in the middle of the cohort's ability range, with a relatively low guessing parameter due to the specific attractiveness of the distractors.
