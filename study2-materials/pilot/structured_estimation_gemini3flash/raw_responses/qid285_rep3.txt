The item involves rearranging a formula with two operations: multiplication and squaring. The reasoning process evaluates the complexity of isolating a squared variable, the commonality of inverse operation errors (specifically regarding square roots and division), and the typical performance of UK students in Key Stage 4 (ages 14-16) on literal equations. Based on the calibration items, this question is more abstract than basic linear equations but follows a standard procedural format.
