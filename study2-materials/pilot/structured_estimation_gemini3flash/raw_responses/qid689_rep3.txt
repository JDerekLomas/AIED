The item assesses the ability to solve a one-step equation where the variable is in the denominator. This structure frequently triggers the misconception of applying the inverse operation to the wrong number (e.g., calculating $10 \times 5$ or $10 \div 5$) rather than correctly isolating the variable. While the arithmetic is simple, the algebraic structure is a common stumbling block for students who rely on rote procedural patterns.
