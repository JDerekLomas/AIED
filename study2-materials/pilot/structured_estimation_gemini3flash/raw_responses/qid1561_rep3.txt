The item involves a standard two-step linear equation. The reasoning process involves identifying the operations required (addition of 5, then division by 20) and anticipating common student errors. Distractors target sign errors (inverse operation failure) and the common "larger divided by smaller" error (getting 4 instead of 1/4). Based on the calibration items, this item is relatively straightforward for the target age group but contains a common reciprocal trap.
