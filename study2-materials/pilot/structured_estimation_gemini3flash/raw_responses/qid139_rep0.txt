The item assesses the multiplication of two negative integers within the context of binomial expansion. Reasoning involves identifying the specific terms indicated (-4 and -3), applying the multiplication operation, and correctly determining the sign of the product. The complexity is relatively low as it isolates a single step of the FOIL/grid method, though the common misconception regarding negative signs is a significant factor in distractor attractiveness.
