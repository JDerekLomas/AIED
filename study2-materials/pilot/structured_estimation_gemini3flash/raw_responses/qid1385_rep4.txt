The item assesses fraction addition using pairs with common denominators. Reasoning involves identifying that students may either use the efficient method of grouping (1/3 + 2/3 and 1/4 + 3/4) to reach 1 + 1 = 2, or fall into the common misconception of adding numerators and denominators (giving 7/14). The item is highly clear and uses standard notation for the UK curriculum, though the presence of an integer answer among fractions may influence guessing behavior or self-correction for higher-ability students.
