The item assesses the fundamental understanding of inverse operations within the context of linear equations, specifically isolating a variable by dividing by its coefficient. The task is conceptually simple but targets a common misconception where students apply the operation shown (multiplication by 9) rather than its inverse. Given the visual representation of the "operation star" and the clear transition from 9y to y, the cognitive load is low, but the distractor representing the inverse error (Option B) or the additive error (Option D) are highly plausible for students at this stage of algebraic development.
