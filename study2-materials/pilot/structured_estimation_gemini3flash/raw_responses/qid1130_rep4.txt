The item requires students to integrate geometric properties (angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees) with algebraic manipulation (combining like terms and solving a linear equation). The cognitive load is moderate as it involves setting up an equation from a visual representation. The identified misconception relates to inverse operations during the final stages of solving the equation $10x + 30 = 180$. Predictions are based on the complexity of combining these two distinct domains and the likelihood of arithmetic errors in the simplification process.
