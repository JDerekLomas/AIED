The item involves solving a linear equation with variables on both sides, requiring multiple steps: collecting terms and isolating the variable using inverse operations. I have assessed the cognitive load as moderate due to the potential for sign errors and the specific distractors designed to catch students who fail to use inverse operations correctly. The difficulty is likely slightly higher than a basic one-step equation but remains a standard curriculum requirement for the 11-16 age range.
