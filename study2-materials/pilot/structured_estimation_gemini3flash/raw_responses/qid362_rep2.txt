The item assesses the ability to rearrange a linear equation from standard form ($ax + by = c$) to slope-intercept form ($y = mx + c$) to identify the gradient. This requires understanding the concept of gradient, algebraic manipulation involving multiple steps (subtracting $4x$ and dividing by $3$), and handling negative signs. The distractors are highly plausible, targeting common errors such as identifying the coefficient of $x$ without rearranging or failing to apply the inverse operation (division). Based on the calibration items, multi-step algebraic rearrangement typically presents a moderate to high challenge for the target age group, leading to a difficulty parameter in the mid-range of the scale.
