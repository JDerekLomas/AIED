The item assesses the expansion of a single bracket involving a negative multiplier and a negative constant term. I evaluated the complexity of the sign rules, noting that the primary hurdle is the multiplication of two negatives. Based on the calibration examples, items involving algebraic sign errors typically show high discrimination and moderate difficulty within the UK secondary curriculum.
