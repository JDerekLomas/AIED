The item is a one-step linear equation involving negative integers, which is a foundational skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The reasoning involves identifying the inverse operation (subtraction) and correctly applying it to a negative starting value (-3 - 12 = -15). The distractors are highly plausible because they represent common arithmetic errors: adding instead of subtracting (Option A: -3 + 12 = 9), ignoring the negative sign (Option D: 3 + 12 = 15), or failing to move both values correctly (Option C: 12 - 3 = 9, then misapplying a sign). Based on the calibration example "-5=p+10", which had a very low success rate, this item is expected to be difficult for the average student due to the cognitive load of combining algebraic manipulation with negative number arithmetic.
