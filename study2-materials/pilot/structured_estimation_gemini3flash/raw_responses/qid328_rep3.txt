The item assesses basic fraction addition with unequal denominators, a fundamental skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The reasoning involves identifying that the denominators are different, finding a common denominator (9), converting the second fraction, and performing the addition. The distractors are highly effective, particularly Option B (adding numerators and denominators), which represents one of the most common misconceptions in secondary mathematics. Given the prevalence of this error, the item is expected to have a relatively high difficulty level despite its procedural simplicity.
