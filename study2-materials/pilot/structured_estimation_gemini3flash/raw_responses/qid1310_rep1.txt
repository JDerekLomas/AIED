The item assesses the fundamental understanding of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically focusing on the hierarchy of nested brackets. The reasoning identifies that students must recognize the innermost parentheses must be resolved first. The difficulty is moderated because the question asks for the "first step" rather than a full numerical evaluation, which reduces cognitive load and procedural steps. Distractor analysis suggests that students following a strict left-to-right approach or misinterpreting the decimal notation within the brackets are the primary targets for error.
