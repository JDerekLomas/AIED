The item assesses basic fraction addition with common denominators followed by simplifying the result. The reasoning involves identifying the primary misconception (adding both numerators and denominators) which leads to distractor A, and the secondary hurdle of simplifying 8/10 to 4/5, which distinguishes between partial and full mastery. Given the simplicity of the arithmetic but the commonality of the error, the difficulty is expected to be relatively low for the 11-16 age range, though the requirement for "simplest form" increases the discrimination between students who can perform the operation and those who can follow complete instructions.
