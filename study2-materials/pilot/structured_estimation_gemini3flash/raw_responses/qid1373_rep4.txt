The item assesses basic algebraic expansion involving negative numbers, a fundamental skill in the UK Key Stage 3 and 4 curriculum. The primary cognitive hurdle is the application of the sign rule (negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive) during the distributive process. Given that the distractors systematically cover common errors—sign errors on the first term, second term, or both—the item effectively isolates the specific misconception. Based on the provided calibration items, particularly those involving negative number operations and algebraic manipulation, this item is expected to have a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination, as the error is a classic "trap" for students with incomplete procedural fluency in directed numbers.
