The item assesses the ability to solve a linear equation involving fractions, requiring students to apply inverse operations (multiplication followed by addition). The difficulty lies in the fractional result and the common misconception of applying the same operation rather than the inverse, or incorrectly manipulating the denominator. Based on the provided calibration examples, multi-step algebraic manipulation typically results in moderate discrimination and difficulty parameters.
