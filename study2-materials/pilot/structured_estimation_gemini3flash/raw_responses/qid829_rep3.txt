The item assesses the expansion of a quadratic expression with negative coefficients, specifically targeting the multiplication of two negative integers. I evaluated the procedural complexity involving the FOIL method or grid method and compared it to the calibration items, noting that while the operation is standard, the sign management increases the likelihood of specific errors. I then estimated the psychometric parameters by considering the attractiveness of distractors that appeal to common misconceptions regarding integer addition and multiplication.
