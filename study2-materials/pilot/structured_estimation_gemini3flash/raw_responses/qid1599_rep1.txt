The item assesses the fundamental algebraic convention of representing division as a fraction. I analyzed the cognitive demands by evaluating the transition from arithmetic notation to algebraic syntax, noting that the primary barrier is the structural recognition of the denominator. The distractors effectively target common errors in order of operations and partial application of the division operator. I estimated the psychometric parameters by comparing this foundational skill to the more complex operations in the calibration set, concluding it has lower procedural complexity but high diagnostic value for early secondary students.
