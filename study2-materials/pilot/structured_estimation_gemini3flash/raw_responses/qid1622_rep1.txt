The item assesses the ability to substitute values into a linear equation and solve for the unknown variable. The cognitive process involves substituting $x=0$, simplifying the equation to $2y=6$, and applying the inverse operation of division. The distractors are designed to capture common errors: Option B ($y=2$) might arise from confusing coefficients; Option D ($y=12$) suggests a multiplication error ($6 \times 2$); Option C ($y=1.5$) could result from an incorrect division ($3 \div 2$). Compared to the calibration items, the presence of a zero substitution simplifies the arithmetic significantly, making it more accessible than the inequality or negative number items, though the tabular format adds a slight layer of visual interpretation.
