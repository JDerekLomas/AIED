The item assesses the fundamental understanding of inverse operations within the context of linear equations. It requires identifying that adding 7 is the inverse of subtracting 7 to isolate the variable. While the concept is foundational, the visual presentation using a "star" and function-machine-style logic introduces a slight layer of abstraction compared to standard symbolic manipulation. Distractors are moderately plausible as they represent common errors like repeating the operation or misidentifying the relationship between terms.
