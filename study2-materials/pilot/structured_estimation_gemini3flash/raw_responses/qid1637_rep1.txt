The item assesses the ability to solve a two-sided linear inequality, requiring the application of inverse operations to all three parts of the expression simultaneously. Reasoning involves identifying the two-step process (subtracting 1, then dividing by 2) and evaluating the common pitfalls where students might only apply operations to one side or fail to use inverse operations correctly. Based on the calibration examples, multi-step algebraic manipulation typically results in higher IRT difficulty parameters and moderate discrimination.
