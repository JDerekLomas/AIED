The item assesses the ability to substitute a value into a linear equation with two variables and solve for the remaining variable. The substitution $x=0$ simplifies the equation to $2y=10$, which is a foundational algebraic skill for UK secondary students. The distractors target common errors such as incorrect operations (e.g., $10 \times 2$ or $10 \div 4$) and partial processing of the equation. Compared to the calibration examples, this task is relatively straightforward but requires a clear understanding of algebraic notation and inverse operations.
