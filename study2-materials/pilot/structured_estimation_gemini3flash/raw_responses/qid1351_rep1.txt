The item is a fundamental linear equation involving negative numbers, closely mirroring the first calibration example. I evaluated the cognitive demand of managing directed numbers alongside the inverse operation of subtraction. The distractors are strategically chosen to capture common errors in integer arithmetic and operation selection, leading to a prediction of moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
