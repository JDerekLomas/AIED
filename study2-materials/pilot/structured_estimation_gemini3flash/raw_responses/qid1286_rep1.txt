The item assesses the ability to rearrange the formula for the volume of a sphere to make the radius the subject. This requires knowledge of the specific formula, the ability to perform inverse operations (multiplying by 3, dividing by 4 and pi), and applying a cube root. The algebraic manipulation is abstract as it involves no numerical simplification, increasing the cognitive load. Distractors are well-designed to catch students who invert operations incorrectly or apply operations to the wrong parts of the fraction. Based on the provided calibration examples, this multi-step algebraic rearrangement is typically more difficult than basic linear equations but possesses high discrimination.
