The item assesses understanding of the commutative property and the order of operations by presenting two statements for verification. I evaluated the cognitive load required to compare the left and right sides of both Tom's and Katie's expressions, noting that while the arithmetic is simple, the misconception regarding rigid left-to-right processing often leads students to incorrectly judge the validity of rearranged operations. I then estimated the psychometric parameters by comparing this item's structure and conceptual depth to the provided calibration examples, specifically focusing on how the "Both" option interacts with common student errors in BIDMAS/BODMAS.
