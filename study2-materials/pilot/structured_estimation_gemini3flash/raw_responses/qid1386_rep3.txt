The item assesses the addition of algebraic fractions with a common denominator. This is a foundational skill in the UK secondary curriculum, typically introduced at Key Stage 3. The primary misconception involves adding the denominators (Option C), which is a high-frequency error in fraction arithmetic. Option A reflects an over-complication of equivalent fractions, and Option D reflects a confusion between addition and multiplication rules. Given the simplicity of the common denominator, the cognitive load is low, but the prevalence of the "add across" misconception often leads to lower-than-expected performance in younger cohorts.
