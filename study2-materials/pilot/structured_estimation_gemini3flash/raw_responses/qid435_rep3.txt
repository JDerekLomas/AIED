The item evaluates the application of order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with negative number arithmetic across four distinct expressions. The target expression (Option B) requires calculating -28 - (-8), which tests the common misconception of sign handling in subtraction and multiplication. The cognitive load is relatively high as students must evaluate multiple options to find the correct one, and the distractors are designed to capture common errors in squaring negatives and sign rules.
