The item assesses the addition of algebraic fractions with common denominators. The reasoning involves evaluating the simplicity of the task (keeping the denominator the same while adding numerators) against the high prevalence of the "add both numerators and denominators" misconception. Based on the provided calibration items, algebraic items with common misconceptions often show lower classical difficulty than expected, but this specific task is a foundational skill in the UK secondary curriculum, leading to a moderate difficulty profile.
