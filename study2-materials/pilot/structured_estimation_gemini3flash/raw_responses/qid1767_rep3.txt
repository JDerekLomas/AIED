The item assesses the fundamental understanding of inverse operations within the context of linear equations. It requires identifying the correct operation to isolate a variable when a constant is subtracted. While the concept is foundational (Year 7/8 in the UK), the presentation uses a visual "function machine" style logic which is common in diagnostic assessments but slightly different from standard algebraic manipulation. The primary distractor is the use of the same operation rather than the inverse, a very common misconception in early algebra. Given the simplicity of the single-step operation but the abstract nature of identifying the *process* rather than the *result*, the item is expected to have high clarity and moderate difficulty for the lower end of the age range.
