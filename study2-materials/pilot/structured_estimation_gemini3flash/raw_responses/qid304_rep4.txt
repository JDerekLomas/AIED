<chain_of_thought>
The item assesses basic order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) by asking for the first step rather than the final result. While the concept is foundational for the 11-16 age group, the left-to-right misconception remains persistent among lower-ability students. The inclusion of parentheses makes the rule explicit, which typically increases the success rate compared to items requiring implicit hierarchy (like multiplication vs. addition). The prompt is clear and the distractors directly target common errors, but the overall complexity is low.
