The item assesses the discriminant part of the quadratic formula, specifically evaluating $(-b)^2$. The primary cognitive hurdle involves squaring a negative coefficient, where students frequently err by producing a negative result (e.g., $-3^2 = -9$). While the quadratic formula is a high-tier GCSE concept, this specific question isolates a single component of the substitution process, reducing procedural complexity but targeting a persistent arithmetic misconception. The notation is slightly non-standard due to the use of symbols (triangle), which increases the abstraction level and cognitive load. Comparisons with calibration items suggest that while the math is advanced, the specific error targeted is very common among students at this level, leading to moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
