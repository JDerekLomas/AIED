The item assesses basic integer multiplication and the sign rules associated with products. The reasoning involves evaluating the mathematical operation for each option while specifically addressing the misconception that two negatives result in a negative product. Given the simplicity of the arithmetic (single-digit multiplication) and the directness of the prompt, the cognitive load is low, but the misconception regarding negative signs is a well-documented stumbling block for students in this age bracket.
