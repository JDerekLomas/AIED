The item assesses basic algebraic substitution and solving a linear equation. The complexity is relatively low as it involves only two steps: substituting the known value and isolating the variable. The distractors are strategically designed to capture common errors in directed number arithmetic and inverse operations, which are typical for this age group (UK secondary). Based on the calibration items, the difficulty is moderate, as students often struggle with negative results and the "same operation" misconception.
