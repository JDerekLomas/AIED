The item assesses the ability to find the y-intercept of a quadratic function in factored form, which requires substituting x=0 and evaluating the resulting product. The primary cognitive hurdle is the multiplication of two negative integers (-8 and -6), while distractors target common errors such as adding the constants or confusing the y-intercept with the x-intercepts. Based on the provided calibration examples, this item sits at a moderate difficulty level for the target age group, as it combines coordinate geometry concepts with basic arithmetic rules.
