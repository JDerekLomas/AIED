The item assesses the ability to identify errors in algebraic manipulation, specifically involving inverse operations and the order of operations in two-step equations. Tom's error involves adding 6 before dealing with the denominator (ignoring the grouping of the numerator), while Katie's error involves dividing the right side by 2 instead of multiplying. Both represent common misconceptions regarding inverse operations and the structure of linear equations. The "Neither is correct" format typically increases difficulty compared to direct solving, as students must evaluate two separate logical paths.
