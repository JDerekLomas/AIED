The item assesses the understanding of the mean average, specifically focusing on the inclusion of zero in the count of values and the correct application of the order of operations (BIDMAS) when writing a calculation. The presence of zero is a common stumbling block; students often believe it "doesn't count" toward the denominator (Option C). Option B targets students who understand the sum/count relationship but fail to use parentheses or a fraction bar, leading to a calculation where only the last digit is divided by 5. The conceptual load is relatively low, but the distractors are highly effective at capturing common procedural errors.
