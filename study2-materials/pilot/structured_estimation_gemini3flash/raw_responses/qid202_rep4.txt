The item assesses the addition of mixed numbers with common denominators, a foundational skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The process involves adding whole numbers and numerators separately while maintaining the denominator, or converting to improper fractions. Distractors target common misconceptions such as adding denominators (Option D) and converting to improper fractions without returning to mixed number form (Option B). The cognitive load is low due to the lack of regrouping required, making the item relatively straightforward for the target age group.
