The item assesses the expansion of a squared binomial, a core algebraic skill in the UK secondary curriculum. The reasoning involves recognizing that $(x-3)^2$ equals $(x-3)(x-3)$ and correctly applying the distributive law. The primary challenge for students lies in the sign of the constant term $(-3 \times -3 = +9)$ and the middle term $(-3x - 3x = -6x)$. Common errors involve squaring individual terms or misapplying signs, making the distractors highly plausible for students with weak negative number fluency or algebraic misconceptions.
