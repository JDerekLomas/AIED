The item involves a two-step linear equation requiring the application of inverse operations (addition and division). The reasoning evaluates the likely student errors, specifically the confusion between operations (subtraction vs. addition) and the common error of dividing the coefficient by the constant (12/3) rather than the constant by the coefficient (3/12). Based on the calibration items, this type of algebraic manipulation typically shows moderate discrimination and a difficulty level slightly below the mean for the target age group.
