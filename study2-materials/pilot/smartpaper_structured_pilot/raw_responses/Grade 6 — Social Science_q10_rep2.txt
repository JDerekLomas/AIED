The target item asks students to name two important fairs or festivals celebrated in Rajasthan and describe one in a single sentence. The maximum score is 1, and the rubric states "For correctly naming any two distinct important fairs or festivals celebrated in Rajasthan." This is a crucial point: the rubric *only* awards points for naming two fairs/festivals, not for the description. This makes the question effectively a two-part task where only the first part is scored. This could lead to confusion for students who might spend time on the description, or for scorers if they aren't strictly adhering to the rubric. Given the rubric, the question is effectively a recall task.

Let's break down the components and compare to calibration items:

**Part 1: Naming two fairs/festivals**
*   **Concept Complexity:** Low. It's direct recall of facts. (Similar to identifying a verb phrase, but perhaps slightly more open-ended in terms of possible answers).
*   **Procedural Steps:** 1 (recall and list two names).
*   **Abstraction Level:** Concrete recall (1). No analysis or evaluation needed.
*   **Prerequisite Knowledge:** Requires specific knowledge of Rajasthani culture/history, which should be covered in Grade 6 Social Science. This is factual recall.
*   **Rubric Specificity:** High (10). It's very specific: two distinct, *important* fairs/festivals *in Rajasthan*. There's a clear right/wrong for each name.
*   **Common Error Likelihood:** Moderate. Students might name only one, name a festival from another state, or misspell.
*   **Question Clarity:** High (9). "Name any two important fairs or festivals celebrated in Rajasthan" is quite clear.

**Part 2 (Unscored based on rubric): Describe one in one sentence.**
*   This part of the question adds to cognitive load and language demand, but does not contribute to the score. This is a significant mismatch between question and rubric. For the purpose of psychometric analysis, I must consider the *scored* component. However, the *presence* of the unscored part will likely influence student behavior (time spent, mental effort) and potentially their overall engagement/frustration. This could indirectly affect performance on the scored part if they get stuck on the description.

**Overall Psychometric Judgment (based on scored part):**

*   **Concept Complexity:** Low. Just recall. (2)
*   **Procedural Steps:** Low. Recall two items. (2)
*   **Abstraction Level:** Very low. Factual recall. (1)
*   **Prerequisite Knowledge:** Moderate. Specific cultural knowledge for Rajasthan. Assumed to be covered, but coverage quality can vary. (5)
*   **Rubric Specificity:** Very high. Either they name two correct ones or they don't. (9)
*   **Common Error Likelihood:** Moderate. Students might only name one, name an incorrect one, or struggle with recall. The "important" qualifier might also pose a slight challenge if they recall less prominent ones. (6)
*   **Question Clarity:** High. The scored part is clear. The presence of the unscored part makes the overall question slightly less clear in terms of what's *expected for points*. (8, slightly reduced due to the unscored part creating a potential distraction/misdirection).
*   **Cognitive Load:** Low for the scored part (recall two names). Medium for the full question if students attempt the description. Since the description is not scored, I'll rate for the scored part primarily, but acknowledge the slight increase due to the misleading instruction. (3)
*   **Age Appropriateness:** High. Grade 6 Social Science often covers local culture and history. (9)
*   **Transfer Distance:** Low. Direct recall from curriculum. (2)
*   **Language Demand:** Low for the scored part (listing two names). Higher for the full question, but not for scoring. (3, for the required output).
*   **Response Precision:** High. Names must be correct. (8)

**Comparison to Calibration Items:**

*   **"Evaluate key differences between public and private healthcare..." (Difficulty 0.881, Mean Prop 0.119):** This is much harder. It requires evaluation, comparison, and argument, not just recall. My target item is significantly easier.
*   **"Identify the verb phrase..." (Difficulty 0.808, Mean Prop 0.192):** This is also recall, but specific grammatical identification. The target item is also recall, but of general knowledge. I think identifying a verb phrase might be slightly harder for some students than recalling two common festivals if taught well.
*   **"Which line from the poem do you like..." (Difficulty 0.742, Mean Prop 0.258):** This requires personal opinion and justification, making it more complex and open-ended. My target item is simpler recall.
*   **"Suggest ways to improve transparency..." (Difficulty 0.653, Mean Prop 0.347):** This requires critical thinking and suggestion, much harder than simple recall.
*   **"Probability of drawing a black ball" (Difficulty 0.468, Mean Prop 0.532):** This is a math problem requiring application of a formula/concept. It's more procedural than my target item.

The target item is a straightforward recall task. The biggest issue is the mismatch between the question (asking for description) and the rubric (only scoring the names). If students *only* needed to name two festivals, this would be a relatively easy item, assuming proper curriculum coverage. The presence of the unscored description part might make some students overthink or spend unnecessary time, or even miss the core requirement if they focus too much on the description. However, the rubric is very clear: "For correctly naming any two distinct important fairs or festivals celebrated in Rajasthan." This means the description part literally yields zero points.

Given that it's a Grade 6 Social Science item focused on local culture, and assuming decent curriculum coverage, naming two common festivals should be manageable for a good portion of students. Examples like Pushkar Fair, Gangaur, Teej, Urs, Desert Festival, etc., are widely known.

The classical difficulty (prop scoring 0) should be relatively low, meaning a higher proportion of students will score points. It's easier than the English verb phrase identification and significantly easier than the Social Science items requiring evaluation or suggestion. It's probably easier than the math probability question as well, as it's pure recall.

I'd expect a good number of students to be able to recall two names. Perhaps 40-50% might get it right. This would place the classical difficulty between 0.5 and 0.6. The mean score proportion would then be between 0.4 and 0.5.

Item-total correlation: Since it's a clear recall task, students who generally perform well in Social Science and have good recall skills are likely to get this right. It should discriminate well. The clarity of the rubric (even if the question is slightly muddled) helps here. I'd expect a decent correlation, similar to the math probability question or the "Which line from the poem..." item. The Social Science "transparency" item has a very high correlation (0.642), likely because it's a good discriminator for deeper understanding. My item is simpler recall, so perhaps slightly lower, but still solid.

Let's refine the difficulty. Compared to the 'verb phrase' (0.808) and 'poem line' (0.742) which have lower mean score proportions, this social science recall might be slightly easier. The 'transparency' question (0.653) is much harder as it requires higher-order thinking. The 'public vs private healthcare' (0.881) is even harder. The math probability (0.468) is the easiest of the calibration items in terms of classical difficulty (most students got points).

Recalling two specific names from a cultural topic for Grade 6 might be challenging for some, especially if their local curriculum exposure isn't strong or if they struggle with rote memorization. However, major festivals are usually well-covered. The fact that the description part is unscored *for points* makes it simpler than it appears. If the rubric *did* score the description, it would be harder.

I think the difficulty will be higher than the Math probability (0.468) but lower than the English 'verb phrase' (0.808). It's a factual recall, but requires recalling *two* specific items, and then ignoring the instruction to describe. This might trip some up. I'll place it closer to the slightly harder end of the easy items.

Let's assume a significant portion of students will get this right. If 40-50% get it right, then the classical difficulty is 0.5-0.6.
If we compare it to the "Identify the verb phrase" item (difficulty 0.808), which is also recall but of a grammatical structure, I think recalling two festivals from a social science context might be slightly easier for Grade 6 Indian students, given the cultural relevance. So, difficulty should be lower than 0.808.

I'll estimate a classical difficulty around 0.6. This means about 40% of students will get full marks. This aligns it with the "Suggest ways to improve transparency" question in terms of proportion of students *not* scoring, but the *type* of task is vastly different. The transparency question is harder cognitively but might have a broader range of acceptable answers. My item is simpler cognitively but has very specific correct answers.

The fact that it's a 1-mark question for naming two items, and the description is ignored, makes it a bit tricky. If students only name one, they get 0. If they name two, they get 1. This binary scoring based on two specific items makes it quite precise.

Let's consider the average student. Would they know two important festivals of Rajasthan? Most likely, yes, if taught.
What about the item-total correlation? It's a clear-cut factual question. Students who are generally attentive in Social Science and have good recall should do well. It should correlate reasonably well with overall Social Science performance. Not as high as the "transparency" question (0.642) which tests deeper understanding, but possibly similar to the "verb phrase" (0.386) or "poem line" (0.467) which test specific skills/recall. I'll go with a moderate correlation.
