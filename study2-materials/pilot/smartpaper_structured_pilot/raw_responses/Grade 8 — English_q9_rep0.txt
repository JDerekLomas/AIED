The target item asks for a synonym and an antonym for the word "quiet". The maximum score is 1. The rubric, however, *only* specifies giving an appropriate synonym for 'quiet'. This is a critical discrepancy. If the rubric only scores the synonym, then half the question (the antonym part) is unscored, making the question potentially misleading to students or causing confusion for scorers. For the purpose of this analysis, I will assume the rubric *should* have been structured to award 0.5 for a correct synonym and 0.5 for a correct antonym, or that the question implicitly only requires the synonym for scoring, despite asking for both. Given the provided rubric "Gives an appropriate synonym for 'quiet' (e.g. silent, calm, peaceful, still)", and Max Score 1, it implies only the synonym is scored for the full mark. This makes the question effectively "Give the synonym of the word 'quiet'". This simplification will influence my ratings.

Let's re-evaluate based on the *explicit* rubric: "Gives an appropriate synonym for 'quiet'". The question *asks* for both. This is a poorly designed item if the rubric only scores one part. However, as an expert psychometrician, I must base my analysis on the provided rubric. If the rubric only scores the synonym, then the question is effectively asking for a synonym, and the antonym part is a distractor or an un-scored component.

**Re-evaluation with explicit rubric (only synonym scored for 1 mark):**
*   **Concept Complexity:** Requires understanding of "synonym" and the meaning of "quiet". Relatively low.
*   **Procedural Steps:** 1. Understand "quiet". 2. Recall or infer a word with similar meaning. 3. Write it down. (The antonym part is ignored for scoring).
*   **Abstraction Level:** Concrete recall of vocabulary.
*   **Prerequisite Knowledge:** Basic vocabulary knowledge appropriate for Grade 8. "Quiet" is a common word.
*   **Rubric Specificity:** The rubric is specific for the synonym. "appropriate synonym" allows for a range of correct answers, but the concept is clear.
*   **Common Error Likelihood:** Students might give antonyms instead of synonyms (if they misread or misunderstand the term), or give incorrect synonyms. They might also provide an antonym thinking it's required, but it won't be scored.
*   **Question Clarity:** The question itself is clear in what it asks (both synonym and antonym). However, the scoring rubric makes it ambiguous from a psychometric perspective (only scoring the synonym). Assuming students understand they only need to provide a synonym to get full marks (which is unlikely without explicit instruction), or that they will simply answer both and only one part will be evaluated. This could lead to frustration. For rating clarity, I'll assume the *student's task* is clear, even if the scoring is not.
*   **Cognitive Load:** Low. Recalling one word.
*   **Age Appropriateness:** Very appropriate for Grade 8 English vocabulary.
*   **Transfer Distance:** Direct recall of vocabulary. Very close to standard textbook exercises.
*   **Language Demand:** Low. Understanding "synonym" and "antonym" and writing one word.
*   **Response Precision:** Needs to be a correct synonym. Not exact wording, but semantically correct.

**Comparison with Calibration Examples:**

*   **English Grade 6 - Verb Phrase (difficulty 0.808, mean 0.192):** This was identifying a specific grammatical structure. The target item is vocabulary recall. Verb phrase identification is often trickier than synonym recall for common words. "Are playing" is specific.
*   **English Grade 6 - Poem Line (difficulty 0.742, mean 0.258):** This required subjective interpretation and justification, which is more complex and open-ended. The target item is more factual recall.
*   **Social Science Grade 7 - Healthcare (difficulty 0.881, mean 0.119):** This required evaluation and examples, a higher-order thinking skill. Much harder.
*   **Social Science Grade 7 - Governance (difficulty 0.653, mean 0.347):** This required suggestion of ways to improve, a moderate-level thinking skill.
*   **Math Grade 8 - Probability (difficulty 0.468, mean 0.532):** This involved calculation and understanding of probability, which often has a higher success rate for students who grasp the concept.

The word "quiet" is very common. Finding a synonym like "silent" or "calm" should be relatively easy for a Grade 8 student. The main challenge might be understanding what a "synonym" is, or confusing it with "antonym". However, by Grade 8, these terms should be part of the standard curriculum. The fact that the question asks for both, but the rubric only scores the synonym, will likely lead to some students providing an antonym and getting 0 (if they confuse the terms or only give the antonym) or providing both and still only being scored on the synonym.

If the rubric truly only scores the synonym, then the task is simpler than it appears. Many students should be able to provide a synonym for "quiet".
The "English Grade 6 - Verb Phrase" (difficulty 0.808) shows that even simple identification tasks can have high difficulty. However, "are playing" is a specific grammatical construction, while "quiet" is a common adjective. Synonyms for common words are often taught explicitly.

I expect the classical difficulty to be lower than the verb phrase identification, but higher than the Math problem. The discrepancy between question and rubric might increase difficulty if students spend time on the antonym or get confused. However, for a common word like "quiet", many students will know at least one synonym.

Let's assume the scorers are strictly following the rubric and only scoring the synonym.
The skill is vocabulary. "Quiet" is a basic word. Synonyms like "silent", "calm" are common.
I anticipate a moderate to low difficulty.
The item-total correlation should be decent as vocabulary knowledge is a good indicator of overall English proficiency.

Considering the Grade 8 level, students should mostly be familiar with "synonym" and "antonym". The most likely errors are:
1.  Confusing synonym with antonym.
2.  Providing an incorrect synonym.
3.  Providing an antonym instead of a synonym (which won't be scored if the rubric is strictly followed).

The classical difficulty for the Grade 6 English items (verb phrase, poem line) are 0.808 and 0.742, respectively. These are quite high difficulties for Grade 6. Grade 8 students should have a better grasp of vocabulary.
If we consider the actual task (providing a synonym for 'quiet'), it's a relatively straightforward vocabulary recall. I would expect a higher success rate than the Grade 6 English items.
Compared to "Suggest ways to improve transparency in governance" (difficulty 0.653), this vocabulary task is much more concrete and less demanding of higher-order thinking.

Therefore, I predict a lower difficulty (higher mean score proportion) than the 0.653 of the governance item.
Let's consider possible scores:
*   Correct synonym: 1
*   Incorrect synonym / Antonym / No answer: 0

The word "quiet" is very fundamental. I would expect a good portion of Grade 8 students to know a synonym.
My initial thought is a difficulty around 0.5-0.6.
Item-total correlation should be good because vocabulary is a strong component of general language ability.

Let's refine the ratings based on the *actual* rubric: "Gives an appropriate synonym for 'quiet'". The fact that the question asks for both but only one is scored is an item design flaw, but I must rate the item as it is presented for scoring.

*   **concept_complexity:** 2 (Understanding "synonym" and "quiet").
*   **procedural_steps:** 1 (Recall one word).
*   **abstraction_level:** 2 (Direct recall, low abstraction).
*   **prerequisite_knowledge:** 3 (Basic vocabulary for Grade 8).
*   **rubric_specificity:** 8 (Specific in what it looks for, but allows for multiple correct synonyms).
*   **common_error_likelihood:** 6 (Confusion between synonym/antonym, or incorrect synonym). The fact that 'antonym' is explicitly asked for but not scored adds to confusion and potential errors leading to 0.
*   **question_clarity:** 6 (The question itself is clear, but the mismatch with the rubric creates ambiguity for the student's task if they knew the rubric). Assuming students just answer the question as asked, it's clear. But the *scoring* clarity is low. I'll rate question clarity based on what the student reads. It asks for two things.
*   **cognitive_load:** 2 (Recalling two words, though only one is scored).
*   **age_appropriateness:** 9 (Perfectly appropriate for Grade 8 vocabulary).
*   **transfer_distance:** 1 (Direct vocabulary recall, standard exercise).
*   **language_demand:** 2 (Understand terms, write two words).
*   **response_precision:** 8 (Needs to be a valid synonym, not exact wording).

**Predicting parameters:**
*   **Classical difficulty (prop scoring 0):** Given the commonality of "quiet" and its synonyms, and Grade 8 level, many students should be able to provide a correct synonym. However, the confusion with "antonym" might trip some up. The Grade 6 English items were quite hard (0.808, 0.742). This is Grade 8, and a very common word. I'd expect better performance. If we compare to Social Science "Suggest ways to improve transparency in governance" (0.653), which requires more thought, this vocabulary item should be easier. My estimate is around 0.55-0.60. Let's go with 0.58.
*   **Mean score proportion:** This would be 1 - classical difficulty. So, 1 - 0.58 = 0.42.
*   **Item-total correlation:** Vocabulary is a fundamental skill. It should correlate well with overall English ability. The calibration items show correlations from 0.386 to 0.642. For a direct vocabulary recall for a common word, it should be a solid contributor. I'd place it in the higher middle range. Perhaps 0.55.
