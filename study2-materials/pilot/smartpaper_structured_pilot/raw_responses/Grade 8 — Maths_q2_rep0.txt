The student needs to apply the distributive property (or FOIL method) to multiply two binomials. This involves several steps:
1.  Identify the terms in each binomial.
2.  Multiply the first term of the first binomial by each term of the second binomial.
3.  Multiply the second term of the first binomial by each term of the second binomial.
4.  Combine like terms.

The concepts involved are algebraic expressions, multiplication of monomials, and combining like terms. These are standard topics for Grade 8 mathematics.

Let's break down the process:
`(3a – 2b)` and `(2a + 3b)`

Step 1: `3a * 2a = 6a²`
Step 2: `3a * 3b = 9ab`
Step 3: `-2b * 2a = -4ab`
Step 4: `-2b * 3b = -6b²`

Resulting expression: `6a² + 9ab - 4ab - 6b²`

Step 5: Combine like terms: `9ab - 4ab = 5ab`

Final answer: `6a² + 5ab - 6b²`

The rubric states: "Shows correct expansion of the product, e.g., 3a(2a+3b) - 2b(2a+3b) or 6a² + 9ab - 4ab - 6b²." This means the student does *not* necessarily need to combine like terms for the full score, as long as the expansion is correct. This makes the item slightly easier than if the final simplified form were required. However, the example given for the full score *does* show the expansion before combining like terms, suggesting that the initial multiplication is the key. If the student only provides the final simplified answer, it might still count, but the rubric emphasizes the 'expansion'. Given "Shows correct expansion", I interpret this as getting to the `6a² + 9ab - 4ab - 6b²` stage.

Comparing to calibration items:
-   **Math (Probability):** Difficulty 0.468, Mean score 0.532. This was a conceptual understanding of probability, involving identifying total and favorable outcomes. It's a single calculation.
-   **Social Science (Healthcare):** Difficulty 0.881, Mean score 0.119. This was a complex analytical question requiring recall and argument formulation.
-   **English (Verb phrase):** Difficulty 0.808, Mean score 0.192. This was identification, but required grammatical understanding.
-   **English (Poem line):** Difficulty 0.742, Mean score 0.258. More open-ended, subjective.
-   **Social Science (Transparency):** Difficulty 0.653, Mean score 0.347. Required suggesting plausible ideas.

This algebra problem is procedural. It requires careful application of rules. Common errors would include sign errors (`-2b * 3b = -6b²` vs `+6b²`), incorrect multiplication of variables (`3a * 2a = 6a` vs `6a²`), or failure to distribute correctly. The rubric's allowance for unsimplified expansion makes it slightly less demanding in terms of the final step, but the core multiplication still requires precision.

The problem requires a good grasp of algebraic manipulation, which can be challenging for Grade 8 students if not practiced thoroughly. The cognitive load is moderate due to multiple multiplications and combining terms. The language demand is low as it's a direct mathematical instruction. The question is very clear. Prerequisite knowledge includes basic algebra, multiplication of integers, and exponents.

The rubric specificity is high because there's a very specific mathematical process and outcome expected. Any deviation in the expansion (even if the final answer is correct through a lucky error) might not get full marks if the working isn't shown or is incorrect. The examples in the rubric are very precise.

Given the procedural nature and potential for small errors, I anticipate it will be harder than the probability question (0.468) but easier than the English/Social Science questions which involve more interpretation or complex recall. The probability question was also a single correct answer. This algebra problem has multiple steps where errors can occur.

The calibration item for Math (Probability) had a classical difficulty of 0.468. This algebra problem is more complex procedurally.
The Social Science item about transparency had a difficulty of 0.653. While that was open-ended, it allowed for multiple valid answers. This algebra problem is more constrained.

I expect the difficulty to be higher than the probability problem because it involves more steps and more potential points of error. The "Shows correct expansion" part of the rubric is key. If a student simply writes the final answer `6a² + 5ab - 6b²` without showing the intermediate expansion `6a² + 9ab - 4ab - 6b²`, they might not get credit if the scorer strictly adheres to "Shows correct expansion". However, it's more likely that any correct step towards the expansion or the final correct answer would be awarded. Assuming a strict interpretation of "shows correct expansion", meaning the intermediate step shown in the example, many students might make errors or skip that explicit display.

Let's re-evaluate the rubric: "Shows correct expansion of the product, e.g., 3a(2a+3b) - 2b(2a+3b) or 6a² + 9ab - 4ab - 6b²." This phrasing implies that reaching the second example (the unsimplified sum of four terms) is sufficient for a score of 1. If students are expected to reach the simplified form, the rubric would likely say "Shows correct product" or "Finds the correct simplified product". This makes the item slightly less demanding than if simplification were strictly required.

However, even getting to `6a² + 9ab - 4ab - 6b²` requires 4 multiplication steps and correct handling of signs and exponents. This is a common stumbling block for Grade 8 students. I would place its difficulty somewhat higher than the probability question, but not as high as the English grammar identification or the complex Social Science analysis.

Item-total correlation: For procedural math problems, if well-designed and appropriate, we expect a decent correlation. The probability question had 0.576. This one is more involved, so it should also discriminate well among students who grasp algebra.

Final thought on difficulty: The probability question (0.468 difficulty) was fairly straightforward. This algebra problem has more steps and more opportunities for error (sign errors, exponent errors, distribution errors). Students who struggle with basic arithmetic or algebraic rules will likely score 0. I anticipate a higher proportion of students scoring 0 than for the probability question. The calibration items show that even seemingly simple identification tasks (English verb phrase) can have high difficulty (0.808). This is a multi-step calculation. I'd lean towards the difficulty being in the mid-range for math problems, perhaps around 0.55-0.65.

Mean score proportion: If difficulty is around 0.6, then mean score proportion would be around 0.4.

Item-total correlation: This problem directly tests a core algebraic skill. Students who are good at math are likely to get this, and those who struggle with foundational algebra will not. This should lead to a good item-total correlation, perhaps similar to or slightly higher than the probability question (0.576), as it's a more comprehensive test of algebraic understanding. I will estimate it to be slightly higher, reflecting its ability to differentiate students' algebraic proficiency.
