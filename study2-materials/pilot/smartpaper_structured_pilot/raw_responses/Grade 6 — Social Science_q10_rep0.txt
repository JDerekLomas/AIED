The target item asks students to name two important fairs or festivals in Rajasthan and describe one in a single sentence. The maximum score is 1, and the rubric states "For correctly naming any two distinct important fairs or festivals celebrated in Rajasthan." This is a crucial point: the description part of the question is *not* scored according to the provided rubric. This significantly lowers the difficulty compared to what the question text implies. I must base my analysis strictly on the provided rubric.

Let's break down the rubric: "For correctly naming any two distinct important fairs or festivals celebrated in Rajasthan."
This is a recall-based question. Students need to have learned about Rajasthan's culture and specific festivals/fairs.

Comparing to calibration examples:

1.  **Social Science (Grade 7) - Public vs Private Healthcare (Difficulty 0.881, Mean 0.119):** This required evaluation and arguments, which is much higher-order thinking than simple recall. The target item is much easier.

2.  **English (Grade 6) - Identify verb phrase (Difficulty 0.808, Mean 0.192):** This requires specific grammatical knowledge. The target item requires specific factual recall, which can be similarly difficult if the content hasn't been adequately covered or retained. However, naming *any two* offers some flexibility.

3.  **English (Grade 6) - Favorite line from poem (Difficulty 0.742, Mean 0.258):** This requires personal interpretation and justification. The target item is more straightforward recall.

4.  **Social Science (Grade 7) - Improve transparency in governance (Difficulty 0.653, Mean 0.347):** This requires suggesting plausible ways, implying some level of understanding and application, not just recall. The target item is simpler.

5.  **Mathematics (Grade 8) - Probability (Difficulty 0.468, Mean 0.532):** This is a calculation-based question with a clear right answer. The target item is recall.

**Analysis of the Target Item (based on the *actual* rubric):**

*   **Concept Complexity:** Low. It's about remembering facts.
*   **Procedural Steps:** Two steps: recall fair 1, recall fair 2.
*   **Abstraction Level:** Very low (concrete recall).
*   **Prerequisite Knowledge:** Students must have been taught about Rajasthan's culture, specifically fairs and festivals. This is core Social Science for Grade 6 in a region-specific context.
*   **Rubric Specificity:** Medium-high. While *any two* fairs/festivals are accepted, they must be correct and distinct. There isn't much room for partial credit if only one is named, given the max score of 1. If the intention was for 0.5 points per fair, the rubric should state it. As written, it implies both are needed for 1 point. This makes it harder than if partial credit was allowed.
*   **Common Error Likelihood:** Students might name only one, name an incorrect one, or name one not from Rajasthan. The description part of the question, if attempted, would be extra work but not impact the score.
*   **Question Clarity:** High. The question is very clear. However, the mismatch between the question asking for a description and the rubric *not* scoring it is a critical point. Assuming the rubric is the *definitive* scoring guide, the "describe" part of the question is effectively a distractor for the scoring. This might confuse students or lead them to spend time on unscored elements. For the purpose of psychometric analysis, I must assume the rubric dictates scoring. If the rubric *only* scores naming two, then the cognitive load and complexity are lower than the question *as written* suggests.
*   **Cognitive Load:** Low. Simple recall.
*   **Age Appropriateness:** High. Learning about local culture and history is appropriate for Grade 6 Social Science.
*   **Transfer Distance:** Low. This is likely direct recall from textbook content.
*   **Language Demand:** Low. Simple naming, not complex sentence construction required for the *scored* part.
*   **Response Precision:** Medium. Names must be correct, but there's a list of acceptable answers.

**Re-evaluating based on the rubric's implication of *only* naming two:**

The Max Score is 1. The rubric says "For correctly naming *any two* distinct important fairs or festivals celebrated in Rajasthan." This strongly implies that if a student names only one, they get 0. If they name two, they get 1. This is a binary scoring (0 or 1).

If the curriculum covers this well, and students are expected to know multiple such events, then naming two shouldn't be excessively difficult. Given it's Social Science Grade 6 and focused on local culture, this is typically a well-covered topic.

Let's consider the difficulty. The "Public vs Private Healthcare" (0.881) and "Identify verb phrase" (0.808) are quite high difficulty. These required either complex evaluation or specific grammatical knowledge. "Favorite line from poem" (0.742) required interpretation. "Improve transparency" (0.653) required suggestion/application. The Math problem (0.468) was the easiest.

Naming two facts should be easier than evaluation or complex grammar identification. It's probably harder than the Math problem, which had a clear calculation path. It's likely easier than the "Improve transparency" question, which required a bit more thought than pure recall.

The critical element is the *binary* scoring for *two* correct names. If a student knows only one, they score 0. This makes it harder than if partial credit was given (e.g., 0.5 for one correct).

Let's estimate where it falls. Students in Grade 6 might struggle with remembering *two* distinct facts, even if they know one. The "description" part of the question, although unscored, might add to cognitive load or confusion, potentially leading to lower scores if students focus on it and neglect to list two distinct names. However, if the teacher emphasizes "list two names," then it's straightforward. Assuming standard test-taking behavior, some students might miss the "two" or only know one.

I'd place it somewhere between "Improve transparency" (0.653) and "Favorite line" (0.742). It requires specific recall of two items. Many students might know one, but not two, or make a spelling error, or name a fair not from Rajasthan.

Let's consider the "Rubric Specificity" again. It's specific in requiring *two distinct* names. This is quite strict for a Max Score of 1.

**Difficulty Prediction:** I'm leaning towards it being moderately difficult. Not as hard as the verb phrase or healthcare items, but harder than the math problem. The "two distinct" requirement for a full point, with no partial credit, will push the difficulty up. A significant portion of students might only recall one or miss the "two" requirement. I'll estimate it to be around 0.70.

**Mean Score Proportion:** If difficulty is 0.70, then mean score proportion would be 0.30 (since 1 - 0.70 = 0.30 for a binary item).

**Item-Total Correlation:** This is a recall item. Recall items, if well-taught, can differentiate well between students who have studied and those who haven't. It's not a higher-order thinking skill, but it's not trivial either. The "Improve transparency" item had a correlation of 0.642, which was quite good. The "Favorite line" was 0.467. The "Verb phrase" was 0.386. I think this item, despite being recall, tests specific knowledge that should correlate reasonably well with overall Social Science achievement. It's not a trick question. I'd expect it to be in the moderate to high range for correlation, perhaps closer to the "Favorite line" or "Verb phrase" items, as it's a specific knowledge recall. It might be lower than the "Improve transparency" item which requires some application. Let's aim for a moderate correlation.
