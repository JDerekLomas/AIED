The student needs to differentiate between two types of historical sources: archaeological and literary. This implies defining each and providing an example for each. However, the rubric only awards points for defining *archaeological sources* and giving an example for *archaeological sources*. This is a critical mismatch between the question and the rubric. The question asks for differentiation and examples for *both*, but the rubric only scores one half of the differentiation. This will make the item appear much harder than it should be if students correctly answer the "literary" part but get no credit for it.

Let's re-read the rubric carefully: "For defining archaeological sources as physical remains/material evidence (e.g., objects, structures, ruins, inscriptions on stone) AND providing a correct example (e.g., pottery, coins, inscriptions, monuments, tools)."
This rubric is problematic. It only scores the archaeological part. If a student differentiates both and gives examples for both, they still only get 1 point if their archaeological part is correct. If they only define and give an example for literary sources, they get 0. This makes the item much harder due to scoring rather than inherent difficulty.

Assuming the rubric is applied strictly as written:
- **Concept Complexity**: The concepts of archaeological and literary sources are foundational in Grade 6 Social Science history. They are distinct concepts requiring basic definitions. Not overly complex. (5)
- **Procedural Steps**:
    1. Recall definition of archaeological sources.
    2. Recall example of archaeological sources.
    3. (Potentially, but not scored: Recall definition of literary sources.)
    4. (Potentially, but not scored: Recall example of literary sources.)
    The scored part only involves 2 steps.
- **Abstraction Level**: This is largely recall of definitions and examples taught directly in class. Low abstraction. (3)
- **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Basic understanding of what history is and how we learn about it. Specific definitions of these two source types. This is core Grade 6 Social Science content. (6)
- **Rubric Specificity**: The rubric is quite specific about what constitutes a correct definition for archaeological sources and provides clear examples. It's very specific in *what it scores*, which is only half of the question. (8 - specific about what it scores)
- **Common Error Likelihood**:
    * Students might confuse the two types.
    * Students might provide a definition but no example, or vice-versa.
    * Students might struggle with the "differentiate" part, perhaps just listing features without explicit comparison.
    * **CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE**: The rubric only scores archaeological. Students might correctly answer the literary part and get no credit, leading to a high proportion of zeros even for partially correct answers to the *question as posed*.
    * Students might struggle with providing a *correct* example.
    Given the rubric, many students might score 0 even if they partially understood the question or provided correct information for the un-scored part. (7 - high due to rubric mismatch)
- **Question Clarity**: The question itself is clear: "Differentiate between X and Y by giving one example for each." It asks for both. The issue is the rubric. (8 - question is clear)
- **Cognitive Load**: Recalling two definitions and two examples isn't excessively high. The differentiation aspect adds a slight layer, but it's not complex reasoning. (5)
- **Age Appropriateness**: This topic is standard for Grade 6 Social Science (History). (9)
- **Transfer Distance**: This is likely taught directly from the textbook or classroom instruction. Low transfer. (3)
- **Language Demand**: The terms "differentiate," "archaeological sources," and "literary sources" are standard academic vocabulary for this grade level in Social Science. Students need to be able to articulate definitions and examples clearly. (6)
- **Response Precision**: Students need to be precise in their definitions and examples for archaeological sources. The rubric is quite specific on acceptable examples. (7)

Now, let's consider the impact of the rubric mismatch on the psychometric parameters. The question asks for two distinct parts: archaeological and literary sources, with examples for each. The rubric, however, only scores the archaeological part. This means:
1. A student who correctly defines and exemplifies *only* literary sources will score 0.
2. A student who correctly defines and exemplifies *both* will score 1 (if the archaeological part is correct).
3. A student who correctly defines and exemplifies *only* archaeological sources will score 1.

This significantly inflates the "difficulty" (proportion scoring 0) because students are not getting credit for half of what the question asks. It also lowers the mean score proportion. The item-total correlation might be affected; if stronger students tend to answer both parts, and only one part is scored, it might still correlate, but perhaps less strongly than if the full answer was scored.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The Social Science G7 item "Evaluate key differences public/private healthcare" (difficulty 0.881, mean 0.119) is conceptually more demanding (evaluation, argument) and requires more nuanced understanding. This target item is more recall.
- The English G6 "Identify verb phrase" (difficulty 0.808, mean 0.192) is a very specific recall/identification. This target item is slightly more complex due to definition + example.
- The English G6 "Which line from the poem..." (difficulty 0.742, mean 0.258) involves personal opinion and justification, which can be easier or harder depending on articulation.
- The Social Science G7 "Improve transparency in governance" (difficulty 0.653, mean 0.347) asks for a suggestion, which is a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall/differentiation.
- The Math G8 probability (difficulty 0.468, mean 0.532) is a direct calculation, often easier for students who grasp the concept.

Given the rubric's limitation, I expect a very high classical difficulty. Many students will struggle to provide *both* a correct definition *and* a correct example for archaeological sources specifically, and even if they provide *only* the literary part correctly, they get 0. This will push the proportion scoring 0 upwards significantly, similar to the G7 healthcare item which had a very low mean score.

The question itself, if scored fully, would probably be moderately difficult (e.g., 0.5-0.6 difficulty). But the rubric restricts scoring to only one part of a two-part differentiation, making it much harder to achieve the single point.

I'd estimate the classical difficulty to be high, perhaps in the 0.75-0.85 range, because of the strict scoring of only one half of the requested differentiation. This would mean a mean score proportion in the 0.15-0.25 range.
Item-total correlation: If students who know the topic generally know both archaeological and literary sources, then even scoring only one part should still show a reasonable correlation with overall ability, but perhaps slightly attenuated because some good students might miss the specific archaeological part or focus on the unscored literary part. I'd expect it to be moderate, perhaps 0.45-0.55, lower than the very high 0.642 of the "governance" item which was a more direct measure of understanding.

Let's refine:
- **Difficulty**: The "public/private healthcare" item had 0.881 difficulty for a more complex task. The "verb phrase" was 0.808 for a very specific identification. This item, with its restrictive rubric, feels closer to the "verb phrase" in terms of specificity needed for the *scored part*, but the question *asks for more*. If students struggle with *both* definition and example for archaeological, or if they correctly answer the literary part and get no credit, the difficulty will be very high. I'll lean towards the higher end, similar to the verb phrase or slightly lower than the healthcare one.
- **Mean Score Proportion**: Will directly reflect the difficulty.
- **Item-Total Correlation**: The concepts are fundamental, so stronger students are more likely to get it right. It should be a decent differentiator. I'll place it moderately high.

Final consideration: The question says "differentiate... by giving one example for each." The rubric says "For defining archaeological sources... AND providing a correct example..." This still implies that only the archaeological part is scored. If the question was "Define archaeological sources and give an example," it would be easier to score 1. The "differentiate" part adds a cognitive burden without being explicitly scored. This further increases the effective difficulty.
