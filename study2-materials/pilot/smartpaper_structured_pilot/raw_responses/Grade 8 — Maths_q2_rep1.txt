The student needs to apply the distributive property (or FOIL method) twice. First, they need to understand that "product of binomials" means multiplication. Then, they need to distribute each term from the first binomial to each term in the second binomial. This involves multiplication of terms with variables and coefficients, and then combining like terms.

Concepts involved:
1. Understanding "product" and "binomials".
2. Distributive property (or FOIL).
3. Multiplication of algebraic terms (coefficients and variables).
4. Combining like terms.

Procedural steps:
1. Set up the multiplication: (3a - 2b)(2a + 3b)
2. Distribute the first term of the first binomial: 3a * 2a and 3a * 3b
3. Distribute the second term of the first binomial: -2b * 2a and -2b * 3b
4. Perform the multiplications: 6a², 9ab, -4ab, -6b²
5. Combine like terms: 9ab - 4ab = 5ab
6. Write the final expression: 6a² + 5ab - 6b²

The rubric specifies "shows correct expansion... or 6a² + 9ab - 4ab - 6b²." This implies that showing the intermediate expansion steps is sufficient for full credit, even if the final simplification is not explicitly mentioned as required by the rubric for the 1 mark. However, standard teaching would usually expect the full simplification. If the rubric only awards for the expansion, it's slightly less demanding than expecting the final simplified answer. Given the example in the rubric, "6a² + 9ab - 4ab - 6b²" is a valid stopping point for full credit. This makes the item slightly easier than if the fully simplified form was strictly required.

Prerequisite knowledge:
- Understanding variables and coefficients.
- Basic multiplication.
- Distributive property.
- Combining like terms.

Common errors:
- Sign errors (especially with -2b).
- Forgetting to multiply coefficients or variables correctly.
- Incorrectly combining like terms (e.g., trying to combine 6a² with 9ab).
- Not distributing all terms (e.g., only multiplying first terms and last terms).
- Basic arithmetic errors.

Comparing to calibration items:
- Maths Grade 8 probability item: This item is about applying a formula and understanding basic probability. It has a classical difficulty of 0.468, meaning it's moderately easy. The current algebra item involves more steps and potential for errors.
- Social Science Grade 7 (transparency): Difficulty 0.653. This is conceptual and requires critical thinking.
- English Grade 6 (verb phrase): Difficulty 0.808. This is a specific grammar identification task.
- Social Science Grade 7 (healthcare): Difficulty 0.881. This is an analytical task requiring specific knowledge and comparison.

The algebra problem requires a sequence of precise procedural steps. It's not a recall task, but an application of learned procedures. It's more complex than identifying a verb phrase or a simple probability calculation. The potential for errors (especially sign errors or incomplete distribution) is high. The rubric is specific about the *expansion* rather than necessarily the final simplified form for full credit, which makes it slightly less demanding than a full algebraic simplification. However, the mental manipulation of terms with variables and signs is still quite demanding for Grade 8.

The item-total correlation for the Math probability question is 0.576, which is good. The current item, being more procedural and requiring careful execution, should also have a decent correlation, as students who are generally good at math will be able to follow the steps.

Given the multi-step nature and potential for errors, I expect this to be harder than the probability question (0.468 difficulty). It's likely to be in the range of the more difficult social science and English items, but perhaps not as high as the most difficult ones which require more open-ended conceptual generation. The rubric's allowance for the expanded form (before full simplification) might make it slightly easier than if the full simplified answer was the only acceptable response.

Let's consider the steps again.
(3a – 2b)(2a + 3b)
= 3a(2a) + 3a(3b) - 2b(2a) - 2b(3b)  (This is the "expansion" part the rubric points to)
= 6a² + 9ab - 4ab - 6b²
= 6a² + 5ab - 6b²

If the rubric accepts `6a² + 9ab - 4ab - 6b²` for full marks, it reduces the complexity slightly as combining like terms is often a source of error. However, the core distribution and multiplication is still there.

The language demand is low, just understanding "product of binomials."
Response precision is high, as the algebraic expression must be exact.
Age appropriateness should be good for Grade 8 algebra.
Cognitive load is moderate due to multiple terms and signs to track.
Transfer distance is low; this is a standard textbook problem type.
Rubric specificity is high as it gives examples of acceptable answers.

I anticipate a higher difficulty than the probability question (0.468) but lower than the Social Science healthcare question (0.881) or English verb phrase (0.808) because while procedural, it's a core math skill that students practice. Many students will attempt and get some parts correct, but full credit might be challenging due to sign errors or combining like terms. If the rubric allows for the unsimplified expanded form, this slightly lowers the difficulty.

Let's re-evaluate the difficulty based on the rubric accepting the expanded form. The *critical* part is the correct application of the distributive property and multiplication of terms. Combining like terms is the final step. If that step isn't strictly necessary for full marks, it makes it a bit easier.

Compared to the Social Science 'transparency' question (difficulty 0.653), which requires generating ideas, this math problem requires applying a specific algorithm. It is likely to be harder than the probability question (0.468) due to more steps and potential for errors, but possibly easier than the 'transparency' question if students have practiced this algorithm extensively. However, algebraic manipulation often trips students up.

I'll lean towards it being on the harder side for a 1-mark item, given the multiple opportunities for small errors that lead to a score of 0.
The item-total correlation should be good because it tests a fundamental skill where stronger students will consistently perform better.
