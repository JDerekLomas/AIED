The target item is a standard algebraic equation solving problem for Grade 7.

**Concept Complexity**: It involves the core concept of solving linear equations, which requires understanding variables, constants, and maintaining equality through inverse operations. This is a foundational concept for Grade 7 algebra. I'd rate it moderately complex, as it's not just a single concept recall but an application of principles.

**Procedural Steps**:
1. Subtract 2 from both sides: `4x = 10 - 2` -> `4x = 8`
2. Divide both sides by 4: `x = 8 / 4` -> `x = 2`
There are two distinct algebraic steps.

**Abstraction Level**: It's not pure recall, but applying a learned procedure to a specific instance. It's a structured problem, so not highly abstract reasoning, but requires understanding the "why" behind the steps. Mid-range.

**Prerequisite Knowledge**: Students need to understand basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and the concept of a variable and an equation. This is generally covered in prior grades or early Grade 7.

**Rubric Specificity**: The rubric is very specific: "Correctly isolates the variable 'x' through proper algebraic steps (subtracting 2, then dividing by 4) to find the solution `x = 2`." This means partial credit is unlikely for incorrect steps leading to an incorrect answer, or for getting the correct answer by chance without showing steps (though the prompt doesn't explicitly demand steps, good practice implies it). The final answer `x=2` is precise.

**Common Error Likelihood**: High.
*   Arithmetic errors (e.g., 10-2=7, or 8/4=3).
*   Operation errors (e.g., adding 2 instead of subtracting, multiplying by 4 instead of dividing).
*   Transposition errors (e.g., `4x = 10 + 2`).
*   Leaving `4x = 8` as the answer.
*   Not understanding how to isolate `x` when it has a coefficient.

**Question Clarity**: The question "Solve the following equation for x" is extremely clear and unambiguous.

**Cognitive Load**: For a Grade 7 student, performing two sequential algebraic operations, while keeping track of the equality principle, requires moderate working memory. It's not trivial, but also not exceptionally high for a practiced skill.

**Age Appropriateness**: This is a core topic in Grade 7 mathematics curriculum in India. It's perfectly appropriate.

**Transfer Distance**: This is a very standard type of problem directly from the textbook or classroom instruction. There's minimal transfer required.

**Language Demand**: Minimal. The question uses simple, direct language. The answer is numerical.

**Response Precision**: The answer must be precisely `x = 2`. Any other numerical answer is incorrect.

**Calibration against examples**:
*   **Math (Prob)**: Difficulty 0.468, Mean Prop 0.532. This was a direct application of a formula/concept. My target item is also a direct application, but involves procedural steps that can lead to more errors than a probability calculation.
*   **Social Science (Governance)**: Difficulty 0.653, Mean Prop 0.347. This was more open-ended, requiring reasoning. My item is more structured.
*   **English (Verb phrase)**: Difficulty 0.808, Mean Prop 0.192. This was very specific identification, but perhaps the concept itself was difficult or easily confused.
*   **Social Science (Healthcare)**: Difficulty 0.881, Mean Prop 0.119. This required analytical comparison and examples, which is a higher-order skill.

My item is procedural and direct. The common errors are likely to be arithmetic or simple operational mistakes, rather than conceptual misunderstandings of the core algebraic principle for many students. For those who grasp the concept, it's straightforward. For those who don't, it's impossible. This suggests a difficulty somewhere between the Math probability question (which is often easier once the concept is clear) and the English verb phrase (where specific terminology might trip students). I anticipate it will be harder than the probability question due to the multi-step nature and potential for arithmetic errors.

Considering the prevalence of basic arithmetic errors and common algebraic misconceptions (like `4x` meaning `4+x` or dividing by 2 instead of 4, or adding 2 instead of subtracting), the classical difficulty might be higher than the probability problem. However, it's a very standard problem, so well-taught students should find it easy. I'll lean towards it being slightly harder than the probability problem, but not as hard as the English grammar identification.

The item-total correlation should be good, as it tests a fundamental skill. Students who understand basic algebra will likely get this right and also perform well on other math items. Students who struggle with math will likely get this wrong.
