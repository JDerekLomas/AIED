The target item is a basic linear equation in one variable, suitable for Grade 7 Mathematics.

Let's break down the cognitive demands:
1.  **Understanding the goal:** The student needs to understand "Solve for x" means finding the value of x that makes the equation true.
2.  **Order of operations (reverse):** To isolate x, they need to perform inverse operations in the correct order. This means subtracting 2 from both sides first, then dividing by 4.
3.  **Basic arithmetic:** Performing subtraction (10-2=8) and division (8/4=2).
4.  **Maintaining equality:** The fundamental principle of performing the same operation on both sides of the equation.

Comparing this to calibration items:
*   **Mathematics (Grade 8) Probability (0.468 difficulty):** This item involves understanding fractions and probability concepts. It's conceptually distinct but also requires specific procedural steps. The target item is arguably more foundational for algebra.
*   **English (Grade 6) Verb Phrase (0.808 difficulty):** This is a linguistic identification task, which can be tricky if the concept isn't firmly grasped. The difficulty is high, suggesting even seemingly simple identification tasks can be hard for this demographic.
*   **Social Science (Grade 7) Healthcare (0.881 difficulty):** This is a complex analytical task requiring generation of arguments, which is very difficult.
*   **Social Science (Grade 7) Governance (0.653 difficulty):** This requires suggesting plausible solutions, which is also higher-order thinking but less complex than the healthcare evaluation.
*   **English (Grade 6) Poem (0.742 difficulty):** This is subjective interpretation and explanation, which can be challenging due to language demands and the need for personal reflection.

The target item is a very standard algebraic problem. Grade 7 is typically when linear equations are introduced and practiced extensively.

**Concept Complexity:** It involves the concept of an unknown variable, equations, and inverse operations. It's not overly complex, but it's more than simple recall. (Rating: 4-5)

**Procedural Steps:**
1.  Subtract 2 from both sides.
2.  Divide by 4 from both sides.
3.  State the answer.
This is 2-3 distinct steps. (Rating: 4)

**Abstraction Level:** It's more abstract than direct computation but less abstract than proving a theorem or analyzing a social issue. It requires applying learned rules to a specific problem. (Rating: 5)

**Prerequisite Knowledge:** Students need to know basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and the concept of equality in equations. This should be covered by Grade 7. (Rating: 5)

**Rubric Specificity:** The answer is exact: x=2. There's no room for partial credit unless the rubric explicitly allows for correct steps with arithmetic errors, but the current rubric implies a correct final answer from correct steps. (Rating: 9 - very specific answer)

**Common Error Likelihood:** High. Students might:
*   Perform operations in the wrong order (e.g., divide by 4 first).
*   Make arithmetic errors (10-2=7, 8/4=3, etc.).
*   Apply the operation only to one side (e.g., 4x = 10-2, but forget to subtract 2 from the left side of the equation conceptually, even if they write it on the right).
*   Forget to divide by 4.
*   Misunderstand the '4x' as '4+x'.
These are very common errors in early algebra. (Rating: 7-8)

**Question Clarity:** The question "Solve the following equation for x" is extremely clear and unambiguous for a math context. (Rating: 10)

**Cognitive Load:** Moderate. Holding the equation, performing inverse operations, and keeping track of both sides requires some working memory but is not excessive for a Grade 7 student. (Rating: 5)

**Age Appropriateness:** Perfectly appropriate for Grade 7 curriculum. This is a core skill taught at this level. (Rating: 10)

**Transfer Distance:** Very low. This is a direct application of a standard type of problem found in textbooks and taught in class. (Rating: 2)

**Language Demand:** Minimal. Understanding "Solve for x" and basic number/operator symbols. (Rating: 2)

**Response Precision:** The answer must be precisely x=2. No alternative phrasing or approximation is acceptable. (Rating: 10)

**Predictions based on calibration:**
*   **Probability (Grade 8, 0.468 difficulty):** This item has a relatively low difficulty for a math problem. It suggests that if the concept is clear and procedural steps are limited, students can perform well.
*   The English verb phrase (0.808) and Social Science items (0.881, 0.653) are significantly harder, indicating that complex analysis, open-ended explanations, or even nuanced identification can be very challenging.

The algebra problem is procedural and has a single correct answer. While common errors exist, it's a fundamental skill. Given that it's a direct application problem and a core part of the Grade 7 curriculum, I would expect it to be less difficult than the English identification tasks or the social science analytical questions. It's probably more on par with, or slightly harder than, the Grade 8 probability question, primarily due to the multi-step nature and common algebraic errors.

Let's consider typical performance in Indian government schools. While this is a core concept, mastery often varies. The procedural steps are clear, but errors in arithmetic or sequence are common.

Compared to the Grade 8 probability (difficulty 0.468), which involves understanding fractions and probability rules, this algebra problem requires slightly more sequential steps and has distinct error patterns. However, it's also a very heavily practiced type of problem.

I anticipate the difficulty to be higher than the probability problem, perhaps in the 0.55-0.65 range. The mean score proportion would then be 0.35-0.45.
Item-total correlation: Since it tests a fundamental skill with clear correct/incorrect answers, it should differentiate well between students who grasp algebra and those who don't. I'd expect a good correlation, similar to the probability item (0.576) or even the Social Science governance item (0.642).

Final checks:
*   Concept complexity: 4 (linear equation, inverse operations)
*   Procedural steps: 4 (subtract, then divide)
*   Abstraction level: 5 (applying rules, not pure recall)
*   Prerequisite knowledge: 5 (basic arithmetic, understanding variables)
*   Rubric specificity: 9 (exact answer needed)
*   Common error likelihood: 7 (arithmetic errors, order of operations, incomplete solution)
*   Question clarity: 10 (very clear)
*   Cognitive load: 5 (moderate working memory for 2 steps)
*   Age appropriateness: 10 (perfect fit for G7)
*   Transfer distance: 2 (direct application)
*   Language demand: 2 (minimal)
*   Response precision: 10 (exact numerical answer)

Given the combination of clear question, specific answer, but common procedural errors, the difficulty should be moderate. It's harder than the Grade 8 probability question because it involves more steps and potential pitfalls (like order of operations, or forgetting a step). I'll place it slightly harder than the probability question, but easier than the English identification task.

Classical difficulty (prop scoring 0): I'd expect a significant portion of students to make errors. Perhaps around 55-60%.
Mean score proportion: 0.40-0.45
Item-total correlation: Good differentiation, so 0.55-0.60.
