The student needs to differentiate between two concepts: archaeological sources and literary sources. This means they need to understand the core definition of each. The question also requires providing one example for *each* type of source. The rubric, however, only scores for archaeological sources: "For defining archaeological sources as physical remains/material evidence... AND providing a correct example". This is a critical discrepancy between the question and the rubric. The question explicitly asks for differentiation and examples for *both*, but the rubric only awards points for *one* of the two categories. This will significantly impact the interpretation of difficulty and scoring.

Let's re-evaluate based on the rubric. The rubric, as stated, only awards a score if the student correctly defines *archaeological sources* and provides an example for *archaeological sources*. It completely ignores the "literary sources" part of the question. This makes the item effectively easier than the question initially suggests, as students only need to recall and articulate information about one type of source, not differentiate between two. However, students will likely attempt to answer both parts of the question, potentially wasting effort if they don't know the rubric. For the purpose of psychometric analysis, I must assume the rubric is applied as stated.

Therefore, the task is:
1. Define archaeological sources (physical remains/material evidence).
2. Provide an example of an archaeological source.

This is a direct recall question. "Early Civilizations" is a common topic in Grade 6 Social Science in India, where these source types are introduced.

**Concept Complexity:** Two concepts are mentioned in the question (archaeological, literary), but only one is scored by the rubric. The concept of "archaeological sources" itself isn't highly complex, involving understanding that history can be learned from physical objects.
**Procedural Steps:** 1. Recall definition of archaeological sources. 2. Recall an example of an archaeological source. (If the rubric had covered both, it would be 4 steps).
**Abstraction Level:** This is primarily recall of definitions and examples, which is a low level of abstraction.
**Prerequisite Knowledge:** Basic understanding of what "history" is and how we learn about it. Specific knowledge of the definitions of these two types of sources is required, which is standard for Grade 6 Social Science.
**Rubric Specificity:** The rubric is quite specific: "physical remains/material evidence" for the definition and "pottery, coins, inscriptions, monuments, tools" for examples. It doesn't allow for much deviation in the core concept.
**Common Error Likelihood:**
    * Students might confuse archaeological and literary sources if they don't fully grasp the distinction (though the rubric mitigates this by only scoring one).
    * Providing a definition that is too vague.
    * Providing an incorrect example.
    * Focusing too much on literary sources, which won't be scored.
    * The instruction to "differentiate" might lead students to write more than necessary for the scored part.
**Question Clarity:** The question is clear in what it asks, but the discrepancy with the rubric makes it potentially misleading regarding what will be scored. Assuming students are unaware of the rubric, they will attempt to differentiate both. If they are aware of the rubric, the question is effectively simpler. I will rate based on the *student's perception of the question*, assuming they will try to answer both parts. This adds to cognitive load and potential for error in allocation of effort.
**Cognitive Load:** Recalling two definitions and two examples, then structuring a differentiation, would involve moderate cognitive load. Given the rubric only scores one part, the *effective* cognitive load for getting a score is lower, but the *perceived* cognitive load from the question is higher. I will average this out.
**Age Appropriateness:** This is a fundamental concept in Grade 6 Social Science. It is highly appropriate.
**Transfer Distance:** This is likely taught directly from textbooks. Low transfer distance.
**Language Demand:** The language is straightforward. Students need to be able to articulate a definition and list an example.
**Response Precision:** The definition needs to be accurate to the core concept, and the example needs to be valid. Not necessarily exact wording, but precise meaning.

**Comparison with Calibration Examples:**

*   **Social Science (Grade 7) - Public/Private Healthcare (Difficulty 0.881, MSP 0.119):** This required evaluation and argument, higher-order thinking. My target item is recall, and the effective scored part is simpler. So, my item should be easier.
*   **English (Grade 6) - Verb Phrase (Difficulty 0.808, MSP 0.192):** Identifying a specific grammatical element. My item requires recalling definitions and examples. Similar level of direct knowledge recall, but my item requires generating text rather than just identifying.
*   **English (Grade 6) - Favorite Line (Difficulty 0.742, MSP 0.258):** This involved personal opinion and justification, which can be easier for some students as it's less about strict recall. My item is pure recall.
*   **Social Science (Grade 7) - Improve Transparency (Difficulty 0.653, MSP 0.347):** This required suggesting ways, implying some level of application or critical thinking, even if simple. My item is more direct recall. This item has a high item-total correlation (0.642), suggesting it differentiates well among students who understand governance.
*   **Mathematics (Grade 8) - Probability (Difficulty 0.468, MSP 0.532):** This is a direct application of a formula/concept, often well-practiced. It's the easiest calibration item. My item is recall of definitions.

The discrepancy between the question and the rubric is crucial. If students *only* need to define and exemplify archaeological sources, it's a relatively straightforward recall task. If they try to differentiate *both* and provide examples for *both*, it's a slightly more complex task, but only the archaeological part contributes to the score.

Given the rubric only scores the archaeological part, the effective task is simpler than what the question *asks*. This might lead to a higher mean score proportion than if both parts were scored. However, the fact that students might *try* to answer the full question means there's a higher chance of partial answers or errors in the unscored part that don't affect the score, but might indicate confusion.

Let's assume the rubric is strictly followed.
The task: Define archaeological sources AND give an example.
This is a core concept taught in Grade 6 Social Science. Students are expected to know this.
The difficulty would likely be moderate. It's not as simple as identifying a verb phrase, but not as complex as evaluating healthcare.
Compared to "Identify the verb phrase" (Difficulty 0.808), this is conceptually a bit more involved as it requires generating a definition and an example, not just identifying.
Compared to "Suggest ways to improve transparency" (Difficulty 0.653), this is more direct recall, less inferential.

The item-total correlation: If students understand the basic concepts of history sources, they should get this right. It should correlate reasonably well with overall Social Science knowledge. The clarity of the rubric (even if it only scores one part) means scoring should be consistent, which helps correlation.

Let's consider the difficulty. If the question asked *only* for archaeological sources, it would be easier. Since it asks for differentiation but only scores one side, some students might get confused, or misallocate effort. However, if they *do* know archaeological sources, they will get the point. This isn't a particularly tricky concept for the grade level.

I'll lean towards it being moderately difficult, perhaps similar to the English verb phrase or slightly easier due to the direct recall nature within Social Science, which often relies on memorization of such facts. The fact that only *one* part of the differentiation is scored makes it significantly easier than if both were required.

Let's consider the "Public/Private Healthcare" item (0.881 difficulty, 0.119 MSP). That required analysis and argument. My target is recall. So, my item should be *much* easier.
"Verb Phrase" (0.808 difficulty, 0.192 MSP). My item requires generation, not just identification. Slightly harder?
"Favorite Line" (0.742 difficulty, 0.258 MSP). Personal response. My item is factual. Could be harder than this.
"Transparency" (0.653 difficulty, 0.347 MSP). Suggesting ways. My item is recall. Might be similar or slightly easier.
"Probability" (0.468 difficulty, 0.532 MSP). Math problem, often practiced. Easiest.

My item is recall-based from Social Science. The core concept is fundamental. The rubric simplifies the task.
I expect the difficulty to be higher than the math problem, but lower than the analytical Social Science question.
Perhaps closer to the "Transparency" question in terms of difficulty, or slightly easier due to the direct recall.
The wording of the rubric "For defining archaeological sources as physical remains/material evidence AND providing a correct example" implies both parts must be correct to get the 1 point. This makes it a bit stricter.

Let's reconsider the "common error likelihood" and "cognitive load" due to the question-rubric mismatch. Students will read "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources... by giving one example for each." This requires understanding both, comparing them, and then giving two examples. This mental process is more demanding than just recalling one definition and one example. Even if the rubric ignores half their effort, the cognitive load *during the attempt* is higher. This might lead to more students failing to meet the *scored* criteria because they spread their mental resources too thin, or get confused by the comparison aspect.

If a student only defines archaeological sources and gives an example, they score 1. If they define both, give both examples, and differentiate correctly, they also score 1. If they only define literary sources and give an example, they score 0. This asymmetry is problematic.

I'll assume students will attempt the full question.
The core concepts (archaeological sources, literary sources) are typically taught together.
The definition for archaeological sources is quite specific in the rubric.
Difficulty: I think it will be harder than the "transparency" question (0.653) because of the two-part nature of the question, even if only one is scored. Students might stumble on *either* the definition *or* the example, or get confused by the differentiation. It's not as simple as identifying a verb phrase. I'd place it closer to the English verb phrase question or slightly harder.

Let's go with a difficulty somewhat higher than "transparency" but lower than "public/private healthcare".
A difficulty in the range of 0.70-0.75 seems reasonable.
Item-total correlation: Since it tests a fundamental concept and the rubric is specific for the scored part, it should correlate well with overall Social Science understanding. I'd expect it to be decent, perhaps in the 0.45-0.55 range.

Recalibrating for the rubric's partial scoring:
If the rubric *only* scores for archaeological sources, then students who know only that part will get the score. Students who know *both* will also get the score. Students who confuse them or only know literary sources will get 0. This might make the item *effectively* easier for students who only remember half the required information from the question.

However, the "differentiate" instruction implies a comparison, which can be harder than just defining.

Let's assume the standard teaching approach: archaeological and literary sources are introduced together, and their differences are highlighted. So, students are likely to know both if they've studied the topic. The question is a direct test of this knowledge.

Given the rubric is for "defining archaeological sources... AND providing a correct example", this is a two-part requirement for the single point. A student must get *both* right for the score. This makes it stricter.

Final thought process on difficulty:
It's a Grade 6 Social Science concept, usually taught explicitly.
It requires recalling a specific definition and a specific example.
The "differentiate" part of the question adds a layer of complexity for the student, even if the rubric doesn't score the "literary" part. Students might waste time on the unscored part, or fail to focus enough on the archaeological part.
The two conditions in the rubric ("defining AND providing example") for 1 point make it a bit stringent.
I'll compare it to the "Verb Phrase" (0.808 difficulty, 0.192 MSP). That's direct identification. This is direct recall and generation.
I'll compare it to "Transparency" (0.653 difficulty, 0.347 MSP). That requires suggesting, which is a bit higher-order than pure recall, but often students have memorized such suggestions.

I think the difficulty will be higher than "Transparency" because it's a specific factual recall with two conditions for the point (definition + example), and the question's wording might lead to confusion/misallocation of effort. But it won't be as hard as the analytical healthcare question.

Let's estimate around 0.75-0.80 difficulty. This suggests a significant proportion of students will score 0. This is plausible for a Grade 6 recall question that requires precision in both definition and example.

Item-total correlation: The item tests a fundamental concept. If students understand the basics of history, they should perform well. If they struggle with basic concepts, they will likely struggle here. The rubric is clear for the scored part, ensuring consistent scoring. I expect a good correlation, perhaps similar to "Verb Phrase" (0.386) or "Favorite Line" (0.467), possibly higher due to its foundational nature. I'll aim for 0.45-0.50.
