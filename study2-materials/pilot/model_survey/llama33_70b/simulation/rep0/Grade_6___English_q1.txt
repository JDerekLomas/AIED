To estimate the proportion correct, I'll break down the expected performance for each group:

* High-performing (5 students): 4-5 students are likely to get full marks, as they consistently score high.
* Above average (10 students): 6-7 students might get full marks, as they generally understand the material but might made minor errors.
* Average (10 students): 2-3 students could get full marks, as they have a basic understanding but may struggle with simpler questions.
* Struggling (5 students): 0-1 students might get full marks, as they often struggle with even basic concepts.

Assuming the higher end of these estimates, let's calculate the total number of students who would score full marks: 
5 (high-performing) + 7 (above average) + 3 (average) + 0 (struggling) = 15

The estimated proportion correct would then be: 15/30 = 0.5 or 50%

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 0.5
