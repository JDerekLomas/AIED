To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks on this question, we need to consider the abilities of each group.

- High-performing students (~5): Since they consistently score 80%+, it's reasonable to expect that most (if not all) of them would choose the correct word "some" in the given sentence, so let's assume all 5 get it correct.
- Above average students (~10): These students score between 60-80%, indicating a good command of the language but with some room for improvement. Assuming about 70-80% of them would get this question correct due to its comparative simplicity, we'd estimate around 7-8 students getting full marks.
- Average students (~10): With scores between 40-60%, they have a more mixed understanding. For a relatively straightforward question like this, perhaps around 40-50% of them might choose "some" correctly, which translates to about 4-5 students getting it right.
- Struggling students (~5): Scoring below 40%, these students face more challenges with the language. It's plausible that about 1-2 might get the answer correct despite their difficulties.

Given these estimates:
- All 5 high-performing students get it correct.
