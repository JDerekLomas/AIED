To estimate the difficulty of this question and the proportion of Grade 6 students in Indian government schools who would score full marks, let's break down the components that could influence the ease or hardness of this question.

1. **Knowledge of 'some' vs. 'any':** This question requires a basic understanding of the difference between "some" and "any." "Some" is used for affirmative sentences regarding the existence of something, whereas "any" is often used in negative sentences or questions.

   - Lack of understanding of the difference between "some" and "any."
   - Confusing the use of "some" in positive statements with "any" in negative statements or questions.

3. **Procedural Errors:**
   - Overthinking and second-guessing due to the similarity between "some" and "any" in casual speech.
   - Inadequate practice with grammatical structures, leading to a lapse in distinguishing the right word in different contexts.
