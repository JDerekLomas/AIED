ELEMENTS:
1. **Vocabulary:** "Where," "did," "she," "find," "old," "book," "attic" – understanding the meaning of each word.
2. **Pronoun Reference:** Understanding "she" refers to Riya (assuming prior context establishes this – a crucial element!).
3. **Sentence Structure:** Parsing a Wh-question ("Where…?") requiring understanding of question formation.
4. **Information Recall:** Remembering *where* Riya found the book – this requires holding the story/text in working memory. (This is the core task).
5. **Target Information Identification:** Identifying "attic" as the relevant detail from the remembered text.
6. **Acceptable Answer Formats:** Understanding the rubric allows for variations ('in the attic', 'attic'). This adds a slight meta-cognitive load.
