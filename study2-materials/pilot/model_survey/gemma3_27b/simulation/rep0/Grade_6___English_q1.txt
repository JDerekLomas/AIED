Here's a breakdown of estimated scores, considering the student abilities and the simplicity of the question, and then the overall proportion:

* **High-Performing (5 students):** This question is very straightforward. I'd expect all 5 to get it right. (5/5 correct)
* **Above Average (10 students):** These students should also mostly get it right. Perhaps one might misread or have a momentary lapse. So, 9/10 correct.
* **Average (10 students):** This is where it gets trickier. They understand reading comprehension, but might struggle with precise recall. I'd estimate about half get it right. 5/10 correct.
* **Struggling (5 students):** These students will likely struggle with comprehension and recall. Maybe one student remembers the key detail. 1/5 correct.

**Total Correct:** 5 + 9 + 5 + 1 = 20

**Proportion Correct:** 20 / 30 = 2/3 ≈ 0.67

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 0.67 (or 67%)**
