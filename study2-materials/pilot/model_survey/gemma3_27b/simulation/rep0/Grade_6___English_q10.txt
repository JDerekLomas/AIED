Here's a breakdown of estimated scores for each ability group and the overall proportion:

* **High-Performing (5 students):** This question is very basic grammar. All 5 would likely get it correct. (5/5 correct)
* **Above Average (10 students):** These students have a good grasp of English fundamentals.  Around 8-9 would likely get it right. (8-9/10 correct)
* **Average (10 students):** This is a bit of a grey area for average students. They might know the rule, but could easily make a mistake. Let's estimate 5-6 get it correct. (5-6/10 correct)
* **Struggling (5 students):** These students will likely struggle with this concept. Perhaps 1-2 might guess correctly. (1-2/5 correct)

**Total Correct:**

* Lower estimate: 5 + 8 + 5 + 1 = 19
* Higher estimate: 5 + 9 + 6 + 2 = 22

**Proportion of Students Scoring Full Marks:**

* Lower estimate: 19/30 = 0.6
