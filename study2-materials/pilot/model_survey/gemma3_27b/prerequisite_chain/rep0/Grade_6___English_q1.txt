PREREQUISITES:
1. **Reading Comprehension of a Short Passage:** The student *must* have read and understood a preceding passage that contains the information about where the book was found. This isn't just decoding words, but understanding the *meaning* of the sentences.
2. **Vocabulary Knowledge: "Attic"**: Understanding the meaning of the word "attic". Many students will not have encountered this word before, especially those from Hindi-medium backgrounds. Even if they *recognize* the word, they may not understand it refers to a specific place.
3. **Pronoun Recognition: "She"**: Understanding that "she" refers to a specific person mentioned in the passage (likely a name like Riya). This requires tracking references.
4. **Question Word Understanding: "Where"**: Knowing that "where" asks about a *location*.
5. **Information Retrieval:** The ability to locate specific information *within* the passage, rather than just generally understanding it. This is a key reading skill.
6. **Sentence Construction (Simple Answer):** The ability to formulate a short, grammatically acceptable answer (even if basic – “attic” is sufficient). This isn’t about perfect grammar,
