Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about the item difficulty of finding where "she" found the old book. So, part of the task is evaluating how this question relates to English learning for a typical 6th-grade group in Indian government schools.

First, I need to grasp how item difficulty in reading comprehension assessments works, especially for this age group. Grade 6 readers must read, understand details, remember story content, and respond with correct answers. For a question about where something was found, comprehension and memory of details play roles, as well as ability to refer correctly pronoun usage if present like “she.”

But the query in particular here seems a straight detail-focused retrieval question about a reading text where students must locate the old book and identify where the protagonist or speaker discovered an ancient volume, in the attic in question.

This problem is similar others, but what makes challenging?

Let's imagine that during tests students usually tackle detail-fact identification, maybe even inference-type problems at 6th grade in English assessments. If it were inference, this question might be harder because students would be tasked to infer the location based on subtle cues or reasoning rather than just recall. But this specific prompt gives a clear factual recall
