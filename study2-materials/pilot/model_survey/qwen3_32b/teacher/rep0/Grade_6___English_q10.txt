Okay, let's try to figure out what percentage of grade 6 students in India would get all marks on this question. The sentence is comparing the difference in positive counts and questions for using some versus any.

So "There are... Some or... apples in the basket?" Well, I have learned in grade 7 English when teaching some/any to look back at the sentence structure for the correct word choice! If in an affirmative, use 'some'; for the general question or the negative, it is 'any’. 

Now students who are at that learning phase (Grade 6) probably know these rules in isolation. There may be confusions, like not knowing about when or when the other form is correct. The question is a fill-in-the-blunk type, not complicated sentence, and it is very direct—no tricks involved. For a student, recognizing that the subject has a positive structure will pick "some."

However a number of errors here can occur for various levels: Maybe if they misread the word for 'some' instead of thinking the correct use, maybe they don't get to remember any in negative structures.

The key thing, though, the problem here isn't too difficult. The context in a typical test item for some-any is
