Okay, let's break this down. First, the question given has the student choose between "some" and "any" in a sentence structure that includes negatives for clarity, since Grade 6 standards usually introduce these grammatical choices. The core question involves subject-verb agreement in negative and interrogative contexts: typically with "any" for negative sentences and questions when used in positive sentences (which the context might clarify).

For higher-performing students (~5): These would almost certainly understand the usage of "any" in negative questions and when followed by negatives ("not many") for affirmation contexts, versus positive usage like this. "Some" goes into an affirmation statement like the example given where presence is asserted (the sentence just says that something exists without contradiction), but needs careful parsing to differentiate from more ambiguous scenarios. The key phrase would guide them directly in this case—affirm "Some apples are present" versus "Are any present (no apples at all)" in questions like 'Do you see any apples?' So the top quintel's success is expected around full or very high success here.

Intermediate: Around 5 out of their 10 likely get it without trouble—depending if they can remember rule without deep comprehension, maybe fewer but I expect more correct
