**Calculation:**

1. **High-performing students (5):** They consistently do well (>80%). Even if this question focuses on identifying vocabulary, it assumes reading comprehension basics. These 5 would almost all get **1**, so 5 students × 1 = 50%
   
2. **Above-average performers (10):** Scoring 60-80%. These students grasp the core ideas but might struggle marginally with vocabulary nuances or inference (if "in/drawer/in attic" was part 100% = 100%

35)  
2. She saw birds in the park every morning because **the book says in**...  

3. 5 high performing  
6. 10 = **2 (5 x (5/1,5) +5 = (60–80%) 2 = ** (7.
