ELEMENTS: 
  1. vocabulary to recall ('some')
  2. number to manipulate ('many' as implicit count, though this can be assumed rather, not explicitly present but 'in the basket' has an associated expectation - there may actually not be many to assume but that isn't the correct way to frame an equation to this answer)

ELEMENT COUNT: N = 2
