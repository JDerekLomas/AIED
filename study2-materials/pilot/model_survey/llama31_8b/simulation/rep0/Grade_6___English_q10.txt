Predicted student performance breakdown on this question is as follows.

**High-performing students(~5): At least 90% of these students understand grammatical accuracy for the phrase 'there are' and possess the skill to select "correct and unqualified 'some' usage"; thus all, **5 out of 15 students in total.**
 
 **Above average: At most 80-90%** of this group is able to make a sound decision with the correct option for the question given the student population as an indication; considering an estimate **we could assume **8 (noting there are likely exceptions), as  the other 10 can possibly select incorrect answers; thus **(a maximum  8 + above average students in this case)** = 8 (from an assumption, not a high number given) +** average** + high performing gives an estimation of ** students with this question as 12.
 
Above-mentioned students: Total **8.**

- Average students (~10): The probability, based on the assumption that **5** above-average students can make this judgment,  this student ability group could choose **any 8** out of these as average to the student, and this results  as **3 in the ability average category (
