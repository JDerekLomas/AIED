To approximate the proportion of students scoring full marks, let's analyze the ability groups:

- **High-performing Students (5): All of these (5/5 = 1/0.33)**: Assuming high-performing students have thorough knowledge of English grammar as required, a great proportion is very likely to find this book 'in the simple attic'.

- **Above Average (10): Half of these (>10 *7/10 )= 5/10:** It is estimated to above-average students should answer such questions most time without problems - but a  50% hit rate  was applied. This makes about five. However they have  higher probability because it’s very specific detail but not always obvious.

- **Average students (10), none of the lower half - and most higher portion (> 50% - half that -10)/30= 15/60, but since we do not need 50, so (50%)/6 ( 60%-10=30), and half, we apply 1, we just use, and the total of ten): 5 of these** 
- This estimate was arrived based in fact: these students might not completely understand. The answer to what book the girl discovered. It may sound odd however
