Upon analysis, I would rate this question as moderate difficulty. Some aspects that contribute to its ease:

- It's related to a simple recall memory task of a character and their situation ('she,' possibly Riya based on her name being included) found inside the passage.
- It requires the correct answer from just reading a very basic context about the item of inquiry: where the person, she in that case Riya by context, placed her found reading object: the old or a book if the exact wording of she book was provided.

But on further thought there is significant possible incorrectness here, and that is what I want. Students might go very wrongly by: 
- Answering 'Where', rather than stating location like it asks to say.
- Providing incorrect location (like in backyard, library).
- Incorrect usage of possessives ('her book in the book').
