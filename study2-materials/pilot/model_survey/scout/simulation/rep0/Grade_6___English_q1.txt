To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks on this question, let's analyze the capabilities of each group:

1. **High-performing students (~5 students)**: These students are likely to understand the question, recall the relevant information, and write down the correct answer without any issues. It's reasonable to assume that all 5 high-performing students would answer correctly, i.e., "in the attic," "attic," or a similar correct phrase.

2. **Above-average students (~10 students)**: Most of these students are capable of understanding the question and have a good grasp of English. However, their answers might sometimes be affected by minor lapses in attention or expression. Given the simplicity of this question, it's likely that around 8 out of 10 above-average students would answer correctly.

3. **Average students (~10 students)**: These students have a fair understanding but might struggle with nuances of language or memory recall. For a straightforward question like this, about 5 out of 10 average students might answer correctly, assuming the question is within their grasp and they can recall the relevant information.

4. **Struggling students (~5 students)**: These students face significant challenges with English. It's possible that only 1 or 2 out of the 5
