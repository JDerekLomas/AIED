To estimate the proportion of students who would score full marks on this question, let's analyze the performance of each group:

1. **High-performing students (~5 students)**: These students are consistently scoring above 80%. Given their strong grasp of English, it is reasonable to assume that all 5 would get this question correct, as the concept of using "some" in a positive sentence is foundational. 

2. **Above-average students (~10 students)**: Scoring between 60-80% indicates a solid understanding of English basics. It's likely that most of these students would understand when to use "some" versus "any," with perhaps 1 or 2 exceptions due to carelessness or a momentary lapse in understanding. So, let's assume 8 out of 10 would get it correct.

3. **Average students (~10 students)**: With scores between 40-60%, these students have a more inconsistent grasp of English concepts. About half of these students might struggle with nuances like the difference between "some" and "any," or they might simply not know the rule. Let's assume 5 out of 10 would get it correct.

4. **Struggling students (~5 students)**: Scoring below 40% suggests significant difficulties with core concepts. It's
