**Estimating Item Difficulty**

To estimate the item difficulty of the question "Where did she find the old book?" from a Grade 6 English assessment in Indian government schools, let's consider what makes this question relatively easy or hard compared to similar English content at this grade level.

### What Makes This Question Relatively Easy or Hard

1. **Reading Comprehension Level**: This question requires basic reading comprehension skills, specifically the ability to recall a specific detail from a presumably short text. At Grade 6 level, most students are expected to have a good grasp of such skills.

2. **Language Complexity**: The question and the acceptable responses do not involve complex vocabulary or sentence structures that could pose a challenge to Grade 6 students.

3. **Question Type**: It is a direct recall question, which is generally easier than questions requiring inference, analysis, or synthesis.

### Potential for Error

- **Misreading the Text**: A student might misread the text and mistakenly identify the location where she found the old book, suggesting an incorrect location.

- **Absence of Context**: Without the actual text provided, students might not recall the exact detail about where she found the book. However, given that this is a question designed to test reading comprehension based on presumably provided text,
