To estimate the difficulty of this question and the proportion of Grade 6 students in Indian government schools who would score full marks, let's analyze the elements involved.

### Analysis of the Question

The question requires students to choose between "some" and "any" in the context of a sentence: "There are (some/any) apples in the basket." This is a basic grammar question focusing on the use of quantifiers.

- **"Some"** is used in positive sentences to indicate an unspecified amount or number of something.
- **"Any"** is typically used in negative sentences or in questions to indicate an unspecified amount or number of something.

1. **Lack of understanding of the quantifiers "some" and "any":** Students might confuse the usage rules.
2. **Overgeneralization:** Some students might incorrectly generalize that "any" is used for all types of sentences regardless of their positivity or negativity.
