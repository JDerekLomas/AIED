Most students in Grade 6 are likely to understand the basic structure of the question and have the prerequisite knowledge to answer it correctly. The question seems to communicate clearly what's expected. However, the assumption that all necessary context was provided about 'she' and the old book might not hold for all students, which could lead to some errors. Without specific context, it's reasonable to assume a fairly high proportion of students would still score full marks given the straightforward nature of the question.
