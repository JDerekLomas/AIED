To estimate the difficulty of this item for a Grade 6 student in an Indian government school, we must consider the linguistic transition typical of this demographic. At this stage, students are moving from basic decoding to reading comprehension, often in an environment where English is a Second Language (ESL) or even a third language.

### Qualitative Analysis

**1. What exactly could go wrong?**
*   **Vocabulary Mismatch:** The word **"attic"** is the primary hurdle. In the Indian context, "attic" is not a common household term. Most Indian homes have a *"loft"* or *"tand"*. If the source text did not explicitly and repeatedly link the location to the word "attic," students might understand she found it "upstairs" or "on a shelf" but fail to use the specific required term.
*   **Decoding the Question word:** Students often struggle with "Wh-" words. A common error is confusing **"Where"** (location) with **"When"** (time) or **"Why"** (reason), leading to responses like "long ago" or "because she was bored."
