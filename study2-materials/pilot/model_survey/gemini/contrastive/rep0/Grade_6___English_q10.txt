To estimate the difficulty of this item for a Grade 6 student in an Indian government school, we must consider the linguistic transition from local languages to English and the specific rules governing quantifiers.

### **Factors Influencing Difficulty**

**1. Semantic vs. Syntactic Cues**
In many Indian languages (like Hindi, Marathi, or Telugu), the distinction between "some" and "any" is not always represented by two different words in the same way. For example, in Hindi, *“kuch”* can translate to both "some" and "any" depending on the context. Students often rely on direct translation. Because "There are some apples" is a straightforward positive statement, it aligns with the first-learned translation of "some."

**2. The Negative/Interrogative Rule**
The primary procedural error occurs because students at this level are often taught "any" in the context of questions ("Are there any?") or negatives ("There aren't any"). If a student has only partially internalized this rule, they might overgeneralize. However, the absence of a "not" or a question mark in this specific item makes it structurally "simple."
