In a typical Grade 6 classroom of an Indian government school, the usage of "some" vs. "any" is a core grammar topic covered in early secondary English. However, while "some" sounds natural to most, many students struggle with the grammatical rule that "some" is used for affirmative sentences and "any" for negatives/questions.

Here is the breakdown of performance by ability group:

*   **High-performing (5 students):** All **5** are likely to get this right. They have a strong grasp of sentence flow and basic grammar rules.
*   **Above average (10 students):** **9** out of 10 would likely get this right. The sentence "There are some apples" sounds "correct" to the ear for students with a decent level of exposure.
*   **Average (10 students):** About **7** out of 10 would get this right. Some might get confused by overthinking the rule or by a simple 50/50 guess, but the affirmative nature of the sentence usually guides them toward "some."
*   **Struggling (5 students):** **2** out of 5 might get this right,
