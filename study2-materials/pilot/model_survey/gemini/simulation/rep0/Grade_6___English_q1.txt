In an Indian government school setting for Grade 6, English is often a second or third language (ESL/L2). This specific question tests **literal comprehension** and the ability to locate a specific detail from a passage (likely the classic story "The Fun They Had").

Here is the breakdown of the 30 students based on their ability groups:

### 1. High-Performing (5 students)
*   **Behavior:** These students have strong reading comprehension and grammar. They will likely answer in complete, grammatically correct sentences.
*   **Expected Score:** 5/5
*   **Responses:** "She found the old book in the attic of her house."

### 2. Above Average (10 students)
*   **Behavior:** These students understand the text well but might make minor spelling errors or provide shorter answers. This specific question is straightforward, so most will succeed.
*   **Expected Score:** 9/10 (One might accidentally write "in the school" or "at home" if they are rushing).
*   **Responses:** "In the attic," "She found the book in attic."

### 3. Average (10 students)
