To estimate the proportion of Grade 6 students who would score full marks on the question about choosing between "some" and "any," let's break down the considerations listed.

1. **Specific errors or misunderstandings that would cause students to lose marks**: The most common error could be confusing the rules for using "some" versus "any." Students might mistakenly choose "any" because it's often learned as a default for non-specific, plural nouns, not realizing that the distinction hinges on whether the sentence is positive, negative, or interrogative. Since this sentence is positive, "some" is correct. Another potential error could stem from not fully understanding the given that "apples" exist (it's a statement of fact, not a question or a negative statement), which should point towards using "some."

2. **How clearly does the question communicate what's expected?**: The question is clear and directly asks students to make a choice based on the context that there are apples in the basket. The task requires choosing the right word, making the intent straightforward.

3. **Prerequisite knowledge needed**: The grammar rule for using "some" versus "any." "Some" is typically used in positive sentences for countable nouns, while "any" is used in negative sentences and questions
